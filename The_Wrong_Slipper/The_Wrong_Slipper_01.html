<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: bold;" lang="EN-US">WARNING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is
somewhat edgy.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Ellen,
you lazy
little twit, come here this instant,&#8221; Janet Thatcher yelled.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Mum,&#8221; the small blond 17-year-old
responded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What's
wrong?" she scurried from
the living room into the kitchen where Mrs. Thatcher stood in front of
a sink
full of dirty dishes.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Didn't I tell you to wash these dishes and put
them
away before dinner?" the tall, heavyset woman demanded.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Mum, and I was going to do them right
after I
finished the vacuuming," the frightened teen replied.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"A likely story," Janet snapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If I didn't keep an eye
on you every
second nothing would get done around here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now come with me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grabbing
her stepdaughter by the ear, she forced the squealing young girl to
follow her
to the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seating
herself on
the arm of the couch, she pulled the petite girl over her lap, lifted
her short
skirt and yanked her panties down to her knees.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"No, Mum, please don't spank me in front of the
boys," the girl pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
two
younger stepbrothers looked up from their video game and grinned. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet's heavy hand descended on the girl's bare
bottom with
a resounding SPLAT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ellen
yelped with
pain and involuntarily kicked both legs, knocking over a large floor
lamp that
stood at the end of the couch.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Naughty, naughty girl,&#8221; her stepmother
thundered,
"If that lamp is broken, I will take the hide off your bottom with the
razor strap."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
continued the
spanking without slowing down, covering the bawling teen's bottom with
bright
red blotches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
two boys came over and
watched with interest. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As the girl squirmed under the fusillade of
spanks and
sobbed loudly in pain and humiliation. the older woman paused. "Henry,
bring me the hairbrush from my dresser, the big mahogany one. I am not
making
any impression on this silly child with my hand."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">16-year-old Henry dashed off to comply while
14-year-old
Roger reached out tentatively to touch his sister's red bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Ah, getting good and
warm,&#8221; he said
approvingly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Not as warm as it will be," his mother
promised
with an evil smirk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"By
the time I
am finished, we will be able to cook dinner on this brat's plump little
bottom."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Henry came dashing back to the living room and
handed his
mother the hairbrush. Ellen was still sobbing quietly, but mewed in
horrified
anticipation when she saw the heavy brush.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Her stepmother tapped it against the quivering
girl's
already red bottom and brought it down with a massive SMACK on her left
bottom
cheek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ellen howled
in pain and bucked
helplessly on the strong woman's lap.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She continued to howl as the heavy brush smacked into her
blistered
cheeks time after time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
she lay
exhausted and whimpering over her stepmother's knees, tears streaming
down her
cheeks and great purple splotches covering her abused bottom.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet set the brush down and smiled in
satisfaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"OK
boys, feel her bottom now and see
how warm it is."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
boys took
advantage of the opportunity to thoroughly explore the girl's anatomy,
patting,
pinching and prodding at will in her most sensitive private areas.
Ellen could
no nothing but sob in anguish as their fingers violated every aspect of
her
modesty.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Finally, Janet stood up, dumping the startled
girl onto the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Stand up,
young lady,
you've only gotten a little spanking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roger get my small sewing basket."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Roger dashed off and returned in a few minutes
with the
basket. Janet took out two large safety pins and fastened Ellen's short
skirt
to the back of her blouse, leaving her battered bottom on full view. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"All right Missy, " Janet directed. "Get your
lazy bottom out into that kitchen and make sure every dish is spotless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boys, I need you to set up
the dining room
table for eight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Baxters are coming
over for dinner, so use the good silverware and the blue-and-white
napkins and
placemats. If your stupid sister can get the dishes washed without
breaking any
of them, we will use those as soon as they are dry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Roger, you will help her dry
them."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The children went off to accomplish their
assigned tasks. Ellen
still sniffling and moving stiffly with the pain permeating her
buttocks and
thigh muscles.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet proceeded to the kitchen and completed
the preparation
for the meal, pausing to toss Ellen's discarded panties into the
laundry hamper
in the hall.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The Baxters arrived promptly at seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry met them at the door
and escorted them
to the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
and Rodney had
changed into neat but casual clothing and Janet had changed into a
semi-formal
dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ellen was
still in her schoolgirl
uniform with her skirt still pinned up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the sound of the doorbell, she ducked into the kitchen
and started to
undo the safety pins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Janet
noticed this
and grabbed her arm.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Just what do you think you're doing, young
lady?"
she asked in a menacing tone.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Putting my skirt down," the girl answered
fearfully. "I can't serve dinner like this!" </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"You can and you WILL," her stepmother stated
firmly. "You are still being punished and the Baxters will witness that
punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if
you don't behave
yourself, they will witness even more punishment, Is that clear?"</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Tears welled up in Ellen's eyes, "Yes, Mum."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet smiled. "Very good.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now wash your face, get all that makeup off
and bring in the hors d'oeuvres tray and see what people want for
drinks."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The Baxters consisted of George and Marcia
Baxter, their 18
year old son Frank, their 15 year old daughter Angela and Mrs. Baxter's
elderly
mother Caroline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frank's
eyes widened at
the sight of Ellen's bare bottom and Angela giggled briefly, but the
adults
seemed not to notice her odd attire. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">For the next 45 minutes, the adults chatted at
one end of
the room, the youngsters talked among themselves at the other end and
Ellen
circulated, bringing fresh drinks, replenishing hors d'oeuvres and
taking away
dirty dishes and glasses. She was acutely conscious of her bare bottom,
but
could not avoid displaying it at very close quarters to every person in
the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Dinner was much the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>George noted that there was only seating for eight whereas
there were
nine people in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I
say," he remarked, in a puzzled manner, "We seem to be a chair short
here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"No," Janet stated calmly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Ellen has been a naughty little girl
today and will not be seated at the table.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She will serve us and then make her own meal from the
leftovers in the
kitchen."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The Baxters nodded and Ellen's cheeks burned
red at this
latest humiliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
continued
serving in silence until she tripped over something and dropped a tray
of dirty
dishes. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Although only two small dishes were broken,
Janet Thatcher
was livid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You
clumsy child!"
she raged. "Clean that up immediately, and get me the big wooden spoon
from the kitchen."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The frightened teen rushed to comply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Thatcher took the
heavy wooden spoon
from the girl's trembling hands and pulled her heavy dining room chair
out into
an area where all the diners had a full view of it. "Kneel on that
chair,
young lady, and bend over."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen was already crying as she knelt on the
chair and
presented her already bruised bare bottom to the group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Janet pulled an ottoman up next to the
chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Put your
hands on the ottoman and
put your bottom well up in the air," she snapped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"And move your legs further apart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No, further still."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen wailed in fear and anticipation as she
complied,
knowing she was presenting all her most private parts to the guests and
her
younger brothers. Janet drew back the spoon and smacked the wide end
into her
stepdaughter's bottom with her full strength.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ellen screamed and wobbled on the chair. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Henry, come here and hold your sister,&#8221; Janet
directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry
came forward and, at his
mother's direction, slid the sobbing girl's skirt up further over her
back and grasped
her firmly around her bared waist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now
every inch of Ellen's body below her breasts was in full display.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet laid into the exposed tender skin with a
will,
covering the bruised bottom with more bruises and adding new bruises to
the
previously undamaged thighs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was
accompanied by wild howls and frantic gyrations of the tortured girl's
lower
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
Janet reversed the spoon
and used the narrow round handle like a cane to strike a dozen blows to
the
girl's exposed groove, rosebud and perineum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ellen screamed until her voice was reduced to a hoarse
croak and went
limp, with only Henry's firm grip preventing her from falling off the
chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet put down the spoon and smiled with
satisfaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Very
well, young lady, you may go to your
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roger and
Henry will finish
clearing the table."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She turned back to the table and addressed the
stunned
guests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Well that
should teach the
little minx a lesson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
we can retire
to the living room for coffee and cakes. Our serving girl is indisposed
at the
moment, but Henry and Roger will see to your needs."</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The Baxters slowly filed into the living room
as Ellen
slowly climbed down off the chair, limped to the doorway and slunk up
the
stairs to her room,</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
