<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">*************</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Next morning, 17-year-old Ellen woke up, sore and stiff from
her ordeal at Friday night's dinner party with the Baxters. Still in her
pajamas, she came down to set the breakfast table and get the kitchen ready for
her stepmother to prepare breakfast. She was startled to see Janet sitting at
the breakfast table fully dressed and scowling. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Well it's about time you got up, you lazy little
tart,&#8221; her stepmother snarled. "Since that episode last night, I have been
doing some checking and I am absolutely appalled at how much you have neglected
your duties. The boys' bathroom is filthy and their bedroom is full of dirty
laundry. Your bathroom is not much better and there is enough dust and grime in
the living room to raise potatoes in the rug. The newspapers and magazines are
strewn all around the cellar and the cans and bottles are not properly
separated. I declare, you can't have been doing half of your chores. Well that
is going to cease immediately."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet reached under the table and produced a heavy
leather-soled slipper. "From now on, every day is going to start off with
a good solid slippering. That may stimulate you to work a little harder. And
I'm going to have the boys keep an eye on you when I am not home.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She tapped the slipper on the palm of her hand for emphasis.
"Now get your pajamas off." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen whimpered softly, but removed her pajamas, leaving her
standing in her bra and panties in the middle of the kitchen. At that point,
her stepbrothers, 16-year-old Henry and 14-year-old Roger, entered the kitchen.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Ah good, you boys are just in time, " Janet
beamed. She kissed both boys and turned back to face the blushing teen girl. "All
right, missy, bend over the table and grab hold of the other edge."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen complied meekly, presenting her panty-clad bottom to
full view.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"OK, Roger, pull her panties down to below her knees,&#8221;
his mother directed. ""Let's take a close look at that bottom."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Mother and two boys proceeded to make a detailed inspection
of the mortified girl's private parts, including spreading the cheeks apart and
making a visual and tactile examination of her vulva and anus. Janet pronounced
herself satisfied. "Well most of the damage from last night has faded.
except for a few bruises. The little tart heals well anyway. OK boys, stand
back, it's time for her slippering. Observe closely, you boys will be doing
this quite frequently."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet grasped the heavy leather-soled slipper, which had
belonged to Ellen's late father, and brought it down with a resounding SMACK on
her stepdaughter's bare bottom. Ellen yelped in pain and involuntarily started
to rise from the table. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Oh, no you don't." Janet exclaimed. "Henry,
sit on the other side of the table; and hold your naughty sister's hands. Roger,
pull down her panties the rest of the way and take them off. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The boys grinned and complied, Henry taking a firm grip and
tugging the girl a bit forward to expose her bottom more fully as Roger pulled
down her panties and tossed them onto the couch. Janet looked at the position
and directed Roger to get a pillow from the couch. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When he appeared with the pillow, Janet said, "OK, now
lift her up a bit and slide the pillow under her hips." In that position,
Ellen's bottom was elevated still more and her feet no longer touched the
floor. Janet laid on another hard smack with the slipper and Ellen cried out
again.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Perfect," the stepmother said. "I can get a
good solid smack every time here." She proceeded to spank the bawling girl
repeatedly with the heavy slipper, turning her bottom bright red and causing
her to buck, kick and squirm frantically, but unable to avoid the relentless
spanking. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Finally, the big woman stopped spanking and allowed the
blubbering teen to stand up. Ellen danced and hopped around the kitchen
frantically trying to rub the sting out of her thoroughly blistered bottom. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet laughed. "Boys, this is what we call the 'spanked
little girl dance.' Most entertaining, especially in front of company. You will
be seeing a lot of that dance in the next few weeks."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She addressed the sobbing girl. "OK, little brat, find
your panties, put them on go out and get the morning paper."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen was thunderstruck. "I can't go out to the street
in just my bra and panties,&#8221; She pleaded desperately. There are lots of people
up and around, somebody will see me. Please don't make me do that."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet smiled. "OK, little girl. You can go out there
just as you are, without your panties. And one more word and I&#8217;ll take your bra
off as well and you can be completely naked. "</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen shivered in terror, but moved slowly and reluctantly
toward the front door, still rubbing her very red bottom. At the front door,
she hesitated as she could see several neighbors in their yards, a few cars and
kids on bicycles in the street. Janet came up from behind her and smacked her bare
bottom with the slipper. "Go now, girl, or the bra comes off, too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen's facial cheeks were burning almost as red as her
bottom cheeks as she walked slowly down the pathway to the sidewalk and
retrieved the daily newspaper. Some of the smaller kids pointed and giggled,
two older boys stared and whistled and several adults waved and called out
cheerfully to her. Finally, she covered the forty feet to the box and the forty
feet back to the front door, but it seemed like several miles and she was sure
that half the town population had observed her red bottom. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Very good," Janet remarked as Ellen handed her
the paper. "Now for the ground rules for your conduct. While you are in
the house and yard after school and on non-school days, you will wear nothing
but your bra and panties, unless you have express permission to wear more
clothing. You will get the paper every morning and the mail very afternoon, and
you will also answer the door and take out the garbage in the same
costume." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen moaned, but wisely said nothing. Her wicked stepmother
continued. &#8220;if you have been punished that day, you will go bare-bottomed for
the rest of the day and night. That way all the neighbors can see what a
well-spanked bottom looks like on a naughty little girl.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"While you are at home and I am not present, the boys
will supervise you in the performance of your chores and the completion of your
homework. Should they find any fault in any aspect of your performance, they
will have full authority to pull down your panties, take you over their knees
or bend you over a convenient piece of furniture and spank your bare bottom
with their hands, the slipper or the spanking paddle that is hanging in the
kitchen. If they think you need a hairbrushing, they will call me on my cell
phone for permission to use that."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"They may decide to spank you at any time, for any
offense, or even if they simply feel like doing it. You will be spanked on the
bare bottom and they may put you in the corner bare-bottomed if they so decide.
And they may do so regardless of the presence of younger or older children or
adults. They may not spank you in the front yard, but they may do so in the
back yard. If you use the swimming pool, either on your own volition or at
their direction, you will be completely nude and remain so until they give you
permission to put on your underwear."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Finally, if they decide that you should go completely nude
for a period of time inside the house, you will do so. Should they wish to
inspect any part of your body or display it to their friends, you will comply
with their directions. They may not use you or allow others to use you in a
sexual manner, but touching, rubbing and visual display is permitted,"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Now do any of you have any questions about the
rules?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Roger grinned, "What about enemas?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet considered that as Ellen squeaked in terror. "No,
neither of you have any practice in giving enemas. We may do some training on
that later. But, while she is in the bathroom whether to shower, bathe or use
the toilet, she will leave the door fully open so that you can be sure she
isn't playing with herself or doing anything else forbidden. And after she uses
the toilet, you should inspect her to ensure that she has cleaned herself
adequately. If there are guests in the house, you may choose to do the
inspection in the living room where our guests can observe the process. That
will require you to check her private parts with a bath tissue and wipe her
bottom with a baby wipe. If you find she has not adequately cleaned her bottom,
give her five hard smacks with the plastic bath brush."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She looked around for further questions but there were none.
"OK, let&#8217;s have breakfast now and then you kids can get on with your
chores."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
