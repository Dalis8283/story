<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">*************************</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">After breakfast, the Thatcher family scattered to do their
morning chores. Stepmother Janet loaded the dishwasher and cleaned up the
kitchen. Her two sons went out back and began cutting the lawn and weeding the
garden. Stepdaughter Ellen, clad only in her bra and panties, got a bucket,
brush and some old rags and began to clean out the boys' bathroom. She was just
finishing up when the doorbell rang. Janet yelled out, "Get the door
Ellen."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Reluctantly, the scantily clad teen opened the front door
and discovered three teenage boys gawking at the exposed girl skin. 16-year-old
Freddie Parker smiled and said, "Hi Ellie, are Hank and Roger
around?" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"They're out back in the garden, " Ellen replied
quickly, hoping the boys would go around the side of the house and allow her to
close the door. they might have done just that if Janet had not suddenly
appeared behind her. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Freddie! Josh! Sammy! Come on in boys, &#8220; Janet beamed.
"Come on in and have some soda or juice,&#8221; I think there are some cookies
left over too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The three boys came in and headed for the kitchen. "Forget
to get dressed, Ellie?" Josh smirked. "You look cute in your
undies."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen blushed furiously and was tongue tied. Janet laughed. "Ellen
is being punished. She just had a good slippering and will get more later. Show
the boys your bottom, Ellen."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen turned around and posed reluctantly. Janet shook her
head. "No, child, I said your BOTTOM, not your panties." Stepping
forward, she grasped the waistband and pulled Ellen's panties down to her
knees. "Now bend over and give them a good show."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen whined and tried to edge away from the three boys.
"Please don't do this, Mummy," she whimpered. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet shook her head. "Always the disobedient child. Sammy,
get me the small paddle that's hanging in the kitchen."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"No, please, I'll do it," Ellen cried and bent
over as far as she could.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Too late, little missy, " Janet growled. "You
obviously have not grasped the concept of instant obedience." She took the
paddle from a smirking Sammy and smacked her stepdaughter full on the already
reddened bottom. Now drop those panties to the floor and step put of
them."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The cringing girl complied. Just then Roger and Henry came
back into the house. Janet saw them and smiled grimly. "Looks like it's
time for the afternoon entertainment, boys. Roger, take your sister's panties
and toss them into the laundry basket. She won't be needing them any more
today. Oh, and you might as well unhook her bra and take that too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Ellen began wailing loudly, "Please don't do this to
me, Mummy, I haven't done anything bad enough to deserve this." She
struggled briefly as Roger unhooked her bra and removed it and then stood naked
in front of the five boys and her mother, weeping in frustration and
humiliation.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Always the whiner," Janet sneered. "OK for
the first event, Freddie, bring out that straight chair and put Ellen over your
lap. Have you ever spanked a girl as old as Ellen?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"No, ma'am,&#8221; Freddie replied, with a broad smile on his
face. "But I think I know how to do it."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Well we will let you practice a bit then first."
Janet smiled. "Go ahead and start spanking her with your hand. Don't be
afraid to spank hard, her bottom may look tender, but it is built for
punishment."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Freddie began spanking tentatively, but soon was bringing
his hand down on the squirming girl's bottom with full force and vigor. Ellen
was already weeping when the spanking began and was soon sobbing forlornly as
the boy's large hands smacked down again and again on the tender skin of her
bottom. At Janet's suggestion, Freddie paused from time to time to run his
hands up and down her legs and bottom, rubbing and fondling her inner thighs
and private parts. he occasionally separated her bottom cheeks and let his
fingernails scrape gently over the ultra-sensitive flesh between her vulva and
rosebud. At this total violation of her most private areas, Ellen let out a
wail of anguish and bucked and squirmed heroically, but to no avail.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet inspected her stepdaughter's bottom and nodded her
approval. She handed Freddie the paddle and said, "OK, now for the main
event. Paddle every square inch of her bottom and go down a few inches onto the
thighs. Make sure you cover everything and put special emphasis on the crease
where her little folds of baby fat meet the tops of her thighs."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Freddie swung into his new task with vigor and enthusiasm. His
helpless victim, howled and bawled, kicked her legs frantically, clenched and
unclenched her bottom cheeks and squirmed and twisted her bottom around on his
lap in a vain effort to dodge the remorseless rising and falling of the paddle.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Finally, the spanking was over and Ellen lay broken and
blubbering over Freddie's lap, unable to speak or even move her legs in a coordinated
manner. Freddie began rubbing her bottom slowly and the other boys moved in to
observe and feel the heat and redness of the teen's abused flesh. Josh slyly
reached under her to feel her breasts and she squeaked in protest, but Janet
noticed the move and reassured him. "It's OK, Josh, you can all feel her
boobs, play with her nipples or anything else you want to do with her body that
doesn't involve penetration. I know boys don't get much chance to play with
nude girls your own age, so take full advantage of the opportunity."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Totally exhausted, physically numb and emotionally drained,
Ellen could only lie helplessly over Freddie&#8217;s lap as the five boys explored
their new toy. Her crying had subsided to a low throaty moan with an occasional
whimper as a particularly sensitive area of her private parts was poked,
prodded, pinched of fondled.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>



<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Janet beamed in satisfaction as she observed her hated
step-daughter's mortification. This small, helpless child was a constant
reminder of the man she had never loved and who had left most of his money to
the girl's trust fund, depriving Janet and her boys of the opportunity to live
in luxury on his hard-earned fortune. Someday she would find a way to break
that will, but in the meantime, her only satisfaction would come in ensuring
that the little slut got what she deserved. At times, Janet had considered
killing the girl, but that would have cost her what limited control over the
trust fund she had and the funds would have reverted to Ellen's three cousins
in Minneapolis.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As the boys' interest in their almost comatose toy dwindled,
Janet spoke up. "OK, we have cookies, soda and lemonade in the kitchen. Leave
the little brat on the couch for a while and we'll have a snack."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
