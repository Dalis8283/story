<b style="">Hanna&#8217;s Embarrassing Accident! </b>(reluctant
exhibitionism, self-discovery.)<br>
By <b style="">Hooked6</b> (<a href="mailto:Hooked6@hotmail.com">Hooked6@hotmail.com</a>)</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter
13</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">This couldn&#8217;t be happening!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The six classmates of mine that I had spotted
earlier at a table across the Food Court had finished their meals. As they were
picking up their trash to head out, I saw one of the guys pointing right at me
with a surprised look on his face!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon
all the others were mesmerized by the site of a poor invalid girl sitting in a
wheelbarrow covered with two paper napkins! &#8220;Please don&#8217;t come over, PLEASE!&#8221; I
begged under my breath. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to see here. Just go about your
business. PLEASE, just go on about your business . . . DAMN IT . . . They&#8217;re
coming this way!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">In a matter of seconds the group was scurrying
over to my table. &#8220;Hanna? Is that you?!&#8221; Becky called out giggling. &#8220;What on
earth . . .?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You look like<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>. . . oh Hell, I don&#8217;t know WHAT you look like,&#8221; Jimmy mocked. &#8220;What are
you trying to pull anyway?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Susan whispered something to Becky and then said
giggling, &#8220;You DO realize you&#8217;re like almost naked in the mall, right? Aren&#8217;t
you afraid of what people might think or that you&#8217;re going to get into trouble?
&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There&#8217;s nothing more humiliating than being
laughed at by your peers. A person can stand tall and deal with a lot of
adverse things in life but being laughed at is the absolute pits.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh this is too rich? I&#8217;ve GOT to get a
picture.&#8221; Carl quipped as he pulled out his smart phone.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you even THINK about it, buster!&#8221; I
yelled menacingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m hurt, Okay? Isn&#8217;t that obvious? I fractured several
bones and got hurt really bad and to top it all off I just had a little
accident here in the mall. It&#8217;s not funny. It&#8217;s not funny at all. Can&#8217;t you cut
me some slack for once?&#8221; I kept looking around for Donna but my classmates were
blocking my view. Where in the hell is she? Why is she taking so long? I
wondered. I needed her to come to my rescue. Donna may be a lot of things but
one thing she is good at is thinking on her feet. If she were here she
certainly would protect me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, I can see that you&#8217;re hurt,&#8221; Becky said
still giggling, &#8220;But you&#8217;re . . . like Susan said . . . pretty much NAKED, well
almost naked! And what&#8217;s up with the stupid wheelbarrow, anyway?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story. Some friends brought me here
to cheer me up and, well I can&#8217;t walk so this is what they came up with so I
could get around. If any of you has a better idea I&#8217;d like to hear it.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You mean, like, you should have stayed at
home?&#8221; Jimmy suggested sarcastically.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You were brought here by some friends, huh?
Where are these &#8216;friends&#8217; anyway? I don&#8217;t see anybody. You know what I think? I
think you&#8217;re just a slutty showoff, that&#8217;s what I think. I&#8217;ll bet your getting
off on all this, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Becky said laughing snidely.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I was about to really tear into Becky when a man
hurried by my table as if he was late for something important and the breeze he
created as he walked by blew the napkin that covered my chest clean off my body
and onto the floor. I watched in shock as it tumbled along the tiles behind the
man as he scurried away. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;OH MY GAWD,&#8221; Becky squealed. &#8220;She has no tits!
They&#8217;re just puffy-looking bumps with nipples!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>EVERYONE laughed at her comment, even some strangers that were still
eating at a nearby table.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My heart was practically pounding out of my
chest. I was topless and everyone in the group was laughing hysterically! I
wanted to just curl up into a ball and die. My chest was now exposed to SIX
people that I went to school with. My secret was no longer a secret. Yes, I
often used a padded bra and YES I wasn&#8217;t proud of it, but up to now I didn&#8217;t
think anyone else knew about it or knew how self-conscious I was about my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Would one of you PLEASE get me another
napkin?&#8221; I snapped angrily.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to feel embarrassed, Hanna. I
think you&#8217;re rather cute,&#8221; Mike said sincerely. &#8220;I really do. It was an
accident that your napkin flew off. There&#8217;s no reason for them to laugh at you.
You have a beautiful body. Not everyone can have a body like a movie star you
know. Be happy with what you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Though he may have been trying to make me feel
better, his comment only made me all the angrier knowing that he was studying
my body, realized that it was less than perfect and was trying to get me to
accept that fact. &#8220;GET ME SOMETHING TO COVER WITH!&#8221; I snapped growing impatient
as these classmates seemed intent on just letting me stay uncovered as they
made fun of my body. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;All right, all right, keep your shirt on,&#8221; Mike
said as he went over to the dispenser to pull another napkin out for me. &#8220;I was
only trying to help.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I think we should leave her like this.&#8221; Becky
teased. &#8220;It&#8217;s less conspicuous than those silly napkins. After all, she looks
like a little kid so I doubt that anyone will complain.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;STOP IT!&#8221; I screamed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had your fun.
Just leave me alone!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Fine . . . if that&#8217;s what you want, we&#8217;ll be
glad to oblige. You don&#8217;t have to get all high and mighty about it.&#8221; With that
they all left, giggling as they departed as if it was all one big joke to them.
They appeared to be all of one mind knowing that I was helpless and exposed and
thought it would be funny if they left me that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO wait!&#8221; I exclaimed in a panic, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
leave!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Becky turned around and I felt relieved as I
thought she was coming back to cover me but instead I saw her raise her phone
and take a picture of me. &#8220;See you in school,&#8221; she snickered and walked off
with the others.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After they had disappeared, I saw Donna making
her way towards me. &#8220;What was that all about? Who were those people?&#8221; she asked
with a smile as she grabbed another napkin to toss over my chest. I didn&#8217;t
answer her as I was pissed. I just wanted to sulk. Besides I was convinced she
wasn&#8217;t really concerned at all but rather only wanted to hear all the salacious
details of my embarrassing encounter with our peers so she could relish them in
her twisted mind.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s keeping that woman?&#8221; she
finally asked as she looked around. &#8220;She had plenty of time to dry that gown.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I began to get a bad feeling shooting up my
spine. She was right. Where WAS that woman? She seemed so nice. She certainly
didn&#8217;t seem the type to just run off with my gown. Still, Donna had a point.
She had plenty of time to dry it off and return it to me. Something must have
happened. I just couldn&#8217;t be stranded at the mall without any clothes. I just
couldn&#8217;t! The thought was too unbearable to think about. The worried look on
Donna&#8217;s face wasn&#8217;t helping matters either. The all-confident Donna didn&#8217;t seem
so confident now and that scared the crap out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I needed my rock to cling to. If SHE was
getting worried I was in real trouble!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Maybe . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Maybe what?&#8221; I asked nervously.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Maybe I should go and try to find her. Perhaps
it&#8217;s just taking her longer to dry that thing with the hand drier in the ladies
room than she thought.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh no, you&#8217;re not leaving me alone like this
again. I&#8217;m going with you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Without arguing, Donna picked up the handles of
my wheelbarrow and began to push it towards the corridor off the Food Court
where the restrooms were located. No sooner had she started walking my napkin
blew off again just like it had before leaving me topless once again. Donna
immediately set the wheelbarrow down and ran off to pick up my napkin and
replaced it. As soon as I was covered she resumed walking only this time at a
much slower pace. Unfortunately the same thing happened once <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>more despite all of her caution. &#8220;This
isn&#8217;t going to work.&#8221; She sighed in exasperation. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She let out a deep sigh as she earnestly looked
around the Food Court trying to find that woman, but it was of no use. She
wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen. I thought of a dozen reasons that this person could
have been delayed but none of them were good. I felt another panic attack
brewing deep within my being. I was frightfully close to losing it when Donna
snapped her fingers, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; she said with an air of that old confidence
that was her trademark. She had me lift my butt up a few inches as she grabbed
the pillow out from under me that I had been sitting on. &#8220;This will keep your
top covered at least,&#8221; she said as she placed the small couch pillow on my
chest. The pillow was heavier than the paper napkin so it stayed in place as
she lifted the wheelbarrow once more and began walking. The small square plush
pillow did indeed cover my boobs and the napkin that I desperately clutched
between my legs hid the essentials down below. It wasn&#8217;t the perfect fix but it
worked and I was grateful. I only hoped it wasn&#8217;t a permanent solution and that
we would soon find that lady and my gown. I never would have thought that I
would miss something that only moments before I had thought was hideous and
juvenile. Now I would have given anything just to get it back.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To make matters worse, as we made our way
towards the restroom corridor, I became aware that my frantic and forceful
clutching of the napkin between my tightly closed legs to keep it in place
resulted in it scrunching up into a tube-like wad so that it hardly covered any
of my lower pelvic area. True, my vagina was adequately hidden by the paper
napkin, but my pubic area, which once had boasted my proud little bush, was now
basically completely uncovered. Instead a small, thin tube of paper, much like
a cigarette would look if it was shoved into the cleft of my vulva, was
pointing skyward as if it were a little erect penis. It looked really stupid! I
dared not move my thighs however as I was afraid I&#8217;d lose even this little
piece of covering. As stupid as it looked it made me feel at least a little
more secure. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna parked me in the corridor next to the
&#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; restroom. &#8220;Wait here, I&#8217;ll be right back . . . and try not to get
into any trouble while I&#8217;m gone, will you?&#8221; I just gave her a dirty look which
only made her laugh as she disappeared into the ladies room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">People were passing me by, both men and women,
as they made their way into their respective lavatories. The looks I got ranged
from pity to confusion to downright playful. Mercifully no one said a word. I
wouldn&#8217;t have known how to respond if they had. I just sat there in my stupid
wheelbarrow and tried to make myself invisible &#8211; which is a hard thing to do
when people are gawking at you.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">A few moments later I saw Donna emerge from the
Ladies room with a faraway look in her eyes. &#8220;She&#8217;s not there,&#8221; she finally
confessed as if she was having a hard time believing it herself. &#8220;She&#8217;s really
not there.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Maybe she went into another restroom someplace
else,&#8221; I suggested hopefully.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No, this is the one I saw her go into. I
watched her myself. I KNOW this is where she went. Oh Hanna, I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What the hell am I going to do now?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna bent down and ran her fingers softly
through my hair. &#8220;Maybe we passed her making our way over here and she just
didn&#8217;t see us. I think maybe we should have stayed where we were. Let&#8217;s go back
to our table and wait a little longer,&#8221; she said trying to sound encouraging.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we will find her eventually. She was such a nice woman. Things will
work out, you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wanted so badly to believe her. I looked at
the clock in the corridor. We still had almost 2 hours before we had to meet
the bus back to our village. We certainly had time to wait for this lady and if
it meant getting my silly teddy bear gown back I was all for it. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said
meekly. &#8220;Sounds like a good idea to me.&#8221; I lied of course, but what else could
we do?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The Food Court had emptied out even more and
most of the tables were now empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was a good thing if this lady was indeed trying to spot us as we could easily
see each other if that were the case. But that was also a bad thing too. With
the place no longer crowded with people, I stuck out like a sore thumb &#8211; no
longer screened from view by all those diners eating their meals as I had been
before. Make no mistake the MALL was still crowded and the halls lined with
stores were bustling with people. It was just the seating area that was
practically empty so all those people passing by in the main part of the mall
going to and from the various stores had a clear shot of me if they looked my
way - the silly girl with casts covered by a pillow with a cigarette-looking
piece of paper sticking out between her legs.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Time passed and I began to lose heart as there
was no sign of this lady. My mind could only think about the bus ride home. I
couldn&#8217;t go back with only a pillow for cover. I just COULDN&#8217;T! It was bad
enough just sitting here like I was. The thought of having the bus driver pick
me up completely naked in front of all those passengers was more than I could
bear. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Watching the people pass by in their summer
clothes and beautiful dresses I felt really vulnerable and at risk. They all
seemed so much loftier and superior to little ole me, naked and cringing in a
wheelbarrow in the middle of a crowded mall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What was most bewildering to me was the fact that deep down, however,
all I could think about was how wet I was and how much I really wanted to
finger myself! What was wrong with me? I could feel my little scrunched up
napkin getting totally soaked by my own arousal. I was so mortified that
someone might notice, yet that very thought made me all the more excited. I
know that doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense but that&#8217;s how I felt.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My immediate thought was, &#8220;Oh crap, she
noticed!&#8221; I swallowed hard and expected the worst. I meekly replied, &#8220;Yes . .
.?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We have to try and get you some clothes.&#8221; I
really hate to say this but I think we are going to have to go through the mall
and find someplace to get something you can wear.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;GO OUT THERE . . . among all those people . . .
LIKE THIS?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well, I COULD go try and find something for you
myself but I&#8217;d have to leave you alone.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The thought of being left alone in this strange
place was totally out of the question and I told her so. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just get this
over with,&#8221; I finally said resigning myself to my fate.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna picked up the handles of my wheelbarrow
and started towards the main hall of the mall. The noise level rose
exponentially the closer we got the hordes of people shopping and milling
about. As the noise increased so did my anxiety level! I closed my eyes and
grit my teeth telling myself that if I couldn&#8217;t see them it might be easier.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">WRONG! As soon as we hit the main interior
corridor I almost panicked again. Conversations were all a jumble and I couldn&#8217;t
make out if people were talking about me or not. I HAD to open my eyes. To my
surprise there were so many people that Donna had to constantly ask the
shoppers to excuse us and make room for the &#8220;handicapped girl,&#8221; which people
gladly did. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Injured girl here, please excuse us. Make way,
please for the injured girl,&#8221; she repeated over and over again. And people
heeded her call. I think I got more sympathy with her saying that than I would
have gotten if we had just strolled along in silence. Comments like, &#8220;Oh the
poor dear,&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet that must have hurt,&#8221; were commonplace.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that there were so many shoppers
actually helped minimize the number of people that actually saw me &#8211; well ALL
of me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna abruptly stopped and entered a store. &#8220;This
is the place I was looking for.&#8221; she announced with pride. &#8220;They&#8217;re bound to
have something you can wear here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The business was a trendy women&#8217;s fashion store
that seemed to cater to the younger set. Summer apparel was prominently
displayed in the windows as we entered the store.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Donna,&#8221; I said quietly. &#8220;You DO remember that
back home I couldn&#8217;t even get into my own clothes let alone any of these
things. What in the world can we find in here that I could wear?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I know that silly. The reason I chose this
place was that it wasn&#8217;t only close to the Food Court but they sell swimsuits
too. I thought that maybe we could get you something like that. What do you
think?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well . . . it could work. I mean I&#8217;ve seen
people getting off the bus back home in their swimwear for a day at the beach.
I guess that would be okay. It sure beats riding the bus naked,&#8221; I said with a
nervous laugh. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As we were talking, a young, college aged, very
attractive girl came up and looked us over. &#8220;Can I HELP you?&#8221; she asked
incredulously. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna cleared her throat and started doing what
she did best &#8211; lying. &#8220;Oh yes, please!&#8221; she replied excitedly. &#8220;As you can see
my friend here has suffered several injuries and I was taking her out for a day
of shopping when she had another little accident and, well, it&#8217;s a long story,
but the bottom line is that she ruined the hospital gown she was wearing &#8211; the
ONLY the thing she had.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Is she . . . NAKED under that pillow?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Yes, ma&#8217;am&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry
but if you could help us out of the entrance here and get something for me that
I can wear I&#8217;d be VERY grateful.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The girl just shook her head. &#8220;This is some kind
of college initiation thing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Donna replied trying her best to
sound sincere.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you two are up to but I&#8217;m
game. Follow me,&#8221; she said giggling as she led the way to the back of the
store. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna dropped the wheelbarrow in front of the
dressing area and helped me to the bench in front of the mirrors located
outside the changing area. &#8220;I thought we could get her a swimsuit- a bikini
works best,&#8221; she said plainly. &#8220;With her casts and bad leg she has trouble
getting into anything else. &#8220;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As I sat there right in plain view in the back
of the store desperately hugging my pillow for cover, the salesgirl led Donna
off into the racks of clothing. Mercifully the store wasn&#8217;t THAT busy. In a few
moments they came back with what looked like a two piece blue bikini. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;If you would help her stand and hold her
steady,&#8221; Donna asked, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get her dressed.&#8221; The girl readily agreed and
before I knew what was happening the girl pulled me from the chair and stood me
up against the wall, my pillow falling unceremoniously to the ground<span style="">&nbsp; </span>along with my VERY wet paper napkin, leaving
me stark naked in a store full of people!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Donna took her time fumbling with the bikini bottom trying to get it
aligned right before attempting to put it on. She wasn&#8217;t fooling me. I knew
darn well she was only using that as an excuse to keep me exposed as long as
possible. Finally she felt satisfied that she had the garment the right way
round and pulled it up my legs and adjusting it into place. She then put on my
top and stepped back to admire her handiwork. &#8220;Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked
me with a certain pride.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I simply nodded my head. At least I was finally
covered!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You know as nice as this looks,&#8221; the sales girl
interrupted, &#8220;if you are riding the bus back to your village. I think I have
something that might work out a little better for your friend here if you are
willing to wait a minute.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;SURE! We&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; I answered immediately
before Donna could say something to jeopardize my chance at decency.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The girl returned with what looked like a long
T-shirt. &#8220;This is a swimwear cover-up. It has very narrow shoulder straps and
wide arm holes so I think she could get into it just fine. Besides it&#8217;s opaque
and long enough to be decent to wear on the bus. Would you like to try that
instead?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;YES, please!&#8221; I said quickly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna stripped me of my bikini leaving me once
more completely naked only THIS time I had an audience of several teens that
had noticed me as I entered the store and had made their way back to the
dressing areas to check me out. As embarrassing as that was having them gawk at
me I could see light at the end of the tunnel so I just did my best to ignore them.
The pretty salesgirl put the cover-up over my head and she was indeed correct.
It fit perfectly!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We&#8217;ll take it!&#8221; I said excitedly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That will be $49.95 plus tax,&#8221; the salesgirl
said. I can ring you up from the tag without you having to take the garment off
again.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna got a flushed look and all the color ran
out of her face. &#8220;Umm . . . $49.95?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Yes, that&#8217;s a bargain too. It&#8217;s one of the
cheapest things we have in the store.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Umm . . . I don&#8217;t suppose . . . that is . . .
do you think that you could lend us this garment until we get her home? I
promise I&#8217;ll bring it back tomorrow.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Just what are you trying to pull, young lady?
What do you take me for, anyway? If I let you leave this store without paying
I&#8217;ll never see that cover-up again and I&#8217;ll be out over FIFTY dollars and that
will come out of my pay! Hell no, you can&#8217;t borrow this garment.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to rip you off, honest. I just
wasn&#8217;t thinking. I don&#8217;t really have that much money on me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well, how much DO you have?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna rummaged through her pocket and held out
her hand and sounding rather pathetic admitted, &#8220;One dollar and sixty-five
cents.&#8221; She then turned to me and practically begged me to forgive her. &#8220;I
really didn&#8217;t think. Hanna. I was just trying to get you something to wear. I
forgot all about having to PAY for things. I just wasn&#8217;t thinking. I&#8217;m really
sorry.&#8221; I could tell Donna was serious because I could actually see tears
welling up in her eyes. I wasn&#8217;t the only one who noticed either. The sales
girl spotted them too.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I have an idea here. I&#8217;m not really supposed to
do this but I have a way you can help your friend out and help me at the same
time.&#8221; The salesgirl put her arm around Donna&#8217;s shoulder and continued, &#8220;If you
would be willing to work for me for an hour doing a little marketing work, I&#8217;ll
let your friend here have the garment. &#8220;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;CERTAINLY,&#8221; Donna replied without hesitation. I
can do that.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The salesgirl left the area and came back with a
small box and a stack of paper fliers that looked to be 5 inches by 7 inches in
size advertising a summer swimwear clearance sale. &#8220;I&#8217;ll need you to walk
around in here and in the mall in front of the store handing out these sales
advertisements. Can you do that for me?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure that will be easy,&#8221; Donna said. &#8220;We have
plenty of time for me to do that and catch our bus!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh and this is for you too,&#8221; the salesgirl said
as she handed the decorative box to my friend.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s this? More fliers?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No, silly, that&#8217;s your outfit. You&#8217;ll need to
wear that as you hand out the fliers.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna swallowed hard and reluctantly opened the
box. What she pulled out surprised even me!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wear this!&#8221; Donna protested. &#8220;That&#8217;s
insane!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You don&#8217;t HAVE to wear that. I can always just
take back the cover-up your friend here is wearing and then call security
because I THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF by bringing a naked girl into my
respectable store and making up some cock and bull story about her being
injured!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But it&#8217;s all TRUE,&#8221; I said in a panic.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well if that&#8217;s so then I&#8217;m sure your friend
here won&#8217;t mind helping you out. Now what&#8217;s it going to be. Are you going to
work to pay for that garment or do you want me to strip your friend here and
call security for public indecency and possible attempted theft? Hurry up and
make up your mind. I haven&#8217;t got all day.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I looked at Donna practically pleading for her
to do this for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could tell Donna
was wrestling with this and deep down I really did think she felt bad for me. I
just hoped that she actually had a conscience somewhere deep down inside and
would do the right thing. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Something didn&#8217;t seem quite right, but I
couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it exactly.</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter
15</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna helped me back into my chair and put the
fliers on the floor next to me. Taking one long last look at the little box,
she reluctantly went into the dressing room. She was in there quite a while and
I was beginning to think she was chickening out and was going to change her
mind. I began to formulate my options for the bus ride back home if that
happened when suddenly I saw her peeking out her head around the corner. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m actually going to do this!
You OWE me BIG time, girl.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The sales girl came back and seeing Donna took
her by the hand and pulled her out into the store. Doing her best to imitate
that Hollywood actor she exclaimed in a schmaltzy voice, &#8220;You look MARVELOUS .
. . simply MARVELOUS.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The swimsuit was even more daring than it had
looked in the box. The top consisted of two small light tan triangles that
barely covered Donna&#8217;s nipples. Since my friend&#8217;s breasts were much more ample
than mine most of her boobs were exposed &#8211; especially when viewed from the
side. The strings that held the top in place around her neck were so ultra-thin
that it was hard to see them as the color of the fabric so closely matched
Donna&#8217;s skin tone. The bottom was similarly revealing. It was a thong-type
design with a small triangle covering her pubic area &#8211; and I mean BARELY
covering her pubic area and another thin, nearly transparent string ran up
between her butt cheeks. When Donna stepped back so the salesgirl could admire
the view, it looked like my friend was naked &#8211; except that she wasn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said, the color of the fabric so
closely matched the color of Donna&#8217;s skin that it blended in so well it was
downright eerie!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If one looked closely
enough in the right light one could tell she was wearing a suit but at a
distance . . . well . . . she was for all intents and purposes . . . nude. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Here are your fliers,&#8221; the salesgirl said
handing them to my friend. &#8220;If you need more there&#8217;s a box at the front
counter. Just help yourself. It&#8217;s almost two o&#8217;clock now, so just keep working
until three o&#8217;clock and then you can call it a day. Any problems just come and
get me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna looked at me for a moment then back at the
store employee, gave her a tentative nod then shuffled the papers in her hand
as if she was getting ready to go. Much to my surprise she actually started
doing the job by walking around the back of the store near the dressing rooms
handing out the fliers! I felt bad for her walking around like that. Her outfit
was so inappropriate for the business setting we were in. What was really bad
was that the suit gave her very little support where she needed it the most.
Her breasts bounced wildly as she walked the aisles. I just knew that at any
moment one of her nipples was going to pop out into view from underneath those
little triangles of material. From behind, her butt cheeks jiggled so
indecently that people couldn&#8217;t help but have their attention drawn to her
backside which, because of the thin strap of the thong that was buried between
her cheeks, looked like she wasn&#8217;t wearing a thing! People in the store didn&#8217;t
quite seem to know what to make of her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was clear to me that she was scared to death as she approached each customer.
I&#8217;m sure she must have been apprehensive about the reactions she might get each
time she handed out the advertisement to a potential customer. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It didn&#8217;t take long before she had approached
the few customers inside the store. She then attempted to look busy walking
among the racks of clothing - ostensibly looking for people to give the fliers
to but in reality she was just using the clothing racks to conceal her exposure
whenever possible. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t just hang about in here,&#8221; the salesgirl
called out from the checkout counter at the front of the store. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
help draw people into my shop, does it? Be sure and work the area in the mall
just outside our entrance, that way people might be tempted to come inside and
look around. They can&#8217;t buy anything if they aren&#8217;t IN the store, right?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna shook her head ever so slightly, obviously
trying to decide if she could do such a thing. She had way more courage than I
would have had if I were in her shoes as she eventually marched right out into
the open mall and silently handed out the fliers to the shoppers passing by.
From where I was sitting I could still see everything. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">In the fluorescent lights of the main corridors
of the mall it really DID look like she was completely naked! Many, many
passersby gave her double takes, especially the ones that were too far away to
take a pamphlet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Suddenly, I realized that I was giggling ever so
quietly to myself. I realized that I was actually enjoying her humiliation.
Before she had actually gone through with it, I was feeling sorry for her. Now,
actually SEEING her among the throngs of people dressed in that skimpy swimming
costume, I was relishing her embarrassment. I found that I was beginning to
understand why Donna had put me through all my trials &#8211; she enjoyed it! Now
that the situations were reversed I was enjoying it to! Deep down my conscience
was trying to tell me that it was wrong to feel this way as she only put
herself into this horrible predicament to help me. She didn&#8217;t have to do that.
It was an act of pure friendship after all. Yet despite that sentiment, a
little voice from somewhere in my brain was telling me to ignore that Polly
Anna-like sentiment and Carpe Deum!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I found myself getting even more aroused than I
already had been when I saw those six classmates of ours, the ones that had
tortured me in the food court earlier, walking up the mall corridor heading
right for Donna!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When one of the boys
snuck up on her and pinched her on the right butt cheek causing her to squeal I
almost had an orgasm right then and there! Damn, I was having fun watching her
public disgrace!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was practically giddy
watching the huge smiles on their faces as they stood there talking with Donna.
Though I couldn&#8217;t hear what was being said, I imagined what wicked things they
might have been taunting her with. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Having just experienced some of the same sort of
embarrassment in front of my peers myself I had a pretty good idea of the
mixture of emotions that Donna must have been feeling. Even though I was now
safely clothed in this modest beach cover-up garment, I was vicariously
reliving my experiences watching Donna. Again, I know I should have been
feeling bad for her but I wasn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
found myself wishing other horrible and shameful things might happen to her
like some lady giving her the &#8220;what-for&#8221; because she was teasing her husband
dressed like she was, or something equally as degrading. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I was now laughing out loud at her predicament
when suddenly I heard Eddie saying, &#8220;What are you laughing about?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh, Eddie, you startled me! I didn&#8217;t know you
were in the store.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sorry about that. So . . . what&#8217;s so funny?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Donna! Didn&#8217;t you see her out there? The store
manager is forcing her to walk around practically naked in that silly swimming
outfit so she can earn enough money to pay for this cover-up for me. Isn&#8217;t that
a gas? She embarrassed the hell out of me all day and now she&#8217;s paying the
price by having some bitch forcing her to do practically the same thing she did
to me! Pay backs are hell, aren&#8217;t they? &#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Store manager? You mean that girl over there?&#8221;
Eddie asked pointing to the salesgirl.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s her. She must have felt sorry for
me or something to make Donna do that.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie just shook his head in disbelief. &#8220;You
dope, that&#8217;s Donna&#8217;s older sister.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, they&#8217;re always doing stuff like this,
though I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve never seen her do it at her job though.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand. They&#8217;re always doing . .
.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>what?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You really have no idea do you? Donna gets off
on this kinky stuff. She always has. Her sister likes making her do things to
embarrass her younger sibling and Donna likes having her do it. Where have you
been all this time, hiding under a rock or something?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re just putting me on. Donna doesn&#8217;t have
an older sister.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure she does. She was away at college for some
time and has lived in Rockford for years, maybe that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve never met her
but trust me, that&#8217;s Donna&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I couldn&#8217;t believe it. &#8220;Did you know that
Donna&#8217;s sister worked here? Is THAT why we came to the mall today?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I really had no idea until just this moment.
Still, when those two get together there&#8217;s no telling what they&#8217;ll come up
with. &#8220;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And they do this sort of thing all the time?
Seriously?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie looked at the floor and stalled for a
moment before answering, &#8220;Well, to be honest I&#8217;ve never personally seen her do
anything this drastic but the rumors are rampant around school. Some of the
guys though have seen her being made to skinny-dip at the beach after her
sister took her suit. Oh yeah, there was that towel incident in the gym a few
months ago too.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I was stunned. I couldn&#8217;t get my little brain to
wrap itself around what I had just been told.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I KNEW something didn&#8217;t seem quite right back when Donna agreed to work
for that girl but I just couldn&#8217;t put my finger on what it was. Still, this was
all too weird. Surely he was just making this all up, wasn&#8217;t he? Perhaps my
mind was still in that pill-induced fog and I wasn&#8217;t thinking clearly. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The idea though of maybe finding another friend
to share my secret fantasies with was very appealing. I wondered if she liked
horses. Perhaps we could go riding topless sometime after I got better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deep down I guess I was hoping that Eddie was
telling the truth. There was no denying that Donna was indeed outside in the
mall embarrassing herself in front of all those strangers. There had to be SOME
explanation.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After staying with me and watching the show
Donna was putting on, Eddie eventually left to find the others as it was
getting late. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All too soon Donna&#8217;s time had expired and the
salesgirl called her back inside the store and complimented her on doing such a
fine job. She said that her afternoon sales receipts were way up thanks to the
extra publicity that my friend had provided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Donna&#8217;s face was blushing yet there was a twinkle in her eyes and it
wasn&#8217;t because of the praise she had just received! There was no denying what
she was feeling. I knew exactly. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My thoughts were interrupted when the salesgirl
said &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve earned that cover-up for your friend here. Thanks again.&#8221;
Donna wasted no time and scurried into the dressing room to change.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wanted to confront them both telling them that
they could stop the charade as I KNEW what was going on but part of me wanted
find the right words first and I needed them both to be together in case what
Eddie had told me wasn&#8217;t a lie. I needed to see their reactions simultaneously
when I spilled the beans. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I never got the chance. Donna came running out
of the dressing room angry as all get out shouting, &#8220;WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Right in the dressing room where you left
them.&#8221; The salesgirl said matter-of-factly. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;THEY&#8217;RE NOT THERE! What did you do with them?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t DO anything with them,&#8221; the girl
answered flippantly.&#8221; Are you sure you&#8217;re looking in the right dressing room.

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Calm down. They must be around here somewhere.
Perhaps your friend here took them,&#8221; she said nonchalantly pointing at me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ME?! I can&#8217;t even walk by myself. How could I
have taken them?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The two girls searched everywhere &#8211; the dressing
areas, the front desk, and even checked the clothing racks in case some
customers might have mistaken them for store merchandise and returned them to
the racks - but the search came up empty handed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What could have happened to them?&#8221; Donna asked
with her voice cracking with fright. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wear this bikini on the bus!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The salesgirl&#8217;s expression turned serious.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, you can&#8217;t. You haven&#8217;t paid for that yet. You&#8217;ve only earned
enough to pay for that cover-up ole cripple girl here is wearing.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna&#8217;s jaw dropped almost to the floor. If that
was really Donna&#8217;s sister they BOTH were doing an incredible acting job &#8211;
academy award winning in fact. I began to doubt Eddie&#8217;s story completely. Then
a thought flashed into my head.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;EDDIE!&#8221; I exclaimed loudly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;HUH? Eddie? Where? I don&#8217;t see him anywhere,&#8221;
Donna said looking around the store.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Eddie! HE must have taken your clothes!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Eddie . . . he was here not more than 15
minutes ago. He stood next to me and kept me company as we both watched you
through the store window. HE must have taken them,&#8221; I explained.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill him,&#8221; Donna said angrily as her eyes
got small and beady-looking.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;He also said the two of you were sisters,&#8221; I
added carefully.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The salesgirl looked at Donna, laughed and said
sarcastically, &#8220;Ah, that would be a big fat NO!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She&#8217;s not my sister,&#8221; Donna added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
even know the girl and besides I don&#8217;t have a sister. Oh, he&#8217;s like so dead.
When I get my hands on him, he&#8217;ll regret the day he was born.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Walking with determination Donna started for the
door. &#8220;Hey, where do you think you&#8217;re going?&#8221; the salesgirl called out.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;To find that bastard and throttle the hell out
of him and get my clothes back.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Not with my merchandise, you don&#8217;t. Not unless
you want to get arrested for shoplifting.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What the hell am I supposed to do? We&#8217;re
running out of time here and our bus will be here soon. If we miss that bus
we&#8217;ll be stuck here!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The salesgirl, hurrying to the front counter to
take care of a customer, called out over her shoulder, &#8220;Not my problem,&#8221; she
said indifferently. &#8220;You guys work it out. I&#8217;ve got a company to run and in
case you haven&#8217;t noticed we&#8217;re rather busy at the moment.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna plopped her butt down on the bench next to
me and sighed. &#8220;Now what are we going to do? There isn&#8217;t time for me to earn
enough money to buy anything else.&#8221; She then put her head into her hands and
lowered her head to her lap in frustration.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I just looked at her for several moments. I knew
what I had to do. It was the only logical solution. &#8220;Donna, why don&#8217;t you take
this gown and go and look for Eddie? You can come back and give it to me after
you get your own stuff back.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are YOU going to do while I&#8217;m gone?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine. Just help me into one of these
dressing cubicles and I&#8217;ll give you the cover-up and then I&#8217;ll hide in there
until you return.&#8221; Donna got a blank stare on her face as if she wasn&#8217;t sure
this was a good idea so I added, &#8220;What other choice do we have? And I darn sure
don&#8217;t want to miss that bus so stop stalling and help me up!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay,&#8221; she said as she reached out to help me
to my feet. It took a little doing but she managed to get me inside an empty
room and reluctantly took my gown and put it on leaving me naked once again. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I promise I&#8217;ll be back as quick as I can. Don&#8217;t
you worry one little bit; I&#8217;ll find Eddie and get my stuff back in no time at
all. You&#8217;ll see.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wasn&#8217;t sure if she was trying to convince me
or herself with her reassuring words. In any case she left leaving me sitting
on the changing room bench.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Time passed slowly. I didn&#8217;t have a watch nor
could I see a clock so I really had no idea of how much time we had before the
last bus to my village was set to arrive. The longer Donna took the more
concerned I got. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Suddenly there was a jiggling of the door
handle. &#8220;It&#8217;s occupied,&#8221; I said trying to sound calm. Whoever it was apparently
had moved on to another cubicle. After a few more moments someone else was
trying to turn the door knob. &#8220;It&#8217;s occupied&#8221; I said again to the sound of a
disgusted sigh from whoever it was outside the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">More time passed and my panic level had
increased exponentially. I was about to lose it when there was a forceful knock
on the door. &#8220;It&#8217;s occupied&#8221; I said repeating my now proven routine. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on in there? You&#8217;ve been in there
an awfully long time,&#8221; said a familiar voice from outside the door. It was that
saleslady!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute.&#8221; I replied with my
voice trembling. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are you okay or are you up to something no
good?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; I replied with my voice cracking
even more than before. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I know that voice,&#8221; the saleslady said. Just
then I heard what sounded like a key being inserted into the lock of the door
handle. In a jiffy the door flew open and there I was sitting naked on the
bench staring into the faces of a mother, her teenage daughter and the
short-tempered sales person. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh my,&#8221; the mother said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I can see
you&#8217;re hurt.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Taking a page out of Donna&#8217;s survival book I
quickly added, &#8220;It takes me much longer than normal to change because I&#8217;m a bit
handicapped.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No problem,&#8221; the lady said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll do some more
shopping and come back a little later.&#8221; With that the mother and daughter left
with their garments. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The manager looked at me with a sly grin.
&#8220;Nicely played, I&#8217;ll grant you that. So what in the hell are you doing in here?
You do realize I&#8217;ve got a business to run. You can&#8217;t stay in here all night you
know.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;My friend went to find her clothes wearing my
cover-up,&#8221; I said then quickly added before she could say anything, &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
steal it &#8211; you said she earned it so it&#8217;s hers to take, right?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Fine . . . But I want you out of here in FIVE
minutes or I&#8217;m dragging you out so my customers can try on their selections and
I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re naked or not, in FIVE minutes you&#8217;re out of here. Got

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I sat there a feeling of doom came over me.
What if she never comes back? What if we missed the bus? How will we get home?
The more I thought the more anxious I became. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Suddenly I heard Donna calling out my name. &#8220;I&#8217;m
in here,&#8221; I replied. Thank goodness she&#8217;s back, I thought to myself. Now I can
get my cover-up back and we can get the heck out of Dodge City as they say in those
old Western&#8217;s.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Donna opened the door and the look on her face
said it all. Well that and the fact that she was still wearing my beach
cover-up garment. &#8220;What happened?&#8221; I asked almost too afraid to hear what she
had to say. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you find Eddie?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Donna shook her head. &#8220;It&#8217;s worse than that. The
others said they saw him leaving the mall with Fred Nicholson from school. He
apparently drove to the mall today and Eddie told the guys that he was going
home with Fred. They didn&#8217;t see him carrying anything but they couldn&#8217;t be
sure. One thing is certain, though, Eddie is gone and the others have no idea
where my clothes are.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well . . . maybe we could explain things to the
Dragon-lady and maybe she&#8217;ll have a change of heart and give us something else
to wear. After all her sales shot up because of what you did so I think she
owes you something, right?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No dice, &#8220;Donna said with a sigh. &#8220;I already
tried that. All she said was that it wasn&#8217;t her problem and . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And what?&#8221;<br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And . . . she wants you out of the dressing
room now or she&#8217;s going to have security drag you out.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are we going to do?!&#8221; I asked in a panic.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Hanna. I never should have agreed
to us taking you to the mall. I thought it would be fun. I had no idea things
would work out this way. Sure, things got a little risqué but it was all in
fun.&#8221; Donna then began taking off the gown. &#8220;Here, take this if anyone has to
go out there naked it will be me. You&#8217;ve gone through enough today.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I may live to regret this,&#8221; I said waving off
the gown with my arms, &#8220;But I think I stand better chance than you do. After
all, I&#8217;m the crippled one. People will have more sympathy for me than they
would for you. If things go bad just say I&#8217;m a little out of my head because of
the pain pills I&#8217;m taking. At least that sounds plausible. Now get me in my
wheelbarrow before we miss the bus or the Dragon-lady calls security.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Donna didn&#8217;t argue. In fact I was sure she
sighed in relief! She tossed on the gown and ran to get the Wheelbarrow. In no
time I was sitting in that stupid contraption covering my chest as best as
possible with that small pillow, holding my legs together as tightly as I
could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Donna bolted through the store yelling, &#8220;Bye!&#8221;
to the Dragon-lady. We literally flew through the mall corridor and out the
main entrance to the mall. I could see the bus cue still waiting at the bus
stop sign. At least it hasn&#8217;t left yet, I thought.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Even though she was half out of breath from
trying to push me across the parking lot asphalt she managed to ask, &#8220;You do
realize that you&#8217;ll probably end up exposing more than your butt trying to get
on the bus don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I didn&#8217;t answer her. I didn&#8217;t want to think
about it. That very thought was overwhelming in my present state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we were about 40 yards from the bus stop
I saw the bus pull up to the sign and open its doors. People were getting on.
&#8220;HURRY, DONNA!&#8221; I yelled, &#8220;BEFORE IT LEAVES US!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Everyone had boarded the bus by the time we got
there. The same bus driver looked out and saw us coming and got off the bus. At
least he wasn&#8217;t going to leave us stranded! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said looking me over. &#8220;You seemed to
have lost something, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story,&#8221; Donna said. &#8220;It&#8217;s her pain
pills. She&#8217;s a little loopy. I&#8217;ll watch out for her. Please just don&#8217;t leave
us, mister. We have to get back.&#8221;<br style="">

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The driver smiled a knowing smile. &#8220;I
understand. I was the same way after my surgery. People told me I said and did
the craziest things that I don&#8217;t even remember. Come on, I&#8217;ll help you get her
on board.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">With that he moved my pillow and was clearly
shocked to see that I was now completely naked. He didn&#8217;t say anything but got
the wheelbarrow directly to the door of the bus. He grabbed one arm and Donna
grabbed the other and stood me up in preparation for getting me up the steps
and onto the bus. I knew that now my naked body was clearly visible to the
passengers nearest the door so I dared not look up.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna?&#8221; I heard a familiar voice say. &#8220;HANNA?
WHAT ON EARTH?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I looked up and saw my math teacher, Mr. Jenkins
&#8211; the one I have such a crush on! He was sitting in the very first seat looking
right at my naked body!! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna,&#8221; I heard again and felt my body shaking.
&#8220;HANNA, get up!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What . . . HUH? What the . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna, get up&#8221; I heard my mother saying. &#8220;You
have a visitor.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My mother? What? I opened my eyes to see that I
was in my room. I had no idea how had gotten home. My first thought was that I
had fainted. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry mom . . . I . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">It was then I realized that the casts on my
wrists and legs were gone! I could move my fingers. I was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . normal!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How long had I been out I wondered. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That must have been some dream you were
having,&#8221; my mother said as she wiped the hair away from my face. You were
thrashing about and crying &#8216;NO PLEASE!&#8217; over and over again.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I looked around the room I saw that
everything was just as it should be. The whole thing was a dream?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It couldn&#8217;t have been!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so real!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Mom . . . I dreamt that I had two broken wrists
and a broken leg and . . .&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It was just a nightmare, sweetheart, that&#8217;s
all, just a nightmare. Now get up. Your friend Donna is here to see you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I looked at the door to my room and there stood
Donna standing there in a white beach cover-up outfit just like the one in my
dream! She was smiling at me with such a weird smile!</span>
