<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Synopsis:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A young girl&#8217;s unfortunate accident leads to some very
embarrassing
pubic exposure.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I&#8217;ve
always loved horses. Ever since I was a
little girl I spent every moment thinking about them, taking care of
them or on
a rare occasion enjoying a day on horseback courtesy of a kindly
neighbor. I
couldn&#8217;t wait until I had a horse of my own. Though I lived in the
country near
the beach, my dream was just that - only a dream and I had to content
myself
with admiring those graceful creatures from afar. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
I turned 16 my wish finally came true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A gentleman who often let me ride one of his
horses gave a young mare to me as a gift since he could no longer keep
it. I
was ecstatic!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">We
bonded instantly. Every chance I had I was
riding that horse! I got so good at it that many times I never even
used a
saddle. I just hopped on and off we went. I named her Angel as she was
always
watching out for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
it was the
beginning of summer I had plenty of time to devote to exploring the
off-the-beaten path trails and back roads of my little community with
my new
best four-legged friend. Occasionally, even though it was forbidden, I
would
even ride her on the beach early in the morning or late in the evening
when
there weren&#8217;t many people around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
never got in trouble and I dearly loved the smell of the ocean and the
salt in
my hair as I rode along at the water&#8217;s edge. Angel seemed to love it
too as she
was always more lively at the beach and always seemed to somehow sense
that&#8217;s
where we were heading even before we got anywhere close to it. I was
having the
time of my life.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">One
day I was riding in the woods when I spotted
Katrina, a girl in my class. She was also on a horse just walking along
some
distance ahead of me, oblivious to the fact that I was behind her. I
thought
about quietly turning Angel around and sneaking off before she spotted
me as
she wasn&#8217;t a very nice person at school. She was one of the popular
girls whose
family had money and power in my small village. At school I did my best
to
avoid her because it wasn&#8217;t wise to get on her bad side. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I sat there thinking about what to do, she
saw me and turned her horse around and trotted towards me. &#8220;Hey Hanna!
I didn&#8217;t
know you had a horse.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
she&#8217;s ALL mine. Her name is Angel,&#8221; I
replied with pride as I patted my horse&#8217;s neck lovingly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
prepared myself for some condescending remark
that I was sure was coming when Katrina remarked, &#8220;She&#8217;s BEAUTIFUL!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I wouldn&#8217;t give to
have a horse like
that.&#8221; I swelled up with satisfaction as she spoke those words. She
then added,
&#8220;Would you like to ride along with me for a while? It&#8217;s a little boring
riding
alone.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To
say that I was shocked would be an
understatement. She was actually being NICE to me! I agreed to her
request and
we rode along side-by-side on our horses in the woods chatting about,
school;
the latest hair-styles; all things having to do with horses and of
course,
boys! This was a side of her I had ever seen before. I figured the fact
that we
were both horse-lovers made her see me in a different light. I suppose
the fact
that I had a horse of my own, in her eyes at least, made me acceptable.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
usually still rode by myself but over the next
few weeks we occasionally met up to ride together. I looked forward to
these
outings and felt like a true friendship was growing between us. Of
course we
were still competitive as girls often are and sometimes we raced each
other to
see who had the fastest horse with the winner taking bragging rights
for that
day. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">On
hot days I would ride without a saddle wearing
only my bikini and on particularly nice days when I was alone in a
secluded
area I would take off my top to work on my tan as I rode along, not
that I was
particularly well-endowed, in fact just the opposite, but I hated tan
lines. I
never spotted anyone and got a bit braver as time went on sometimes
even
hanging my top on a tree branch and picking it up on my way back home
so that I
wouldn&#8217;t have to constantly hold onto it. Okay, I&#8217;ll admit that wasn&#8217;t
the real
reason I did it. I just liked the excitement and thrill of being
topless so far
away from my clothing. It was harmless fun and like I said I never ran
into
anyone in all the times I did it. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
was on one of those days that the unthinkable
happened. I was riding long topless having left my bikini top on a
branch
several miles back when I saw a bunch of tree logs stacked on top of
each other
lying on the ground. Feeling pretty frisky after riding along wearing
so little
I decided to try and see if Angel could jump that pile. I urged her on
and she
took off like a flash. It was breathtaking galloping along towards that
pile. I
leaned forward grasping her mane and practically urging her into the
air over
the obstacle before her. SHE DID IT! She jumped that pile like a pro. I
screamed with joy as we briefly sailed through the air . . . then we
landed. I
wasn&#8217;t prepared for the sudden impact of the ground as it rose up to
meet us.
The jar made me lose my balance and over her neck I went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t remember hitting
the ground but I do
remember eventually looking up at my horse as she stood over me
wondering what
had happened and why I was on the ground and not on her back. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s
okay, girl. It was my fault for trying
this without a saddle. I&#8217;m not mad at you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My horse looked relieved at hearing my words though I knew
darn well she
didn&#8217;t understand a bit of what I was saying.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">They
say when you fall off a horse you need to
get right back on again so that&#8217;s what I tried to do. I casually moved
my leg
to try to stand and the most excruciating pain shot all through me. My
leg! To
my horror it was extremely painful at the lower calf and starting to
swell. I
just knew that I had broken my left lower leg! I fell backward onto the
dirt
and waited for the pain to subside. I instinctively reached down to rub
it as
if that would somehow cure my injury when I got another shock &#8211; my
wrists &#8211; I
couldn&#8217;t move either of my wrists or my fingers!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had I broken them too, I wondered to myself
in a panic! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was trapped, miles from home and I couldn&#8217;t
walk or even get up on my horse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately my injuries didn&#8217;t really hurt all that bad
unless I tried
to move them or put weight on them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
called out for help but no one was around to hear my cries. I cursed
myself for
being so stupid! A million thoughts ran through my head as to what I
needed to
do.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
as I was beginning to freak out, I saw
Katrina riding her horse on the trail in the distance! I repeatedly
shouted out
to her and she finally saw me and hurried over to where I was laying on
the
ground! &#8220;What the hell happened, Hanna? Are you okay?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
think I broke my leg and maybe my wrists. I
can&#8217;t walk or move my fingers. There&#8217;s no way I can climb on my horse.
I need
help.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s
a good thing I came along when I did.&#8221;
Katrina said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about a thing - I know just what to do.
Can you
stand on your good leg?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
I think so.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katrina
then helped me to my feet. Since my
horse was bareback and hers had a saddle, she supported me as she led
me around
to the other side of her horse and told me to put my good right foot
into her
stirrup and try to hoist myself up. She then pushed on my butt with
both of her
hands as I did so until I was able to swing up into her saddle draping
my
injured left leg off to the side. It hurt but only for a moment.
Without her
help I never would have made it. Katrina then took hold of the reins of
my
horse and led both horses along as she walked out in front. I couldn&#8217;t
help but
think what a good friend she was and how much I needed her right at
that
moment. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
we walked along a chilling feeling crept up
my spine. &#8220;HEY! We&#8217;re going the wrong way! My top . . . I mean . . . my
HOME is
THAT way,&#8221; I said making my best attempt to point over my shoulder to
the trail
behind us.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;True,&#8221;
Katrina said, &#8220;But I can&#8217;t walk all that
way &#8211; it&#8217;s several miles to your house. The town is just up ahead and
so is Doc
Johnson&#8217;s office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
need to get
attention right away.&#8221; Katrina just kept on walking as if she was
determined to
take charge of the situation and see to it that I was taken care of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t fault her for
that but . . . I was
TOPLESS!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Katrina!!
I can&#8217;t go into town like this!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
friend gave me a disappointed scowl. &#8220;Look,
what&#8217;s more important here, your health or your modesty? Get a grip
will you.
This is serious, ya know.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then I heard the unmistakable noise of the
town growing ever closer as we walked along &#8211; the sounds of cars along
the
roadway, the prattling of people carrying on conversations, and the
occasional
racket of machinery from the stores that lined the village. I couldn&#8217;t
believe
this was happening. I was about to ride right through town wearing only
a tiny
string bikini bottom, baring my small but oh so very private breasts to
anyone
who wanted to look. I couldn&#8217;t bear it! What would they think?</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;KATRINA!&#8221;
I shouted in a panic as we rounded
the bend in the trail and the town&#8217;s main street came into view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just looked back at
me, smiled and kept
on walking. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
friend tugged harder at her horse&#8217;s reins as
if to impel her on into the unfamiliar bustling of Main Street. Our
village
isn&#8217;t really that large &#8211; only 6 occupied streets really, but it is the
center
of activity for most of the people that lived for miles and miles. The
shops
were always busy even during the week and here I was riding on a horse
exposing
my bare boobs as if I was just a little kid! I think I made more of a
spectacle
of myself as I desperately tried raising my arms to cover my chest
which I
wasn&#8217;t able to do every well with the swaying of the horse as we walked
along.
My actions only drew attention to the fact that I was topless! It&#8217;s not
unusual
to see children and even the occasional teenager wearing bathing suits
in town
on a summer&#8217;s day but TOPLESS, well, that&#8217;s another story!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">People
stopped dead in their tracks as they took
in the sight ambling down Main Street. Cars slowed and people pointed.
I could
hear people giggling in the distance and a few things like, &#8220;Oh, the
poor dear&#8221;
as some of the more discerning people spotted my swollen left leg.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
more I tried to press my arms against my
chest to hide myself, the more my wrists and fingers hurt. Holding them
up in
the air made them throb. The only way I seemed to get relief was to
lower them
to my sides, which I was forced to do several times just ease the pain
&#8211; but
then I was revealing everything!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn&#8217;t
very well get off the horse and I knew in my own mind that I needed
help. I
just didn&#8217;t understand why I couldn&#8217;t have gone home and gotten dressed
first.
Then I looked at Katrina who was obviously working up quite a sweat
plodding
along on the ground in this heat all for my benefit. I just couldn&#8217;t
say
anything to hurt her feelings. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">So
off we walked, slowly as horses naturally do,
making our way along past the various shops and side streets until we
came to
Doc Johnson&#8217;s place. His office wasn&#8217;t really anything more than an old
shop
along a row of shops that lined the road that had been converted into
his small
but fairly well-equipped clinic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was
the only physician in the area so pretty much everyone came to him when
they
needed help. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">With
the horses standing next to the sidewalk
Katrina began the process of trying to figure out how to get me down.
Getting
off the horse, even with her guidance, was much harder than getting on.
Several
times I just knew I was going to fall off and shrieked with fear. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Several
men came over and offered their
assistance. One fellow grabbed me from behind around my abdomen and
lifted me
off the saddle as another supported my hind end. Feeling his hands on
my
lightly-clad butt sent shivers up my spine. As they got me off the
horse and
tried lowering me gently to the ground I began to slip from the grasp
of the
man that was holding me in the air around my waist resulting in his
hands
cupping the underside of my breasts. He dared not let go until I was
safely on
the ground. Even though it was an innocent action, he apologized
profusely as
he struggled to get me down, which only made it all the more
embarrassing for
me. The scene was almost like the Keystone Cops pretending to be

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katrina
grabbed me and supported me as I hobbled
into the doctor&#8217;s office as I heard one of the men saying he would look
after
our horses for us while we were inside. Naturally the waiting room was
full of
people and they all stopped talking and blatantly stared at me as my
friend helped
me into the only vacant seat next to a young teenaged boy whose eyes
were as
big as quarters as he checked out my state of undress. &#8220;What happened?&#8221;
he
asked almost out of breath.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What
does it look like happened, Sherlock. I
broke my damn leg!&#8221; I snapped flippantly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;There&#8217;s
no need to get all arrogant young
lady.&#8221; A woman remarked sitting next to the boy that I took to be his
mother.
&#8220;He was only curious.&#8221; I apologized and raised my arms to try and
shield myself
from prying eyes as I waited for my friend to describe to the
receptionist my
problem. Katrina was only too happy to explain what had happened in all
the
gory detail to anyone who was the least bit interested. I was certainly
an
object of immense curiosity to all those present.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But,
why is she only wearing a bikini bottom?
One elderly woman asked.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
don&#8217;t know,&#8221; my friend answered much to my
chagrin. &#8220;She was like that when I found her on the trail.&#8221; Her comment
elicited a &#8220;tsk,&#8221; from the old lady clearly acknowledging her
disapproval. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
sat there blushing for a good 20 minutes as
people came and went. It wasn&#8217;t so much the comments that made this so
humiliating for me, as it was the silent expressions on everyone&#8217;s face
as they
spotted my condition. Some grinned at their good fortune, others
frowned and
still others looked darn-right thrilled at the prospect of seeing
something
they weren&#8217;t supposed to see! If I actually HAD something to be proud
of up top
I might not have felt so embarrassed. I could only imagine what they
were thinking
as they noticed my tits as I repeatedly had to lower my arms to stop
the
throbbing sensation in my wrists before I could cover myself up again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever I did lower my
arms away from my
chest, all conversation ceased as people looked up to see what was
going on.
The women were the worst. They kept giving me that knowing grin like
they were
onto my little secret, whatever that was supposed to be. I sat there
mortified
until an assistant came out and called my name. I was never so glad to
get out
of the limelight as I was right then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
much time had passed in the examining room
and several x-rays later the good doctor informed me that my leg was
only
fractured, not broken and that I would need a cast to keep it from
getting
worse and allow it to heal. He then proceeded to put it in a cast that
extended
from just below my knee to almost half covering my left foot. My wrists
each
had a couple of small round bones that were dislocated and he managed
to reset
them into proper position. He put casts on both wrists to keep things
in place.
Those casts extended from the middle of my lower forearms and covered
most of
my fingers. The result was that I wasn&#8217;t able to move my fingers hardly
at all,
which he said was the point as finger movement resulted in subtle wrist
movement which he wanted to avoid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly after he had numbed things up nothing really
hurt. The
relief was wonderful. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">No
sooner had he finished than my mother rushed
in. The office had called her and explained what had happened. The fact
that I
must have looked so pitiful sporting three casts was probably the only
reason
she didn&#8217;t flip out over the fact that I was wearing only a string
bikini
bottom. She had no idea that I liked to ride wearing my swimsuit and
she
CERTAINLY <b style="">never</b> would have approved
of me riding topless! She didn&#8217;t ask about my lack of clothing and I
didn&#8217;t
volunteer anything either. I knew, however, that sooner or later I was
going to
have to answer for this. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom helped me back out into the still packed
waiting room. I had to hobble along among the dozens of people who had
their
wait prolonged because of my accident. At least some of the people that
had
given me disapproving looks before I went back to see the doctor
because of the
way I was dressed were now sporting looks of empathy as they saw my
three
casts. I felt a bit vindicated that I wasn&#8217;t the slut that they had
thought I
was. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once
out the door I had expected my mom to help
me into her car but we turned and headed down the busy sidewalk
allowing still
MORE people to see my naked chest. &#8220;Where are we going,&#8221; I asked in a
panic!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Doc
gave me some prescriptions that I need to
get filled before going home,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;It won&#8217;t take a minute.&#8221;
With that
we continued down the sidewalk past another few shops before reaching
the
pharmacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just like
that my mom opened
the door and in we walked &#8211; such a public place to be wearing only a
tiny bikini
bottom! We made our way to the back of the store and, after finding me
a place
to sit, she gave the prescriptions to the pharmacist to be filled. I
was afraid
my mother was going to sit next to me while we waited and read me the
riot act
about what had happened, which would have been more than I could have
handled
at that moment. She didn&#8217;t, however. She instead said she was going to
look
around the store and get a few things that she needed while we were
here. She
left me there sitting in my chair, once again on display to all the
gawkers.
They didn&#8217;t fool me with all their talk of trying to sound concerned.
They only
wanted to get closer and check out the half-naked girl &#8211; at least
that&#8217;s the
way it seemed to me. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally,
my prescriptions were ready and we left
the store. Getting into my mother&#8217;s car was almost a bigger ordeal than
getting
off Katrina&#8217;s horse! Once again I had to have help, as I was not used
to the
cast on my legs and my hands were all but useless. Do you have any idea
what
it&#8217;s like to be touched on your bare skin by strangers &#8211; albeit
well-meaning
strangers?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People I
didn&#8217;t know were
wrapping their arms around me, clumsily scooting my butt back onto the
car seat
causing my bottoms to slip lower and lower until my ass was barely
covered or
having them hold my legs and lifting them into the car. I must have
looked a
sight! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Upon
arriving home my mom ushered me into my
bedroom, gave me one of the pills the doctor ordered for me and then
started
untying the stings on my bikini bottom. Not even my mother had seen me
completely naked in years! &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; I asked in a panic as
the
first string fell away from my body.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You
can&#8217;t get into bed with this dirty thing.
Those are clean sheets. I know you want to be able to do for yourself
but you
certainly can&#8217;t untie these by yourself, can you?</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No,
ma&#8217;am&#8221; I sighed in defeat as the last of my
covering fell to the floor. My mom, being a curious mother, lingered
her gaze
at my nether region longer than she should have &#8211; I supposed to check
out how
her only daughter had grown these last few years. It was truly
embarrassing let
me tell you. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
helped me into bed and perhaps because of
the pain pill, it wasn&#8217;t long before I fell fast asleep. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I&#8217;m
not sure how long I slept but when I awoke I
felt a chill. I looked down and discovered that I was naked on top of
the bed
sheet. Apparently I had kicked off the covers with my heavy casts as I
tossed
and turned during my nap.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
was then my heart stopped. &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re
finally awake. Are you feeling okay?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
immediately snapped my head towards the
direction of the voice and was shocked to find FOUR OF MY CLASSMATES in
the
room &#8211; Donna, Debbie, Billy and Eddie!!! I looked down to see if I
could find
my covers but they were on the floor. I also saw that my legs were
spread apart
and, from where they were sitting, they could see EVERYTHING between my
legs!!</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
we&#8217;ve been here about a half an hour,&#8221; Donna
cheerfully answered. &#8220;Your mother told us we could wait in here as long
as we
didn&#8217;t disturb you or wake you up.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
swallowed hard. I could have just killed my
dear, sweet mother right then and there if she had been in the room at
the
time. &#8220;No, I mean, how long have I been . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Naked?&#8221;
asked Debbie. &#8220;Pretty much the whole
time we&#8217;ve been in here.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Why
the hell didn&#8217;t you cover me up?!&#8221; I
snapped as I quickly slammed my legs together knocking my good ankle
against my
cast on my other leg causing another sharp pain. I wouldn&#8217;t have put it
past
them to have stripped my bedcovers off the bed just to get a look at me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Because
we didn&#8217;t want to wake you up,&#8221; Eddie
said with a slight giggle trying his best to sound sincere.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah,
right . . . WOULD SOMEBODY HAND ME MY
COVERS PLEASE!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay,
Okay. Keep your pants on,&#8221; Donna said
sarcastically, &#8220;oh wait, you aren&#8217;t wearing any!&#8221; Her comment made
everyone
laugh but me. She clumsily fiddled with the covers on the floor
prolonging my
exposure until she was satisfied that she had them untangled and then
casually
tossed them over my body and walked back against the wall with the
others. The
cover sheet fell well short of my boobs landing in the middle of my
belly. I
tried grabbing at it with my fingers to pull it up, but found that I
couldn&#8217;t
get a hold of it. I couldn&#8217;t use my fingers at all. I tried using my
casts on
my wrists to slide it up but that was an exercise in futility. I grew
more
frustrated with myself by the minute and frantically worked at making
the sheet
move.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
give it a rest, will ya?&#8221; Donna said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
already seen everything you&#8217;ve got for the last half-hour. Besides,
it&#8217;s like
ninety degrees in here anyway.&#8221; The others all had smirks on their
faces as
Donna finished talking. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What
the hell do you want, anyway?&#8221; I said with
exasperation. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Nothing,
we were concerned that&#8217;s all. We came
right over when we heard about your horse accident.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Take

casual insult about my lack of endowment
wasn&#8217;t lost on me but I chose to ignore it. If she thought that I was
the least
little bit sensitive about my chest she would show no mercy at
tormenting
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh thank

sure did,&#8221; added Billy. &#8220;She said she was
glad that you had such good friends that cared about you and that she
could
rely on.&#8221;</span>

ole mom, I thought to myself. Friends that
she could rely on indeed! If she only knew what kind of people these
teens were
she would never have said that!</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Could
you guys just leave? I&#8217;m not exactly
dressed for company right now. Besides I need my rest.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
how cute,&#8221; Donna said mockingly. &#8220;NOW she&#8217;s
all modest. Listen sister. Katrina told us all about how you were
riding your
horse topless through the woods before you had your little accident.
Why anyone
would want to show those little things off is beyond me but in any case
that&#8217;s
your business. You&#8217;re not fooling us. I&#8217;ll bet you were fingering
yourself out
there when you fell off your horse. Was that what happened? You lost
your
balanced during a climatic orgasm?&#8221;</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;SHUT
UP!&#8221; I snapped totally mortified at what
she had just said. &#8220;I was not! My horse threw me if you must know.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Then
what happened to your top?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It
. . . well . . . it must have fallen off
when I hit the ground.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Everyone
laughed hysterically. &#8216;SURE it did,&#8221;
Donna mocked, &#8220;and I suppose you couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere after the
accident
either.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
. . . that&#8217;s not what . . . oh, just put a
sock in it will ya!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8221;Don&#8217;t
worry,&#8221; Donna said patronizing me, &#8220;your
secret is safe with us.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then my mother walked into the room and
cheerfully said. &#8220;Look who&#8217;s finally up.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Mom,
I&#8217;m trying to get some rest here. Why did
you let these morons in here, anyway?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s
not a very nice way to refer to your
friends.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;FRIENDS?!&#8221;
These aren&#8217;t my friends. Have you
lost your mind?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure
they are. They&#8217;re quite concerned about
you and volunteered to help in any way that they could which is really
a relief
as I wasn&#8217;t sure how I was going to manage. I can&#8217;t miss any more work
and I
certainly don&#8217;t want to leave you here alone with three casts like you
have.
What if you fell or something? Why without their help I&#8217;d be a nervous
wreck at
work.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
heart began skipping beats. &#8220;What do you mean
THEIR HELP?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We&#8217;ve
volunteered to look after you all day
while your mother is at work,&#8221; Donna said with a shit-eating grin on
her face.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take good care of you too, I promise.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">MOTHER!!
You CAN&#8217;T be serious!!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure
I am. What&#8217;s wrong with them helping? It&#8217;s
a very nice gesture if you ask me. Besides I need them. I don&#8217;t have
any
alternative.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
won&#8217;t let you do this to me, mom. You can&#8217;t .
. . you just CAN&#8217;T!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom removed her hand from behind her back and
held up my bikini top. &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll accept this situation without
any
further complaints unless you want to explain to me in front of your
friends
here why your top was found hanging on a tree branch three miles from
where you
had your accident.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
Gawd, she KNEW!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked at her and then at my classmates. I
was defeated. There was no way I was going to explain ANYTHING to her
or them.
I&#8217;d be in more trouble than I could ever get out of if I had to explain
what I
was really doing. Hell, she could even take away my horse because of
this!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
let out a sigh and replied meekly, &#8220;I see your
point mom. I&#8217;ll let them help me while you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom gave me such a warm yet insincere smile.
&#8220;You know, somehow I thought you would.&#8221;</span>
