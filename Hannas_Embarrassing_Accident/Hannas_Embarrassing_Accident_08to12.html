<b style="">Hanna&#8217;s Embarrassing Accident! </b>(reluctant
exhibitionism, self-discovery.)<br>
By <b style="">Hooked6</b> (<a href="mailto:Hooked6@hotmail.com">Hooked6@hotmail.com</a>)</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter
8</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As the girls kept a hold of me next to the
bathtub I silently pondered my situation. This was only the first day after my
accident. I could only imagine what the next several weeks would be like. My
thoughts were interrupted when I heard one of the boys in the living room
calling out &#8220;They&#8217;re in the bathroom. It&#8217;s just down that hallway there.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just great, I thought to myself, that&#8217;s just
what I need, somebody else to see me naked! Before I could protest the bathroom
door opened and in walked Katrina! She stood there looking me over and just
giggled. &#8220;You do look a sight, Hanna.&#8221; She shook her head at me as if in
disbelief as she looked directly at my body and then, trying to sound
empathetic added, &#8220;Are you in any pain?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I told her that I was coping and that the
medication the doctor prescribed helped a lot. I really didn&#8217;t want to stand
there naked trying to have a conversation but I didn&#8217;t have a much choice as I
couldn&#8217;t make my way around without help and the girls didn&#8217;t seem to want to
move despite my subtle hints. All I could do was stand there totally
embarrassed, baring my newly shaved flesh to yet another classmate. Then it
dawned on me that Katrina was the one who was looking after my horse. &#8220;How&#8217;s
Angel? Is she Okay?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ve got her in the pasture with my
horse and they seem to be having a good time together. Don&#8217;t worry about a
thing. I&#8217;ll take good care of her until you are ready to ride again. I can just
imagine that you are itching to get back out there and ride topless again,&#8221; she
added with a giggle.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Shut up!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Oh and
that reminds me. I brought you something.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You did?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, I thought you might be able to use this,&#8221;
she said as she held out a small paper sack. &#8220;My younger brother brought this
home from the hospital after he had his appendix taken out.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Realizing that I couldn&#8217;t take the package from
her and open it myself, she fumbled with the bag and pulled out what looked
like a pediatric hospital gown. &#8220;Knowing you had those casts I figured that
getting into and out of clothes might be a problem so I thought that this might
help. Here, try it on.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katrina then stepped closer and opened up the
gown and the girls helped me put my arms into the short sleeves. Like all
hospital gowns, it opened in the back but it was soft and completely covered my
nakedness. Well . . . sort of. My boobs were covered but the gown was really
VERY short. Her brother must have been quite young when he last had worn this.
The fabric was embarrassing too as it had teddy bears all over it and it only
came down to barely two inches below my crotch. It was definitely a kid&#8217;s gown.
The other thing that I was soon to discover was that the girls couldn&#8217;t close
the gown in the back either &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t big enough to wrap all the way around
me and be tied. The material hung loosely off my shoulders leaving about a 9
inch gap between the pieces of fabric thus completely exposing my rear end. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t FIT!&#8221; I complained.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Look at it this way,&#8221; Donna said snickering.
&#8220;At least you won&#8217;t have to have one of us help you get your pants off every
time you need to use the bathroom. You can just plop down and do your business
without all that fuss.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I suppose . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to admit it&#8217;s better than nothing,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Debbie added encouragingly. &#8220;Besides, what choice do we have?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; I reluctantly agreed realizing
that I was probably sounding very ungrateful. &#8220;Thank you Katrina for bringing
this over . . . and for all you did for me yesterday. I don&#8217;t know what I would
have done without you being there for me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh I wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for the WORLD,&#8221;
she replied laughing out loud. &#8220;If you could have seen your face sitting there
topless in that doctor&#8217;s office as everybody looked at your little bare
boobies! It was PRICELESS!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah? Well you try it sometime and see how YOU
like it why don&#8217;t ya?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh don&#8217;t be such a spoil sport. I&#8217;m just
messing with ya. Besides, I know you liked it.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Shut up.&#8221; I snapped, trying to hide the fact
that I was blushing. &#8220;I did not!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get her back into the living room. She&#8217;ll
be much more comfortable there.&#8221; With that the girls helped me hobble back down
the hall, my butt flashing the room as I went. As soon as I sat down I
immediately became aware that my vulva was showing. The girls had to help me by
pulling at the hem of my gown, tugging it down my thighs as far as it would go,
which wasn&#8217;t much, as I tried to lift my body off the chair. I was eventually
able to get covered, just barely, but I had to sit with my knees together &#8211; not
a comfortable thing to do with my fractured leg in a cast. There was no way
however that I was going to give the boys in the room another free look.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After a few good natured jokes about my attire
the room fell awkwardly silent. Everyone sat around looking at each other &#8211; but
mostly at me. Occasionally someone would say something or try to start a
conversation but it would soon die out. Katrina decided to leave as she had
things to do and all too soon I found myself bored to death. At least with her
in the room I could have shared our mutual interest in horses, but with her
gone I had nothing to talk about as I had little in common with these other
classmates of mine. What was all the more maddening was that all the things I
usually would have done to occupy myself on a beautiful summer&#8217;s day whenever I
was bored I couldn&#8217;t do because of my injuries. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Someone finally turned on the television to pass
the time and found a good program to watch. Just as it was getting interesting
the power went out. Everyone hoped that it would come back on again shortly but
it didn&#8217;t. No TV, no radio, no computers &#8211; nothing. &#8220;Well, that guy from the
power company DID warn us that they would be working on the power lines today.
I guess it can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; Donna said with a sigh. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">More silence. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">More boredom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I found my thoughts turning to my experiences
that morning and of all the people that had seen me naked. Never in my wildest
dreams would I have ever thought that I would be exposed to so many people
without being able to prevent it. The more I thought about it the more aroused I
became. Was Katrina right when she said I secretly LIKED the exposure? My
thinking was somewhat unclear &#8211; probably because of those darned pills! Still,
she must have been right otherwise why would I have been riding topless on my
horse? Surely it was for the thrill of it all. No one FORCED me to do that. I
did it because it was exciting. At least I THINK that&#8217;s why I did it. My mind
was still in a fog and it wasn&#8217;t even 10 o&#8217;clock in the morning yet.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The more I thought about things the wetter I got
until I was worried that I would soon embarrass myself by having someone notice
my arousal. Still . . . my heart began to race and that tingle down below kept
overtaking my thoughts. I looked at Billy as he sat across the room. He was
blindly staring out the window with his mind a thousand miles away. Clearly he
was bored as well. I had never noticed how cute he was before. In fact I had
never really paid much attention to him at all. The inner voice in my head
softly began telling me to open my legs and flash him &#8211; just to see if he&#8217;d
notice. I couldn&#8217;t believe the thoughts I was having. I COULD have done it
easily the voice in my head told me but I dared not even do such a thing. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That devilish voice grew louder and more
persuasive. I couldn&#8217;t get those thoughts out of my mind. I wanted to. I really
wanted to, in my fog-shrouded brain anyway. My palms got sweaty and my heart
pounded. It would be so easy I told myself &#8211; just open your legs a little and
see if he would notice. No matter how much that voice pleaded I just couldn&#8217;t
do it. It was wrong and I knew it. I wasn&#8217;t that kind of girl. I wasn&#8217;t cheap
nor was I a tease. I had my pride. Oh god was I ever wet! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">This argument went on inside my head for some
time. Why couldn&#8217;t I do it? I wanted to. Hell, I NEEDED to yet I just couldn&#8217;t
do it. I&#8217;d die if I did &#8211; or at least that&#8217;s how I felt. I wasn&#8217;t thinking too
clearly even still. I was ecstatic when I rode topless but that was different.
I never really expected to get caught did I? I was safe. It was all harmless
fun. And riding through town topless and being gawked at in the doctor&#8217;s office
wasn&#8217;t my fault either. It was unavoidable and I had no control over . . . what
was that . . . I had no control? But I HAVE control now. I can choose whether
to open my legs or not. It is all up to me. I&#8217;m nothing but a big fat chicken &#8211;
a wimp, a coward. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just then my mind snapped back to reality when I
heard Billy saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m bored out of my mind. There&#8217;s nothing to do and it&#8217;s
hot as hell in here with the electricity off.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hey! I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221; Donna said with a sly
grin on her face. I had a bad feeling about this. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go to Rockford! We can shop and get
something to eat at the mall and just hang out,&#8221; Donna suggested excitedly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What a great idea!&#8221; Billy replied as he jumped
out of his chair ready to head out the door. &#8220;It beats hanging out here with
nothing to do.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">At last, I thought, these morons were going to
leave me alone. I never wanted them here anyway. I knew it was only a matter of
time before they tired of watching the &#8220;poor ole invalid&#8221; and found other
things to do. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna, what do you think? Would that be okay
with you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure, sounds like fun.&#8221; I replied </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;SWEET!&#8221; Debbie cooed. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a blast! I
haven&#8217;t been in a very long time.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You all go and have a great time. I&#8217;ll be
fine.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are you talking about Hanna? You&#8217;re coming
with us.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;OH no! I&#8217;m not going. I can&#8217;t! Not like this.
Besides, how am I going to get there? None of you have a car and the only way
to Rockford is by bus and that leaves from the village which is two miles away!
I can&#8217;t hobble all that way. Don&#8217;t be silly. I&#8217;ll just stay here and take a
nap. You guys go and have a good time. I don&#8217;t mind at all, really I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My classmates all looked at each other in
silence. Finally I had won an argument with these idiots. I began to be filled
with the most wonderful feeling of satisfaction. They would leave and I&#8217;d be
free of their gawking eyes and groping hands. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8221;VE GOT IT!&#8221; Eddie said as he snapped his
fingers. &#8220;Wait here, I&#8217;ll be right back!&#8221; He then bolted out the screen door and
disappeared. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What was that all about?&#8221; Debbie asked. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Beats me, he&#8217;s your boyfriend.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna decided that it was time for another pill
and handed it to me with a glass of water which I dutifully took figuring that
it would demonstrate to them that I would be fine without them. I had eaten
breakfast, showered and now had taken my medication so there was really nothing
left for them to do.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Suddenly the peaceful room was shattered by a
slamming screen door as Eddie ran back into the room and, half-out of breath,
shouted. &#8220;Pillow, I need a pillow!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna grabbed a throw pillow off the couch and
tossed it to him. &#8220;PERFECT! Follow me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Bring Hanna. It&#8217;s all set.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s all set?&#8221; I protested but to no avail as
the girls grabbed my underarms and pulled me to my feet and hobbled me towards
the door. &#8220;WAIT! Where are we going? Just put me down!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As soon as we reached the door I saw it. Eddie
stood next to it pointing at his solution with pride. &#8220;Check it out!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s PERFECT!&#8221; Debbie screamed right in my ear.
&#8220;Eddie, you&#8217;re a genius.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Billy and I will take turns and you girls can
lead the way,&#8221; Eddie explained. &#8220;With this thing getting to the village will be
no trouble at all.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh NO! I&#8217;m not getting in that wheelbarrow.
You&#8217;re out of your mind.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be such a spoilsport, Hanna. This will
work out just fine,&#8221; Donna said as she and Debbie literally dragged me to the
front of the contraption and gently pushed me backward onto the pillow that
Eddie had so thoughtfully placed inside. Before I could protest Eddie lifted up
on the handle and started walking!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She hardly weighs anything at all in this.
Piece of cake!&#8221; Eddie said as he pushed me along.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;HEY! STOP this thing! Get me out of here! I
mean it, guys. I&#8217;m not going to the village ESPECIALLY not in this thing. You
can just forget about it . . . STOP, I said!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Everyone just laughed out loud. &#8220;Oh Hanna, quit
your whining. You&#8217;ll have a great time you&#8217;ll see!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I must have looked so stupid sitting there with
my legs dangling out of the front of the wheelbarrow , my arms in their casts
sticking straight up in the air as I bounced along the road with the girls
leading the way. At least I was sitting on my bare backside so no one could see
. . . OMG, my butt! I suddenly remembered what I was wearing. I immediately
looked down and saw that my gown had ridden up. Apparently that happened when
the girls lowered me into the wheelbarrow. To my horror my vulva was almost
peeking out from underneath the fabric. I desperately tried to use my arms to
cover myself but it was no use. As the wheelbarrow rocked gently up and down as
Eddie walked, the material only crept up even higher! &#8220;HEY GUYS! Stop a
minute!&#8221; I shouted but they kept on going. They must have thought I was trying
to keep them from taking me along so they pretended to ignore me by singing
silly songs as they walked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">This was so humiliating. I was so pre-occupied
with the indignity of it all and the fact that I was being treated like a piece
of meat being hauled to market that I didn&#8217;t notice how quickly time was
passing. I just sat there in that wheelbarrow and sulked. I wasn&#8217;t sure who I
was angrier at &#8211; my so-called friends for doing this to me or with myself for
allowing it to happen. My brain was still clouded and things seemed to be vague
and surreal so much so that I was having a little trouble concentrating &#8211; that
is until I saw the village up ahead and all the people milling about on Main
Street. It was then I realized how literally inappropriate my clothing was and
how embarrassing this was going to be. &#8220;GUYS, PLEASE!&#8221; I shouted in a panic
hoping to get them to stop that childish singing and pay attention to me before
it was too late. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I tried to push myself up and out of that
contraption but it was no use. I was stuck. Being carried at such an awkward
angle it would have been hard for even a healthy person to get out of the thing
but being handicapped as it were it was darn near impossible! All too soon we
were on Main Street as my group was still singing and carrying on. &#8220;To the
market we will go; the market we will go; hi ho the Dario - the market we will go,&#8221;
they sang to the tune of that old nursery rhyme. I felt like such a little kid!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To my horror I looked down and by now my private
spot between my legs was completely out in the open &#8211; the cool air making
Goosebumps on my tender bare flesh! Anyone who looked down at me would clearly
see what wasn&#8217;t supposed to be seen! The sidewalk was full of people all
milling about going into and out of the little shops. My heart pounded with
fear at being so helpless in front of all these strangers. At first, few people
even paid me any attention. Then slowly one by one they began to notice. They
noticed alright and they stared. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Aw, what happened to the poor little dear?&#8221;
some woman asked as she stood next to the wheelbarrow. I wanted to die! I was
shamefully exposed and helpless. There was nothing that I could do about it. I
could only hope she wouldn&#8217;t notice and say something to humiliate me. I just
had to sit there and hope for the best pretending nothing was amiss. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She fell off a horse. We&#8217;re taking her out for
some fresh air. She was tired of being cooped up at home,&#8221; Debbie answered
helpfully.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;How sweet!&#8221; the woman said as she looked me
over and smiled; &#8220;Such nice friends you have dear. I hope you&#8217;ll feel better
soon, little girl.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">LITTLE GIRL?! Why would she think that &#8211; because
I was wearing such a childish gown with teddy bears or was it because I just
looked like a pathetic little kid? How old did she think I was anyway? I wanted
to smack that old biddy right in the kisser but all I did was giggle. That&#8217;s
right, I giggled. I had no idea why I was chuckling &#8211; perhaps it was because I
was so embarrassed that&#8217;s all I could do or perhaps it was the pills making me
respond in such a goofy manner! I really didn&#8217;t know but I giggled at the poor
woman. Eddie picked up the handle and walked on. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As I nervously looked around I saw people
looking at me and shaking their heads. Were they feeling sorry for me because
of my injuries or were they disgusted that I was flashing my private parts so
shamefully. I felt my face flush with embarrassment. I was a couple of miles
from home wearing practically nothing looking like a little kid and there was
no way I could make it home on my own even if I wanted to. I was totally at the
mercy of my so-called caretakers!</span>

<b style="">Hanna&#8217;s Embarrassing Accident! </b>(reluctant
exhibitionism, self-discovery.)<br>
By <b style="">Hooked6</b> (<a href="mailto:Hooked6@hotmail.com">Hooked6@hotmail.com</a>)</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter
10</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Our little parade was interfering with traffic
and it was evident that we had to get off the street. Eddie pushed me up onto
the sidewalk and our group kept walking. This made things infinitely worse as
people were much closer to me than they had been when we were on the road, now
passing within mere inches of my wheelbarrow! There was no hiding below the
metal edges of my makeshift cart now. Here everything was available for people
see - . It was maddening looking at all the different facial expressions as
people passed. The smiles were the worst! It was as if they were saying &#8220;I know
what&#8217;s going on here&#8221; or &#8220;I saw something I wasn&#8217;t supposed to see,&#8221; or worse
yet, &#8220;Oh, look at the little girl dressed in her Teddy Bear Pajamas!&#8221; My
stomach was all tied up in knots! All I could do was to try and keep up the
pretense that I was unaware and helpless. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally I could see the &#8220;BUS STOP&#8221; sign up
ahead. The bus company ran a service to Rockford 4 times a day. Rockford was
the nearest &#8220;big&#8221; town to my village and many people who lived here worked in
Rockford or traveled there to make connections with the bus line to other
cities or towns. Consequently at rush hour the bus was almost always full.
Lunch time was no exception. To my horror there was a huge line of people
waiting on the sidewalk for the bus to arrive. My heart continued pounding as I
realized these dodo-heads were actually going to try and get me to travel with
them wearing my teddy-bear gown! A gown that didn&#8217;t fit!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I tried consoling myself that with the large
crowd that was waiting, the bus would be sold out and there would be no room
for us or that they wouldn&#8217;t allow me on because of my injuries or how I was
dressed. Surely there are rules about this sort of thing, I thought. I began to
feel better about the whole situation and hoped that soon we would all be going
back home. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie parked me unceremoniously on the sidewalk
right next to the door of a store that sold newspapers and magazines. It did a
good business catering to those who had to ride the bus regularly. They also
sold bus tickets for those who didn&#8217;t want to bother with having the correct
change every day consequently it was very busy with people coming and going
into and out of the store. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The gang went inside leaving me sitting in my
wheelbarrow all by myself! All I could do was stare at the people in line as
they looked at me wondering what was going on.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hanna?&#8221; a voice called out above me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I snapped my head around and saw my high school
math teacher. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Mr. Jenkins!&#8221; I managed to say in a startled
high pitched voice. &#8220;Um . . . I . . . that is . . . my friends are helping me
to . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">His face had a very puzzled look as he studied
me for a moment. &#8220;What happened, Hanna? You look pitiful.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I had a little accident, Mr. Jenkins. I
fractured a few bones and . . . um . . . I&#8217;m okay though.&#8221; I felt like such a
fool slumped back in this ridiculous wheelbarrow wearing . . . OMG! I
immediately looked down and my greatest fear was a reality &#8211; I was totally
uncovered down below - worse than I had been earlier. In fact the hem of the
gown was now around my belly button!! I looked up at Mr. Jenkins hoping against
hope that he hadn&#8217;t yet noticed but his eyes were glued to my pelvis. He must
have noticed the sudden dropping of my head to look down at my gown and
naturally he tried to see what I had been worried about. He saw alright &#8211; BOY,
did he ever! My face was burning with shame. Here was my teacher looking right
at my naked, now hairless private place. MY TEACHER for Pete&#8217;s sakes! Can you
imagine? </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oops,&#8221; he said with an embarrassed, little laugh.
&#8220;Let me help you with that. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get you right.&#8221; He then grabbed
the hem of my gown and tugged ever so carefully until I was at last covered. Of
course in doing me this little courtesy, his face was uncomfortably close to my
pelvis as he bent over and his fingers were practically on the doorstep to my
vulva &#8211; so much so that I could feel the hair on his knuckles tickling my skin
as he struggled to pull the fabric low enough so that it covered the
essentials. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said with a kind face after he was done. &#8220;These
things happen. I imagine there are a lot of things that you can&#8217;t do for
yourself after your accident. People understand. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re doing
this on purpose,&#8221; I was sure he added that last part in an obvious attempt to
console me. If he only knew!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mr. Jenkins bid me farewell, admonished me to
take care of myself and not overdo anything and then he left.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I mentally kicked myself for being so stupid -
My MATH teacher &#8211; of all people!! I had such a crush on him last year. He was
in his late twenties and was such a hunk. I tortured myself wondering just what
he had thought of me seeing me like he did. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Where the hell are they?&#8221; I cursed impatiently
under my breath as I tried to turn enough to peer into the store. I couldn&#8217;t
prop myself up adequately to get a good look so there was nothing left to do
but sit and try to act as though I was invisible. Just then the bus pulled up
and people began clamoring to get aboard the moment the driver opened the
doors. A smile came over me as I thought that maybe, just maybe the bus would
leave while those idiots were in the store and they would have no choice but to
take me back home. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;GOTTEM,&#8221; Donna exclaimed waiving the tickets in
her hand. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Eddie grabbed my wheelbarrow and began heading towards
the bus. When he got to the door the driver looked at me for a moment and then
looked towards the back at the bus. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Can she stand?&#8221; he finally asked as he got up
from his seat. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure she can, with a little help.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The driver made the couple in the front seat
move to the back of the bus telling them that a &#8220;crippled girl&#8221; needed the
seat. Crippled girl indeed! I was insulted but then realized that is exactly
what I was &#8211; a crippled girl. I HATED being so helpless. The girls grabbed me
under my arms and lifted me out of the wheelbarrow exposing my naked backside
to the rest of the people on the sidewalk. I couldn&#8217;t bear to turn around and
see how many people were actually gawking at me. Instead I wanted to hurry and
fix the problem before anyone realized.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WAIT!&#8221; I exclaimed in a panicked whisper. &#8220;My
gown - They&#8217;ll see!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; Donna said giggling.
&#8220;People will understand.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That&#8217;s the second time I heard that phrase in
just a few minutes. I didn&#8217;t care if THEY understood or not. It was MY exposed
butt that I cared about.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The girls helped me to the bus door then turned
me over to the driver who stood in front of me on the steps grabbing me under
my arms as the girls pushed me on my rear end as I hobbled my way up the rest
of the steps. Twice the driver&#8217;s hands slipped as he tried to steady me
effectively copping a feel of the sides of my breasts sending a shiver up my
spine. When I was completely on the bus, the driver used his leverage to turn me
so that I could sit down. I swore I heard more than a few snickers as the
people seated in the rows behind me got a good look at my uncovered derriere. Finally
I was seated with the leg in the cast sticking out into the doorway aisle in
front of me. Donna, Debbie and the boys climbed on and went looking for any
available seats in the back. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;This is nuts! How am I going to get about when
we get to Rockford?&#8221; I snapped flippantly to Donna as she slowly made her way
to the back of the bus.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry miss,&#8221; the driver said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put
your cart-thingy underneath the bus in the baggage compartment. It will fit
fine. I&#8217;ll get it out for you when you get to Rockford.&#8221; Then looking back at
Donna added, &#8220;Clever idea, that wheelbarrow. I&#8217;ll have to remember that. Where
are you girls going in Rockford?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;The mall,&#8221; Donna replied with a HUGE smile. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The driver gave me a wicked grin and took his
seat and started the bus moving down the road. &#8220;That&#8217;s my first stop.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I couldn&#8217;t believe it! We were actually going to
Rockford with me practically naked! To a mall no less! &#8220;I gotta get out of
here,&#8221; I muttered to myself as I felt the beginnings of a panic attack coming
on as my little village disappeared in the dust behind us. I felt safe in my
little village. Now I was heading to Rockford some 25 miles away! I nervously
began looking around this way and that. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was looking for
exactly but I needed to do something. ANYTHING! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then it dawned on me that there really wasn&#8217;t
anything I could do. I had no control. The miles were clicking away as the bus
sped along. What was the driver supposed to do - let me out of the bus to
hobble my way back to my village? I tried to calm myself. I needed to mentally
accept that this wasn&#8217;t any big deal. Handicapped people have to get out and
about too. After 15 minutes or so I felt my heart rate returning to normal and
that drowsy mental fog began to once again come over me. I hadn&#8217;t been to the
Rockford mall in several years. I tried telling myself that this little outing
could be a lot of fun and that Billy was right in that it sure beat sitting
around in that hot house without electricity. How bad could it be, anyway? I
loved to shop &#8211; even just window shopping. What girl doesn&#8217;t? I just needed to
try and concentrate on the bright side and not to get all stressed out over
every little thing. Heck I didn&#8217;t even have to pay for the bus ticket. How
often does a thing like THAT happen?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then I saw it &#8211; the mall! My Gosh, look at all
those cars!! There were hundreds of them and those were just the ones I could
see! This place was HUGE! Much bigger than I ever remembered it being and it
was PACKED! To think that a few moments ago I thought that Main Street in my
village was busy. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It took all my control not to piss myself right
then and there. I wanted to go home!! What had I been thinking?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The driver pulled the bus up to the sidewalk
near the main entrance of the mall and stopped. He told me to remain seated
until the other passengers heading to the mall got off since dealing with me
would take longer. As soon as he opened the door about a dozen people got up
and started exiting the bus. A couple of college-aged boys that were sitting
behind me got up as well. They smiled at me as they reached the door and one of
them said, &#8220;It was nice SEEING you today. Hope you get better soon.&#8221; The smile
on his face told me all that I needed to know. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When the aisle was clear the driver got up and
extended his arms beckoning me to try and stand so he could help me up and off
the bus. I shuddered at the thought of standing up and flashing my butt again.
I couldn&#8217;t help but look back towards the rear of the bus to see how many
people were still there and as I had thought, there were a bunch still on board
and they were all staring at me. &#8220;Come on missy, I haven&#8217;t got all day. I&#8217;ve
got a route to keep,&#8221; the driver prodded and he reached his arms forward. I
sighed and did my best to prop myself up and slide forward a bit in my seat.
The driver slid his hands under my arms again and lifted. No sooner than I was
standing I heard the familiar snickering behind me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna and Debbie finally reached me and helped
the driver get me off the bus and stayed with me supporting my arms as he got
my &#8220;cart-thingy&#8221; as the driver called it from out of the baggage compartment.
It took him a while to get it out and the entire time I was standing there on
the sidewalk near the entrance as my poor excuse for a gown flapped in the
breeze behind me. The ENTIRE busload of remaining passengers seemed glued to
the window watching the entire scene unfold. There was nothing I could do but
stand there.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As the driver headed my way with my
&#8220;cart-thingy,&#8221; a gust of wind kicked up and blew my gown high up my abdomen
completely exposing my pelvis to the people on the bus!!! I screamed and after
a second or two Donna reached out with her free hand and tried to push the
fabric down. It was so embarrassing! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Funny thing though, despite my distress I felt
myself getting aroused and that familiar tingle down below made its presence
known. I had just flashed my bits to a bus full of people! Well, technically
the WIND flashed my bits but the result was the same. I can&#8217;t even begin to
describe the feelings I was having. Even now I can still see their faces
looking at me as that happened! I felt flushed and a bit woozy. I was wet and
week-kneed. Just then the driver arrived and the girls gently put me back into
my stupid wheelbarrow. Standing on the sidewalk when the wind kicked up I felt
the focus of pleasure. Sitting my wheelbarrow I now felt like a stupid little
kid! The driver tipped his hat, re-boarded the bus and drove off leaving me
essentially stranded. I wanted to yell, &#8220;wait don&#8217;t leave me,&#8221; but instead I
just looked at my last refuge of safety driving away.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Do I HAVE to sit in this thing?&#8221; I protested.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so stupid!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The girls just laughed and totally ignored my
protestations. &#8220;Relax, will ya,&#8221; Debbie said giggling. &#8220;This will be fun!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m starved. It&#8217;s almost one o&#8217;clock. Let&#8217;s go
to the food court and get something to eat.&#8221; Billy said trying to change the
subject. Eddie wasted no time and picked up the handles and started towards the
door. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WAIT! Don&#8217;t take me in there! It&#8217;s indecent! Hell,
I&#8217;M indecent! STOP . . . please!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Before I knew it Debbie had opened the door to
the mall and we were inside. I dared not yell for fear of attracting attention
to myself &#8211; as if a half-naked girl wearing a teddy-bear gown sitting in a
wheelbarrow wasn&#8217;t attention getting enough! I just slumped there like a frozen
statue. People were everywhere! I looked down at my legs and I seemed to be
covered but just barely. If I moved the least little bit I&#8217;d flash the entire
mall! Do you know how difficult it is to keep your legs closed as you are bouncing
up and down in a wheelbarrow over a tiled floor? It was only a matter of time
and I knew it. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The group moved quietly through the mall as if
nothing was amiss &#8211; as if we were just ordinary shoppers. At first I got only
an occasional stare as people were basically just going about their business &#8211;
as if a person in a wheelbarrow was a perfectly normal thing. I laughed to
myself as the thought came into my head that a person could probably walk
around naked and if she acted like everything was fine no one would notice.
What a ridiculous thought. I convinced myself it was my hormones and those darn
pills doing my thinking for me. Still the fact that people seemed indifferent
to my plight was okay with me. Maybe this won&#8217;t be so bad after all. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When we got to the food court it was still
pretty crowded. Donna managed to spot a table for two that was vacant and Eddie
rushed me over to that spot before anyone else took it. Seeing that places were
limited and the likelihood of the five of us eating together were slim, Donna
suggested that she would stay with me and the others should all go out on their
own and that they could eat, shop or do whatever they wanted provided that we
all meet out front by the main entrance at 3:30pm so we could catch the last bus
back to our village at 4:00pm. Reluctantly the others agreed. I could tell that
Debbie and her boyfriend Eddie were hesitant about leaving Donna alone with me
but it was obvious that they loved the idea of being able to venture out on
their own as a couple. Billy didn&#8217;t seem to care one way or the other and
simply said it was a good opportunity to chat up some chicks. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The rest of them bid Donna and I goodbye and
soon were out of sight. &#8220;What would you like to eat?&#8221; Donna asked as she
scanned around the various eateries encircling the seating area. &#8220;There are so
many choices . . . I know, I&#8217;ll just surprise you with something. I&#8217;ll be right
back!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; I whispered in a panic but it
was too late. She was gone in a flash. I was a nervous wreck as I looked around
at the people eating their meals. Every time I caught some group looking at me
they would quickly avert their eyes, pretending they hadn&#8217;t really been looking
at all. There was no doubt, however that I was the center of attention. I must
have glanced down at the hem of my gown a hundred times just to be sure I was
covered. It looked okay to me but I couldn&#8217;t really be sure what others were
seeing. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna finally returned with some stir-fry stuff
and a large cup of soda. She began talking to me in an exaggerated motherly
tone as if I was a child or something. &#8220;Here ya go Lamb-y-kins, a nice hot
meal! Don&#8217;t worry I&#8217;ll feed you. Open wide like a good girl.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It was sickening. Before I could say anything
clever she practically rammed the spoon into my mouth and I had no choice but
to eat. People were watching me and grinning! It was so humiliating! Then I
spotted them! To my horror were 6 classmates of mine from school! What were
they doing here at the Rockford mall?! Fortunately they were at quite some
distance away on the other side of the seating area and were busy talking
amongst themselves so I didn&#8217;t think they had spotted me yet, but there was no
doubt about who they were. PLEASE don&#8217;t let them see me, I prayed under my
breath. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The process continued and got worse as Donna
continually &#8220;mothered&#8221; me, wiping my chin, cautioning me to be sure and chew
everything carefully. I wanted to belt her one right in the head with one of my
casts. It would have hurt too. It might have made my fracture worse but it
would have been worth it. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When she was done feeding me she began eating
her own meal as I sat there looking at all the people around us. Most were just
enjoying their meals but sooner or later everyone stole a glance at the poor
pitiful girl in the wheelbarrow. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally Donna had finished eating and was
sipping her drink obviously enjoying her moment in the spotlight. &#8220;You do
realize that I&#8217;m going to get you naked at some point don&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said as
she leaned over whispering to me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh don&#8217;t act all surprised. I KNOW that&#8217;s what
you want. You&#8217;re not fooling me. Why else would you ride a horse topless for
miles &#8211; practically in your own back yard?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re out of your fricken mind!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna laughed. &#8220;I can tell you&#8217;re getting off on
this. Do I have to finger you to prove it?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming. You can&#8217;t tell anything.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna got that sly, knowing expression on her
face that was a trademark of hers at school. &#8220;That sweet feminine scent of
yours doesn&#8217;t lie, you know. Besides, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. It
will go a lot easier if you do things my way. If you fight me, I&#8217;ll make it
harder on you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t dare! We&#8217;ll both get arrested and
I know for a fact that your parents would kill you if that happened. You&#8217;re not
going to do anything so stop all this nonsense and let&#8217;s go find the others.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The laughter that rang out from Donna was
chilling. She obviously wasn&#8217;t the least bit concerned.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Relax, sister. I know what I&#8217;m doing. You have
the PERFECT excuse. Just enjoy the moment. Just imagine . . . I can expose you
anywhere, anytime, in any way I want. Even here! Wouldn&#8217;t that be fun?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I looked at her in terror. I couldn&#8217;t figure out
what she was up to. Perhaps she was just trying to mess with me and get me all
riled up - perhaps as a way of asserting some power-ego thing or something.
Surely she wouldn&#8217;t really . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I just love the way your eyes get all big and
round when you&#8217;re scared to death. Just look at you!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I snickered. That&#8217;s it &#8211; she was just messing
with me. Her last comment proved it. I let out a sigh of relief. Then suddenly
I knew she was deadly serious. &#8220;Donna, no!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna began using her napkin to pretend to wipe
any crumbs from my lap. There were no crumbs but her actions kept teasing the
hem of my gown, raising it higher and higher as she wiped my upper thighs causing
me to briefly expose my nether regions to the light of day before the gown was
left to return to its normal position. She seemed to enjoy teasing me in front
of everyone. &#8220;Now finish your drink and we can go,&#8221; she said in a loud and
overly-animated voice, almost as if she was speaking to the crowd and not to
me. She motioned for me to try and use my hands to grasp the cup. Instinctively
I held them out to show her that I couldn&#8217;t hold onto anything with my casts &#8211;
my fingers frozen in place. I thought that would have been intuitively obvious
to her and that she was just horsing around. Instead she put the
partially-filled cup between my wrists, closed them so that they were against
the cup and let go! The cup instantly fell into my lap and I was soaked! It all
happened so fast I couldn&#8217;t react.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NOW look what you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; she said as she
jumped up from her chair excitedly! &#8220;YOU&#8217;VE SPILLED YOUR DRINK!&#8221; Her loud voice
drew the attention of many people sitting nearby. She looked at me with a look
of mock maternal disapproval surveying the mess I had just made. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get this cleaned up.&#8221; She then began using some paper napkins from the
dispenser on the table to hurriedly try and blot-up the small spill. Then to my
horror she actually lifted up the hem of my now soaked gown and bunched it up
near my belly button, totally exposing my dampened pelvis as she continued
dabbing with her paper napkins. &#8220;Just look at you. You&#8217;re soaked!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My face burned with shame and humiliation. I
couldn&#8217;t believe she was doing this to me! I was so taken by surprise that I
just sat there frozen as a million thoughts ran through my head. The people
around me were all gawking at me, some grinning, others with a look of empathy.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Donna, STOP IT&#8221; I said under my breath.
PLEASE!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get you cleaned up. I&#8217;ll only be a
minute.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just as I thought things couldn&#8217;t get worse a
woman in her early fifties came over to my wheelbarrow. &#8220;Oh the poor dear,
she&#8217;s really in a state, isn&#8217;t she? I feel bad for her.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna kept wiping away and tossing the wet,
half-shredded napkins on the floor and grabbing new ones from the dispenser. In
her best troubled voice she said, &#8220;Yes, I feel badly too. This was supposed to
be a fun outing for her. She&#8217;s been through so much and hasn&#8217;t been out of the
house for such a long time. I only wanted her to get out and have a little fun.
Oh well . . . I guess we&#8217;ll have to cut our little trip short. Pity, we only
just got here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">What the hell was she talking about? I haven&#8217;t
been cooped up for a long time. Besides, there was no way we could cut our trip
short as we had to wait for the bus. I gave Donna my best strained look of
disapproval which was a mistake as this woman apparently took it for a look of
regret and disappointment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh your trip doesn&#8217;t have to end now. I suspect
it was probably a major ordeal just getting her out and about and I can see by
her expression how disappointed she is. Here, let me help you. If you have
something to cover the poor child with for a few moments I can take that
hospital gown to the women&#8217;s restroom and wash out that soda residue on the
bottom half there and use the forced hot &#8211;air hand dryer to dry it out. It will
only take a few moments and your trip will go on as planned. It&#8217;s the least I
can do to help out the poor unfortunate girl.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What a GREAT idea! Thank you!&#8221; Donna replied
enthusiastically. &#8220;Now what can I cover her with? I didn&#8217;t really bring
anything else.&#8221; Donna furled her brow as if she was really pondering the
situation. &#8220;I know! I&#8217;ve got the perfect solution. Here, help me get this gown
off of her.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To my absolute horror the women stepped closer
and began pulling at the top of the gown to remove it from my shoulders! Not
being tied in the back it slid easily away from my body. &#8220;NO WAIT!&#8221; I cried but
it was of no use. The woman&#8217;s determination to help was greater than my resolve
to stay covered. In an instant the gown was off my arms and began its descent.
I watched in abject terror as it was pulled slowly down my chest until my less-than-endowed,
puffy little breasts came into view, </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The lady obviously sensed my panic and tried to
reassure me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be embarrassed, honey. It will all be over in a moment.
Besides, everyone here saw what happened and understands. Many of us have
children of our own, you know. Don&#8217;t fret over it, okay?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Hell no it wasn&#8217;t okay! In my mind I wanted to
scream a litany of obscenities at this idiot but, like before, all that came
out was a giggle. That&#8217;s right, another juvenile, out of place giggle! Those
damn pills! Either they were the culprit or the absolute indignity of it all
was so overwhelming that it was the only coping mechanism to this stress that I
had to draw on deep within my being. I laughed even harder when the woman
pulled the half-soaked gown completely away from my body leaving me totally
naked in this stupid wheelbarrow as dozens of curious onlookers were intent on
watching everything. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right back,&#8221; the woman said as she
disappeared with the only article of clothing that I had! I let out a silent
scream in my mind that, if it had been audible, would have left me deaf for
days!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;There go those lovely huge eyes of yours
again,&#8221; Donna said whispering to me. &#8220;That look of terror is priceless! You&#8217;re
so adorable when you get like that.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wanted to kill that bitch. I was now
completely naked and totally at her mercy &#8211; just the way she wanted. Donna had
that evil, knowing grin plastered in her face as she pretended to get more
napkins to finish the job she had started earlier, except that there weren&#8217;t
any more in the dispenser at our table. &#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; she said feigning surprise.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve used up all the napkins. I&#8217;ll be right back. I need to get some more.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Instead of going to the next table she walked
among the seats FOUR TABLES AWAY leaving me exposed and helpless with everyone
staring at me! I could hear her ask in a loud voice, &#8220;Do you mind if I borrow
this?&#8221; as she picked up the napkin holder at that table. Of course the people
sitting there didn&#8217;t mind, yet Donna felt it necessary to take great pains to
thank them pausing sufficiently to explain my predicament and the reason she
needed to borrow the dispenser, all the while leaving me hopelessly exposed to
those sitting closest to me. It was a good thing the place was crowded
otherwise the entire Food Court would be seeing my naked body. As it was, the
people that had gathered to watch my little scene unfold seemed to be screening
the rest of the diners from getting a good look at me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna returned and resumed her blotting even
though my skin was totally dry. She was definitely putting on a good show,
paying special attention to my nipples which by now were extremely sensitive
and as large as pencil erasers. Then she made sure to rub extensively between
my legs, something that sent jolts of electricity up my spine! Finally she
stopped as she threw the last napkin on the floor with the others. She took a
moment to look over her handiwork and then added, &#8220;There, that&#8217;s better. Now
let&#8217;s get you covered.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Covered? With what, I wondered? Then I saw the
madness of her plan. She pulled out a paper napkin, folded it in half and
placed it lengthwise between my legs so that my vagina was covered. Like most
napkins in fast food places these days it was flimsy and almost worthless
having a width of barely 3 inches. If I hadn&#8217;t been recently been forcefully
shaved, my pubic hair would be sticking out all over the place. Then she took
out another napkin, opened it up and spread the now thin piece of paper across
my boobs which barely covered my nipples leaving the sides of my somewhat less
than impressive breasts uncovered. &#8220;PERFECT!&#8221; she announced with pride. &#8220;At
least you&#8217;re decent. This will do until that woman gets back.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">DECENT?! My nipples were practically poking a
hole through the paper! I looked like a total buffoon sitting there in a
wheelbarrow barely covered with paper napkins! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The people next to us eventually began slowly
filtering away going about their business, having long-since finished their
meals. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I had to resign myself that I was indeed totally
at the mercy of Donna and there was nothing that I could do about it that
wouldn&#8217;t make things worse for me. I could only hope to go along with her
scheme and take her at her word that if I didn&#8217;t, she would really make this
horrible for me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna began picking up the soggy napkins from
the floor and put them on her lunch tray along with the remnants of our meal.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right back. I&#8217;m going to go and throw this stuff away,&#8221; she said
smiling. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go anywhere without me.&#8221; With that she got up and began walking
towards the nearest trash can, which was some distance away against the wall
near one of the fast food places that lined the seating area. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My heart pounded. Not only was I practically
naked in the mall but I was now alone! I kept begging her to hurry the hell up
in my mind &#8211; practically pushing her with my thoughts to get the lead out and
get her ass back here. I was so vulnerable sitting here all alone like I was.
My body was signaling danger! I wanted to run for cover but that was
impossible.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then I became aware of the other messages that
my body was trying to tell me. I was horny and oh so very aroused. So many
strangers had seen my naked body &#8211; everything I had &#8211; no secrets left to the
imagination. I had been forced to show it all . . . and I liked it! I NEVER
would have had the courage to appear naked to strangers &#8211; NEVER, ever, could I
have found it within me to do something like that. I practically gushed with
sensual sensations. I gushed elsewhere too &#8211; much to my chagrin. I could only
hope that people couldn&#8217;t tell.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As the place cleared out even further I began to
relax. Soon this little ordeal would all be over. Donna would have had her fun
and I would have something to dream about in the nightmares of my sleep at
home. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My thoughts were abruptly halted when I saw . .
. &#8220;NO! Please NO!&#8221; I screamed half under my breath. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
