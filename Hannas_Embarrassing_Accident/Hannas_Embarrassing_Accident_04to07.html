<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When I awoke the next morning the sun was
already up and shinning on my face through my open window. The cool, gentle
breeze of the early morning and subtle scents of the rose bushes in the flower
garden outside beckoned me up from my slumber. Somehow all the events of the
previous day seemed but a dream &#8211; a nightmare really &#8211; a distant but unpleasant
memory. Surprisingly, I felt pretty good and was only reminded of my
incapacitated state when I tried to rub the sleep from my eyes and nearly
knocked myself silly as the hardened cast on my wrist slammed into my face. It
was almost comical, actually, if it wasn&#8217;t happening to me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Good morning, Sunshine! It&#8217;s about time you
were awake.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It was Donna. Damn, it wasn&#8217;t a dream after all.
&#8220;Leave me alone. I don&#8217;t need anyone to look after me so you might as well just
get on out of here,&#8221; I said as I quickly looked down to make sure I was
covered. &#8220;I&#8217;m not helpless you know.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Fine, have it your way. But we promised your
mother that we&#8217;d stay with you all day in case anything happens. We&#8217;re in the
kitchen fixing breakfast if you decide you want anything.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WE? Who&#8217;s we?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Why Debbie, Billy, Eddie and ME, of course, who
did you think?&#8221; With that she gave me a smirk and left the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That&#8217;s all I needed, a bunch of morons to get in
my way. My mother is such a worry-wart! Still, after her not so veiled threat
yesterday, I didn&#8217;t have much choice.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Those pills the Doc gave me left me a bit groggy
but they also took away all my pain so other than being in a little bit of a
fog I felt fine. With a little difficulty after making sure no one was around,
I managed to slide out from under the bed sheet and, as I had feared, was still
naked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I sighed long and hard. Now what was I going to
do? Part of me wanted to crawl back under the covers but that wasn&#8217;t going to
be as easy as getting out from under them. I darned sure wasn&#8217;t going to go out
there naked either!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aromas emanating
from the kitchen, however, sure smelled good and were calling to me making my
stomach do summersaults. I didn&#8217;t realize that I was so hungry!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Perhaps I could find something to wear that I
could manage to get on myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked
around my room to see if I could spot anything that I could use but nothing was
in plain sight. &#8220;Perhaps in my closet,&#8221; I thought to myself and tried my best
to stand only to fall back clumsily into my bed. Walking was definitely going
to be a challenge and not something I was going to master without a lot of
practice.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As I laid there pondering my situation, Donna
walked in. &#8220;Good! I see you feel like getting up and about. Here, let me help
you.&#8221; Before I could say anything she had her arm around my shoulder and was
doing her best to sit me up on the edge of my bed. She was the LAST person I
wanted to touch me &#8211; even IF she was trying to be nice and come to my aid. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That was easy,&#8221; she said as she patted my
thigh. &#8220;Would you like me to help you to the kitchen table? Surely you must be
starved as your mother said you slept right through dinner.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO! I DON&#8217;T want you to help me to the table.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh, I get it. You thought I was going to walk
you out there naked, didn&#8217;t you? Don&#8217;t be daft, girl. Let&#8217;s see what we can
find for you.&#8221; With that Donna got up and started going through my drawers.
Holding up an older pair of plain white cotton underwear she asked, &#8220;How about
these panties, will they do?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just the thought of her touching my intimate
apparel made me squirm. She just HAD to pick a well-worn, nearly threadbare
pair, I thought to myself. Still, she WAS being helpful, almost kind really.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll do,&#8221; I said wanting to get dressed as quickly as possible in case
someone else came in while I was naked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna grabbed them, came over to the bed where I
was sitting and carefully guided them over my cast and then up my legs and
eventually sliding them over my hips as I awkwardly tried to lift myself up off
the bed an inch or two using my good leg. At last I was at least partially
covered!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That looks better, now for a shirt of some
kind.&#8221; She rummaged through my closet and tried some of my blouses but my casts
wouldn&#8217;t fit through the arm sleeves. &#8220;How about a T-Shirt?&#8221; she asked holding
one up but I had the same problem with them. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After searching for a while she eventually found
my bikini top, the infamous top that I had hung on a tree branch the day
before, and put it on me. Having her adjust it so that it covered my
less-than-adequate boobs was like totally weird though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also ultimately found a pair of my only
shorts with wide leg holes that she helped me into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh to be decent again, I thought to
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least my biggest fear was
over, or so I thought.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna helped me into the kitchen and I was
cheerfully greeted by the others as they prepared me a plate. The first
indignity of the day came rudely upon me as I realized that I couldn&#8217;t feed
myself. Because my fingers were immobile, there was no way I was going to pick
up a spoon or a fork. Debbie immediately took stock of the situation and taking
matters into her own hand began helping me eat. For the first time in my life I
was humbled at the realization that I needed other people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt utterly disgraced as my classmates
Billy and Eddie watched me being spoon-fed. My only compensation was that the
food was fantastic.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When breakfast was through we sat talking for a
while and for a bunch of otherwise selfish and conceited morons, they all
seemed quite pleasant towards me. Little did I know then that it was all part
of their plan. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All too soon another problem made itself known &#8211;
I had to pee. I tried to get out of the chair myself but Donna stopped me,
&#8220;Just where to you think you&#8217;re going?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I need to take care of something. I&#8217;ll be
alright. You guys just clean up the kitchen.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna sat there with a silly grin as Debbie got
up and started clearing up the dishes. After multiple attempts of me falling
back into the chair making no progress at all, Donna asked, &#8220;Would you like
some help or do you plan on breaking your good leg too?&#8217;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I was beaten.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Donna helped me to the toilet. &#8220;I can manage from here I&#8217;ll call you
when I&#8217;m done.&#8221; I said trying to be dismissive hoping she&#8217;d take the hint.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh yeah? How are you going to get those shorts
and panties off? Are you planning on pissing in your britches or something?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can do it.&#8221; I said smugly and nodded in the
direction of the door once again motioning her to leave.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;This I gotta see. Go on. If you can do I&#8217;ll
leave you alone. Otherwise I&#8217;ll be here to help. I don&#8217;t want you to fall and
hurt yourself just because of your stubborn streak.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I tried and tried in vain to get them off but it
was impossible with both wrists in those casts!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;FINE!&#8221; I snapped back sarcastically as I turned a deep red, &#8220;Would you
please help me . . . BUT CLOSE THE DAMN DOOR FIRST, will ya?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna giggled and without doing as I had asked
reached out to unfasten the snap on my shorts and bent down to lower them to my
ankles. She looked up at me as she was still kneeling on the floor and slowly
teased me with her fingers as she reached inside the elastic of my panties to
remove them, starting and stopping to re-adjust her grip all the while grinning
from ear to ear as her fingers went deeper and deeper, carelessly brushing my
loins sending chills up my spine. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; I chided, &#8220;Unless you want me to
piss all over your face you had better get on with it!&#8221; She laughed aloud and
yanked my panties to the ground and helped me back onto the toilet and stood
back looking at me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can do this part by myself&#8221; I snapped curtly.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No sense in leaving as you&#8217;ll be done in a
minute,&#8221; she replied making it clear she had no intention of missing out of one
single moment of my humiliation. I did my best to pretend that I wasn&#8217;t
bothered by any of this but I knew that she wasn&#8217;t buying it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact she seemed to be relishing my situation.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When I had finished she helped me stand up by
having me lean on her shoulder for support. It was harder to stand than I
thought with my shorts and panties around my ankles as I couldn&#8217;t spread my
legs out far enough to use my good leg for balance as much as I needed to.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;EDDIE!&#8221; Donna screamed out at the top of her
lungs. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT ARE YOU DOING CALLING FOR EDDIE?! Are you
crazy?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can&#8217;t hold you. You&#8217;re slipping!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I am NOT!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I shouted but my protestations were mute as Eddie came running into the
bathroom as I stood there bottomless. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are you guys okay?&#8221; he asked half out of breath
staring at my pelvis. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Help me stand her up better,&#8221; Donna instructed
as Eddie took hold of my other side and tried to steady me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m FINE!&#8221; I protested again, Stop babying me!&#8221;
But those two weren&#8217;t satisfied until I had been &#8220;accidentally&#8221; groped and
fondled all under the guise of keeping me from falling.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay I got her now,&#8221; Donna finally said. &#8220;Thank
you, Eddie, you&#8217;re a life saver.&#8221; Eddie smiled proudly, let go of me and then
headed toward the door when Donna added, &#8220;Oh, while you&#8217;re here . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Grab some tissue, will ya? I&#8217;ll hold her steady
while you wipe, okay?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO WAY!&#8221; I shouted.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Just simmer down. Needs must, I&#8217;m afraid. This
isn&#8217;t exactly fun for us, ya know. It has to be done.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Before I could react, Eddie eagerly thrust his
hand holding a wad of tissues between my legs and began softly rubbing from
back to front.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All I could do was groan! It was all too
embarrassing yet the sensations were incredible. A BOY was rubbing between my
legs! A BOY!!! Oh my gawd, what the hell?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I couldn&#8217;t believe it! A Boy &#8211; a classmate
nonetheless &#8211; had his hand between my legs touching my . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was all so overwhelming and everything was
happening so fast! I had dreamed about the day a boy would touch me there but,
not like this and CERTAINLY not Eddie!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna noticed the expression on my face and
tried to console me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let this bother you, Hanna. I know this must be
embarrassing but we&#8217;re not trying to make you uncomfortable. Honest. We&#8217;re only
trying to help, okay?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie looked up with a confused expression as he
stopped wiping and said, &#8220;Umm . . . how long do I need to do this? How do I
know when I&#8217;m done?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna laughed, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make a career
out of it. Just wipe until everything is dry, silly.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie pulled out the tissue and seeing that it
was damp tossed it into the commode and grabbed another wad and recommenced
softly wiping. It was clear he was trying to be as respectful as he was gentle.
No doubt he was trying to do a good job but, like me, he was clearly uncomfortable
with all this as it must have been the first time he touched a girl this way as
well. His fingers were clumsily rubbing my bare skin and my most sensitive
spots almost as much as the tissue he was trying to hold!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As he wiped the sensations below reached a
crescendo. The feelings &#8220;down there&#8221; were so intense they were electrifying!
All too soon he pulled out the tissue and looked at it again and remarked,
&#8220;Still wet.&#8221; And proceeded to toss this new wad into the commode and he
repeated the process grabbing another wad of paper.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna laughed hysterically and gave me the
weirdest smirk. She KNEW what was going on and egged poor Eddie on. &#8220;That&#8217;s it,
keep on until it&#8217;s dry.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">What the hell was Donna playing at? Was she
trying to have him make me climax or something! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;OOOOHHHHH!&#8221; I moaned as he stimulated a very
sensitive spot.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Donna asked coyly, as if she
didn&#8217;t know. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Noth . . . ing. It&#8217;s . . . um . . . my leg . .
. it hurts that all!&#8221; I said with my voice quivering and my breath panting
heavily. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie withdrew his hand and looked very
concerned. &#8220;Maybe we had better let her sit down. She looks like she&#8217;s going to
faint or something.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, or SOMETHING,&#8221; Donna said giggling all
the more. &#8220;Help me sit her back on the toilet. Will you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie reached out and held onto my waist as he
stood in front of me and assisted Donna in lowering me backwards until I was
firmly planted on the seat. I was glad to be sitting . . . until I noticed
Eddie with a strange expression on his face. I suddenly realized that my legs
were wide open and he had an up close and personal view of things!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I immediately squeezed my legs together and I
knew I must have been blushing profusely. Eddie was blushing almost as much as
I was! Clearly he didn&#8217;t quite know what to make of all this and politely
looked away almost simultaneously as I shut my legs together. Seeing HIS shock
and discomfort was more unsettling for me than my own as it made the whole
situation seem bizarre and almost too unreal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My head was spinning trying to cope with all this. If these things
happened at a hospital with professionals I probably wouldn&#8217;t have given it any
thought but these were my classmates for heaven&#8217;s sakes &#8211; people I went to
school with!! I was NEVER going to live this down. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; text-transform: uppercase;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After I caught my breath I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m okay now.
Could you guys help me up, please? I&#8217;m ready to get out of here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna took the lead and the two of them stood me
back up. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got her now, Eddie. Go ahead and pull her clothes back up while
I make sure she doesn&#8217;t fall.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eddie reluctantly agreed and knelt down and
began pulling up my panties. Feeling his fingers once again so close to my
inner thighs made me all the more aroused. I was sure with his face so close to
my pelvis that he would pick up on the feminine scent of my arousal. If he did
he mercifully didn&#8217;t say anything. After several awkward attempts he finally
got the elastic around my waist and my panties in place. My shorts came next
which were much easier although his fumbling with the zipper almost made me
lose it once again! At last I was dressed again &#8211; if one could call wearing a
skimpy, loosely-tied bikini top and a pair of shorts dressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The two of them guided me back into the front
room and placed me in an easy chair. Thank goodness THAT was over!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">No sooner had I gotten comfortable in my chair
there was a knock at the front door. Billy jumped up to get it and there
standing outside was Mrs. Henderson and her teenaged son, Carl. Mrs. Henderson
was a close friend of my mom and owned a small dress shop in the village and
also did alterations.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hello Hanna, your mom told me about your
accident and asked me to stop by and check on you to see how things are going,&#8221;
she said sweetly as she let herself in. &#8220;Feeling any better today?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I told her that I was doing as well as could be
expected under the circumstances but that it was awkward trying to adjust to
the casts. I tried to sound reassuring as I didn&#8217;t want her to report back to
my mom that things were amiss. I didn&#8217;t want mom to worry so I made sure that
she knew that I was managing just fine.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Her son Carl looked quite sad as he surveyed my
situation. &#8220;Gee, you must be in a lot of pain?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Not really,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Doc gave me some pills
and they seem to do the trick. I&#8217;m okay really.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; Donna remarked dutifully.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time for another one of your pills.&#8221; She handed me a glass of water and
stood by as she made sure that I swallowed it. I hated those things as they
always made me seem groggy like I was in a fog or something. I never seemed to
feel like I was thinking clearly just after I took one. Still I wasn&#8217;t in any
pain so I guessed they must be doing their job. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There was an awkward silence as no one quite
knew what to say next. Finally Eddie spoke up and related how difficult it was
for me to stand without help and how I couldn&#8217;t even go to the bathroom myself
because I couldn&#8217;t take off my own clothes. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh you poor dear,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson said. &#8220;I see
the problem. With those casts up to your fingers I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t really do
much on your own. It&#8217;s a good thing you have these friends to stick by you and
help. I see why your mother was so relieved to have them close by.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to do it. We don&#8217;t mind at all,&#8221;
Eddie volunteered enthusiastically. &#8220;Hanna&#8217;s really a trooper too. She takes
things all in stride even when we have to do things that are . . . you know,
embarrassing and all.&#8221; His comment made Debbie and Billy giggle. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna came over to me and put her arm around my
shoulder supportively and added, &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of work for all of us, really.
There&#8217;s so much to do. In fact, we were just about to help Hanna with her bath
when you knocked on the door.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You were?&#8221; I asked a bit confused. I didn&#8217;t
remember anyone saying that, did they? It must be the pills, I thought. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes, we WERE,&#8221; Donna said authoritatively.
&#8220;Just look at your hair. You haven&#8217;t had a proper wash since the accident. You
certainly don&#8217;t want your mother coming home after work and seeing you all
pitiful-looking, do you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No, I guess not,&#8221; I replied thinking that what
she had said made a lot of sense. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t take a bath! I can&#8217;t get these
things wet and YOU guys CERTAINLY aren&#8217;t going to wash me. That ain&#8217;t gonna
happen.&#8221;<br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now Hanna,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson said in a motherly
tone. &#8220;Donna is right. You&#8217;ll feel better after a good washing up. It&#8217;s like a
tonic, you&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;ve had some experience with this sort of thing. Help me
stand her up, girls.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">What? No wait . . . I . . . I . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Before I could react Donna and Debbie took me by
the arms and had me standing in no time. Mrs. Henderson came over and began
unbuttoning the snap on my shorts. She surely wasn&#8217;t going to undress me right
here in the living room in front of EVERYBODY, was she?!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No stop! This isn&#8217;t a good idea. Not here! Not
in the living room! Not in front of . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just then my shorts fell to the ground exposing
my panties to her son and the boys. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about a thing,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
said. &#8220;Needs must, I&#8217;m afraid. You certainly can&#8217;t manage this by yourself.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That was the second time I had heard that phrase
and I was beginning to despise it. Even in my fog which made things seem like
they were happening in slow motion I KNEW that this was wrong. I shouldn&#8217;t be
stripped naked in front of all these people. That can&#8217;t be right, could it? I
almost fainted when I felt her hand reach around to untie my bikini top. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO DON&#8217;T!&#8221; I screamed, but it was too late as
my top fell to the floor exposing my boobs to the room. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<b style="">Hanna&#8217;s Embarrassing Accident! </b>(reluctant
exhibitionism, self-discovery.)<br>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Chapter
6</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I almost panicked when I looked up and saw the
stupid grins on the faces of the boys in the room as each and every one of them
had their eyes glued to my now exposed nubbin-like breasts. I was so mortified
I could hardly stand it, yet what could I do? Both of my arms were over the
shoulders of Donna and Debbie who were helping me keep my balance as I tried to
stand. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mrs. Henderson had me step out of my shorts that
were now around my ankles. She must have sensed my agitation as she remarked,
&#8220;Hanna, it&#8217;s not like your friends don&#8217;t recognize your situation. They do. This
is something that just can&#8217;t be helped. Don&#8217;t worry about it. They really DO
understand. When you grow up you&#8217;ll look back on this and realize just how
valuable their assistance really was in your time of need.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">WHEN I GROW UP?!! How old did she think I was,
anyway?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in high school for Pete&#8217;s
sakes. I was about to let out a tirade that would have made a sailor blush when
I felt Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s fingers reach inside the elastic of my panties! &#8220;NO
WAIT!&#8221; I shouted but she just smiled and I watched in frozen terror as my
cotton white panties were lowered to the ground and I was made once again to
step out of them. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;There, that&#8217;s better.&#8221; She replied as she
picked up my clothes and took them into the kitchen leaving me with my arms
still desperately clinging to the shoulders of my classmates - totally exposed
to the room. I couldn&#8217;t even use Mrs. Henderson as a shield to keep the boys
from seeing all of me as she had left the room! Things just couldn&#8217;t get any
worse.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hello there, anyone home?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My heart began skipping beats as I heard a man&#8217;s
voice call from outside the screen door at the front of the house.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We&#8217;re in here,&#8221; Donna called out to the
stranger.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I looked in terror as a man who appeared to be
in his mid-twenties wearing some kind of professional work clothes entered the
house and stopped dead in his tracks when he saw me standing there in the front
room completely naked being supported by my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Is this a bad time?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We were just helping my friend here to get
ready for her bath,&#8221; Debbie answered matter-of-factly. &#8220;Can we help you with
something?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The man looked me up and down with an awkward
smile. He then cleared his throat and trying to sound business-like said, &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;m from the electric company and just wanted to tell you that we are going to
be working on the power lines in a little while and you might experience some
random power outages for the rest of the day and possibly tomorrow.&#8221; He then
stopped mid-sentence as he stared at me some more. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I decided to stop
by seeing how your friend here is injured. Is she okay? I need to know if this
will be a problem - being without electricity, I mean.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wanted to curl up and die! This guy was a hunk
and he was seeing me naked! Standing there all muscular-like with blue eyes and
sandy-blonde hair he was my dream-guy come true and he was looking right at
me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt myself immediately gush with
excitement down below. My body was screaming, &#8220;Take me now. Please have your way
with me!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then that idiot said, &#8220;The reason I ask is that
we have to take extra precautions if children might be adversely affected.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I wanted to scream out at him. &#8220;&#8220;YOU
ASSHOLE!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How dare you call me a child?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">But Donna spoke up before I had the chance, &#8220;No,
I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be a problem. We&#8217;ll be okay. Thanks for letting us
know.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The man looked right at my chest form a few
moments, smirked and then said, &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about your friend. I hope she&#8217;ll
be all right. You know when she gets older you&#8217;re going to have to keep an eye
on her. She might end up being a guy magnet.&#8221; His words made all my classmates
laugh hysterically. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I was fuming! Even though my mind was moving in
slow motion I knew enough to realize that I was being insulted<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . or . . . did he really just give me a compliment?
I wasn&#8217;t really sure. I did know, however, that I was really, really aroused or
was that just my pills talking? Even if he was a handsome hunk, part of me
wanted to give that arrogant fool a piece of my mind but he quickly turned and
left house leaving me standing there red-faced and listening to these supposed
friends of mine laughing at me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mrs. Henderson, oblivious to the fact that a
utility man had just dropped by, finally returned to the room. &#8220;There now, I&#8217;ve
got everything all set up. Can you girls help Hanna and follow me?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna and Debbie helped me turn around and
hobble my way after Mrs. Henderson giving the boys a perfect view of my exposed
backside. I must have looked a sight with my butt cheeks wobbling as I limped
along trying not to fall! I could almost imagine the expressions on the faces
of those boys as their eyes followed my every movement.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After reaching our one and only bathroom I
noticed that my neighbor had partially filled the tub with water. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
going to work,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;How am I going to get in that thing?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am going to show you. I&#8217;ve done
this before and trust me, this might seem awkward but I assure you that it will
do the trick.&#8221; She then took up a position in front of me next to the tub. &#8220;Now
girls watch me carefully. I want you to turn little Hanna so that her backside
is against the tub like this. Then Hanna, I want you to raise your hands in the
air like so and then as the girls support you carefully lower your hind end
into the water so that you are resting against the bottom of the tub with your
legs hanging out in the dry. Then you can rest your back against the wall to
support yourself as you hold your arms in the air so your wrist casts don&#8217;t get
wet either. Just think, Hanna, in a little while you&#8217;ll feel so much better!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I think I understand,&#8221; Donna said as the girls
maneuvered me into position. Before I knew it I was gently forced backwards
into the tub and was soon sitting in waist high water. I felt like a fool
sitting there like that with my legs spread dangling over the side.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Perfect!&#8221; Mrs. Henderson said. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll leave
you girls to wash her up. When you are done you can get her up and dry her off.
That&#8217;s all there is to it!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WAIT!&#8221; I howled in a panic. &#8220;Where are you
going? You can&#8217;t leave me!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mrs. Henderson turned and gave me the most
pleasant and reassuring smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re in good hands. I&#8217;m sure your friends can
handle this. I have to get into town. I&#8217;m late opening my shop as it is. Time
is money you know. I&#8217;ll let your mother know that I checked in on you and that
everything seemed to be going well. I&#8217;m sure that she&#8217;ll be relieved &#8211; she
worries so, you know, although I don&#8217;t know why as you seem like such a
responsible and obedient person. I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t give these girls ANY
trouble, right?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No ma&#8217;am, but . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll see you later, my dear. I really
MUST get going.&#8221; With that she left the room and before long I heard the screen
door slam shut against the house. She was gone! The only responsible person who
stood between me and . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Right, let&#8217;s get down to it, shall we?&#8221; Donna
said with a huge smile. &#8220;Washcloths, where are the washcloths,&#8221; she said as she
looked around. &#8220;Oh never mind, I&#8217;ll make do.&#8221; She then squirted some body wash
into the palm of her hand, and then began lathering me up. She was touching my bare
skin with her BARE HANDS!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was all so
embarrassing. She started with the exposed skin on my arms below my casts as I
held them in the air being careful not to get my casts wet. Then after rinsing
my arms using a glass full of warm water from the tub she started on my
shoulders and underarms. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Noticing the stubble as I hadn&#8217;t shaved my
underarms in a few days, she asked Debbie to hand her the razor and before I
knew it she was doing it for me! &#8220;There, that&#8217;s better,&#8221; she said with pride. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I literally gasped as I felt both girls&#8217; hands
lathering my chest rubbing their fingers teasingly over my nipples.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oooh, sensitive are they?&#8221; Donna asked
giggling. &#8220;Maybe we should make sure we give these a little extra attention,&#8221;
she instructed Debbie as she continued to glide over my breasts. &#8220;She might
have scratched them or something during her TOPLESS fall the other day. I
wouldn&#8217;t want her to get an infection because of poor hygiene.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It was sheer torture! The sensations of having
another person&#8217;s fingers touching me that way was overwhelming. I found myself
unconsciously rocking my hips against the bathtub floor, lost in the moment as
it were until Debbie apparently noticed and remarked, &#8220;I think she likes all
this attention. I would too If I had been through everything she&#8217;s had to
endure the last two days.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Despite their altruistic statements, there was
no doubt in my mind that they knew what they were doing to me yet, for some
reason, I didn&#8217;t protest like I knew deep down that I should have done. I just sat
there compliantly and let them do what they wanted. It was shameful I know but
that&#8217;s what I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After rinsing my chest, Donna then asked Debbie
to help me stand up. &#8220;Just keep your bad leg out of the tub for a minute,
Hanna.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once I was standing, Donna lathered up my good
leg that was in the tub slowly making her fingers up toward my hips. I almost
fainted when her fingers reached in between my legs touching my vulva! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;HEY! STOP THAT!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Just relax kiddo. I&#8217;ll be done in a
minute.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued gliding her soft
and soapy fingers back and forth across my labia sending me into a dream-like
state. All I could picture in my mind&#8217;s eye was that young utility man and I
imagined standing naked before him once again as he drooled over my body. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All of a sudden my muscles tightened, my
breathing became rapid and I began to shudder! I had the most intense orgasm I
had ever experienced in my entire life!! The girls were laughing their fool
heads off but I didn&#8217;t care. I wanted the spasms to last forever! My legs
squeezed together so tightly that I trapped Donna&#8217;s hand and I wouldn&#8217;t let it
go until the pleasure has subsided. Try as she might she couldn&#8217;t pull free.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Let go of me, you bitch,&#8221; she screamed half
serious, half in jest. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When it was over I was so drained I just stood
there. I was brought back to my senses when I realized I felt something
scraping my skin. I opened my tightly shut eyes and there was Donna shaving my
scant pubic hair!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><br>
&#8220;What the hell are you doing?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;STOP IT!&#8221; I exclaimed again. But it was too
little too late. My precious hair was gone. What had taken me so long to grow
had taken Donna all of a few seconds to remove.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked sarcastically, &#8220;You wanted to
keep that? It was so thin I thought, just like your underarms, that you just
hadn&#8217;t had time to shave it. Oops, sorry about that. My bad.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; Debbie added with a giggle, &#8220;It&#8217;ll
grow back . . . eventually.&#8221; Her comment only made Donna laugh all the
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As I looked down I realized that now more than
ever I looked like I was much younger than I really was. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s do your hair and we can call it a
day.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;How in the heck are you going to do that
without getting water everywhere or my casts wet?&#8221; I asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna thought about it for a minute then said,
&#8220;I know just the way to do it.&#8221; Donna then spread the towels that were hanging
up on the towel rack onto the floor next to the tub. &#8220;Debbie, help me get her
out and onto these towels.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">With much effort the girls managed to get me out
of the tub and balanced on the towels on the floor. &#8220;Okay, now what, Brainiac,
You can&#8217;t wash my hair out here, can you? All that work for nothing.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;On contraire, my boobless wonder. Let&#8217;s get you
turned around facing the tub then let&#8217;s see if you can get down on your knees.
If you can, we&#8217;ll have you bend over and dangle your hair into the tub and we
can wash and rinse it that way.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
made sense to me as I realized that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who could hurl
insulting pet names</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Debbie chimed right in, &#8220;Sounds like a
plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let&#8217;s try it.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once again I was out-voted and much to my
surprise I found that I could actually get on my knees and bending over the
side of the tub was easy. I had to stay kneeling the whole time, however, bent
way over at the waist as it were, because if I crouched into a more comfortable
position my arms would get in the way. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The girls then proceeded to shampoo my hair. I
really hated to admit it but I was indeed most grateful that my hair was
getting washed. I hadn&#8217;t washed it in a couple of days and when I usually wait
that long it gets pretty greasy so this was truly a treat. &#8220;Needs must,&#8221; I
heard the little voice in my head say causing me to chuckle. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After rinsing, Debbie decided to apply some
conditioner as well and began massaging it into my long locks of hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh darn it all,&#8221; Donna suddenly exclaimed as
Debbie continued running her fingers through my hair working in the conditioner
trying to remove any tangles. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I used all the towels and we are almost done
here.&#8221; She explained, then, without any warning at all she shouted, &#8220;BILLY,
EDDIE . . . SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ME SOME TOWELS AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are you doing? They&#8217;re right outside in
the linen closet.&#8221; I snapped. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Too late; the boys came running into the
bathroom like the house was on fire or something. There I was bent over with my
head in the tub and my bare behind facing the doorway!! I could only imagine
what a view they both were getting!! I tried to raise my body up but Debbie
pushed my head back down into the tub, &#8216;HOLD STILL! I&#8217;m not finished yet!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I knew what she was doing. She was prolonging my
embarrassment by keeping my vulva exposed to the boys and there was nothing I
could do but endure the shame. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WOW!&#8221; Billy remarked, &#8220;She&#8217;s wet!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Oh that did it. There was no way I was going to
take rude comments like that about my state of arousal &#8211; even if it WAS true.
&#8220;Shut the hell up, Billy Templeton.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now, now, there&#8217;s no need to be rude. Billy was
just surprised that you were out of the tub dripping water all over the place.&#8221;
Then Donna added, &#8220;what in the world did you think he meant . . . OH . . . I
get it. That&#8217;s sweet.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What,&#8221; Billy asked innocently.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Never you mind,&#8221; I quipped. &#8220;It&#8217;s none of your
business, that&#8217;s what.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Geesh, why are girls always so moody? I just
asked a simple question.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally Debbie announced that she was through.
&#8220;She&#8217;s ready to dry, I think.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Donna took hold of one arm and Debbie the other
and they helped me to my feet and turned me around. &#8220;What are those two creeps
still doing here?!&#8221; I shouted seeing the boys still in the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We need their help, silly,&#8221; Donna said with a
sly voice.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Doing what?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Just stand still. This will be over in a
minute.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">With the girls on each side of me, the boys,
using small hand towels that they had grabbed from the kitchen of all things,
began wiping my skin dry! Towels and a stray finger or two rubbed literally ALL
of my body &#8211; over my nipples, between my legs, and most shamefully between my
butt-crack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it hadn&#8217;t felt so good I
would have complained. Instead I stood there silently taking it all in like a
good little girl as the boys smiled eagerly and the girls chuckled away.
Through it all I kept trying to convince myself that they weren&#8217;t taking
advantage of me &#8211; they were just trying to help. No matter how many times I
said that in my head, no matter how many different ways I tried rationalizing
it, it still seemed wrong and untrue. Somehow though, it did seem to make me
feel better just telling my brain that &#8220;needs must.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Okay Guys, thanks. I think I am dry now,&#8221; I said
politely hoping to put a stop to it before I had another orgasm in front the
boys this time!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are you sure,&#8221; asked Eddie with an evil grin on
his face, &#8220;I mean you&#8217;re still pretty wet down here.&#8221; His comment made everyone
but me laugh hysterically.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, you moron! Give it a rest will you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The boys reluctantly left the room as I sighed
in relief, glad that this ordeal was over. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get my clothes back on and get me back to
my chair.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; Debbie remarked with obvious concern.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh dear, what?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I think Mrs. Henderson took them with her when
she left.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well . . . we&#8217;ll just have to find something
else for me to wear, won&#8217;t we? I quipped sarcastically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? Donna pointed out, &#8220;We
already tried everything you owned and the only things that fit were your
bikini top and the shorts you were wearing before.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">DAMM! I hated it when she was right.</span>
