<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My step-sister&#8217;s face was full of delight as she
realized the opportunity that just presented itself. &#8220;Oh this is rich!&#8221; she
said as she got up and came over to me. She playfully reached up and pinched me
on the cheek. &#8220;Now remember little sister, don&#8217;t move a muscle! Your time isn&#8217;t
up yet.&#8221; All the others let out a nervous giggle as they watched my step-sister
skip towards the front door.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She no sooner opened it when three boys from
school, more eleventh graders, burst into the room, &#8220;Hey Karl, we saw your car
and . . . HOLY CRAP!! She&#8217;s NAKED! &#8220; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Everyone laughed at the boy&#8217;s comment. &#8220;You&#8217;re
having a party and you didn&#8217;t invite your best buds?! What&#8217;s up with that?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie grinned from ear to ear and beckoned the
boys in for a closer look. &#8220;My step-sister, Annie, just got a whippin&#8217; for
stealing. Check it out. See how red her ass is?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The boys all gathered around my backside and
began ogling my stripes. &#8220;Man! That must have hurt!&#8221; one boy said as he pulled
out his phone and raised it up to take a picture of my butt.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No pictures, boys. No touching either,&#8221; My mom
said as she suddenly came into the room, &#8220;But you can look all you want.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Good morning, Mrs. Swanson,&#8221; one of the boys
said in an overly polite tone. &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry. We didn&#8217;t mean to intrude. We just
stopped by because we saw Karl&#8217;s car out front and wondered if . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s alright, boys. You don&#8217;t have to
apologize. The world doesn&#8217;t stop revolving because Annie made a bad decision
and had to suffer the consequences.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My mom then continued with her usual morning
routine of straightening up the room as everyone looked at me in silence.
Finally my mom spoke up, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, guys. You can talk. Say what&#8217;s on your
mind. Don&#8217;t mind me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Of course everyone was too wary of my mom to
actually say anything so they just sat there quietly on their best behavior as
my mom finished her work. But as soon as she left the room, everyone started
all talking at once. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You should have been here earlier . . .&#8221; Katie
said excitedly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah we got to watch get a blistering! It was
so cool!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The comments then came in rapid fire succession:
&#8220;That&#8217;s awesome, DUDE. Were you here the whole time? SWEET!&#8221; and &#8220;How long has
she been like this&#8221; to repeated remarks like, &#8220;Damn! I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s
actually NAKED and your mom is making her stand here in front of us like that.
This is way better than television!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie of course just HAD to explain everything
and I had no choice but to stand there as she went into every little detail of
what had happened that morning. It was like I had to relive my humiliation all
over again!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Just look at how cute her butt is!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">This went on for about ten minutes when the
doorbell rang yet again!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie&#8217;s eyes grew wide with anticipation,&#8221; Who
on earth . . .?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; one of the newcomers said, &#8220;I hope you
don&#8217;t mind. I texted a few friends of mine and told them to get over here right
away if they wanted to see Annie naked!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;<b style="">YOU DID
WHAT?!&#8221;</b> I exclaimed angrily. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ANNIE MARIE,&#8221; my mother&#8217;s voice bellowed from
behind me. &#8220;You know darned well you&#8217;re not supposed to talk during corner
time! That&#8217;s another 15 minutes, young lady for talking.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But MOM! That&#8217;s not fair! That moron <i style="">called</i> people to come over! He can&#8217;t DO
that!!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Who says? Are YOU making the rules now? I don&#8217;t
think so.&#8221; She said sarcastically. She then came around in front of me and
looked me in the eyes for a moment as the doorbell rang a second time making me
jump a bit. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As she looked at me as I stood there with my
hands on top of my head literally trembling now, her expression softened and
almost appeared warm or compassionate, &#8220;You&#8217;re scared aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked in
a soft, sympathetic tone, almost as if she could sense my fear.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Since I wasn&#8217;t supposed to talk I just nodded my
head.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;This really bothers you, doesn&#8217;t it - people
seeing you naked and punished like this?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I nodded again; almost relieved that she was
finally beginning to understand what she was doing to me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I imagine it&#8217;s especially hard when it involves
people you may know from school.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Once more I nodded vigorously in agreement as
the doorbell rang several more times in quick succession, as if the person at
the door was growing impatient. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My mom gave a little knowing smile as she
stepped back away from me. &#8220;Good, maybe this will teach you to use better
judgment so that this won&#8217;t be necessary again. Let whoever it is in, boys.&#8221;
And then speaking to my step-sister, &#8220;Add 15 more minutes to her time, Katie
and make sure the newcomers know the rules.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes mom!&#8221; she answered eagerly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When Karl opened the front door, two girls and
another boy came in that I also recognized from the junior class of eleventh
graders. They too were ecstatic to see that what they were told in the text
they had received was correct.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;My Gosh . . .&#8221; one girl said as she came over
looking at me with a smirk on her face, &#8220;Guys, she goes to our school! I know
you. You&#8217;re Annie Swanson!&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen you around campus a lot.&#8221; Her wicked grin
sent a chill up my spine that spelled trouble for me!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I knew that girl quite well. Her name was Lisa,
a senior, and she had the reputation of being a real bitch at school always
picking on the underclassmen whenever she felt like it. Of all people to see me
this way!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Once again I had to endure a round of teasing
from these new arrivals and how they couldn&#8217;t wait to tell everybody about it
on Monday.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It sounds like you&#8217;re going to be pretty
popular at school, little sister,&#8221; Katie teased.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;LITTLE sister is right,&#8221; the other new girl
said. &#8220;Are you SURE she&#8217;s in high school?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Listening to their comments all the while
standing naked in front of the window watching the occasional neighbor pass by
hoping like heck that they wouldn&#8217;t look in or that the moron who liked to text
wasn&#8217;t busy with his fingers again on his phone&#8217;s keyboard made that extra
fifteen minutes seemed like it lasted for hours! Though I couldn&#8217;t see a clock
from where I was standing, I kept looking at my step-sister trying to let her
know that I thought my time was up. She just smiled back at me. Though I had no
proof, I was certain that she was prolonging my time well past the appropriate
length just to humiliate me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Finally my mom came back into the room and
announced that I finished and that I could go to my room. Of course she had to
lecture me in front of the all the people from school for another five minutes
like I was a little girl making me feel like I was only 5 years old. As I
started for the stairs I had one consoling thought &#8211; at least these newcomers
didn&#8217;t see me in those horrid kiddie panties!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh Annie . . .&#8221; my mom called out almost
singing my name. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your underwear.&#8221; I turned around and there she
was dangling those idiotic teddy bear panties in front of the whole room! Everyone
laughed hysterically. I wanted to die!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Those few steps towards my mother to retrieve
those ridiculous panties were some of the hardest steps I ever had to take. I
could just see the smiles on everyone&#8217;s faces as I marched myself silently back
into the room to take them from her to choruses of &#8220;Awww, look at the little
girl underwear. Aren&#8217;t they CUTE? Some day when you grow up you can wear real
big girl panties.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The following Monday I arrived at school and I
no sooner entered the building where my locker was when I heard Lisa shout out
at the top of her lungs &#8211; &#8220;LOOK, It&#8217;s RED FANNIE ANNIE!&#8221; Everyone laughed and
it became clear that the story of my punishment was all over campus! I blushed
terribly and tried my best to ignore the comments, but that wasn&#8217;t always
possible.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hello, RED,&#8221; a guy said teasingly as I changed
classes later that morning. It sounded like an innocent comment &#8211; IF I had red
hair which I didn&#8217;t. I knew what he meant so I snapped back, &#8220;SHUT THE HELL
UP!&#8221; That was a mistake as my comment was overheard by a teacher and I was
reprimanded on the spot and made to apologize, much to the delight of the boy. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I soon learned that it was best just to keep my
big mouth shut and pretend that it didn&#8217;t bother me. That was easier said than
done, however, especially for me with my hot temper. Whenever I heard someone
calling out, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s RED FANNIE ANNIE,&#8221; All I wanted to do was punch the
bastard in the mouth.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The next morning I felt horrible. I was so
depressed I didn&#8217;t want to go to school and face the crowd again. I told my mom
that I was sick and felt like I had the flu or something. Naturally she felt my
head, took my temperature and gave me the once over. The thermometer said my
temp was normal so I told her that I was really nauseated and felt bad. I knew
that I didn&#8217;t have a fever. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She&#8217;s just trying to get out of school, mom,&#8221;
Katie offered as she passed by my room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought too,&#8221; my step-mom
answered back. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No mom, I&#8217;m really sick, honest. Do you think
I&#8217;d risk another spanking so soon?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I just need some sleep. I won&#8217;t be able to
concentrate on anything feeling this way and besides, the school nurse will
probably call you to come from work and take me home anyway.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My step-mom looked me over carefully. &#8220;Fine; if
you&#8217;re really sick you need to go and see Dr. Henderson. I&#8217;ll call him and make
an appointment for you before I go to work, but if he says your normal &#8211; watch
out sister, that&#8217;s all I can say.&#8221; She then stormed out of the room telling
Katie to get ready for school as they had to leave shortly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I collapsed back on the bed. I knew Doc would
probably not find anything wrong with me but I really couldn&#8217;t face that crowd
of bullies again today. I needed time for all this to blow over. At least I was
going to get that. I&#8217;d have to deal with whatever the doc says later.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Just before my step-mom left to take Katie to
school she came back upstairs. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be home at lunch to take you to the
doctor&#8217;s office. You&#8217;d best be here ready to go when I get here, understand?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I slept for several hours and just did happen to
get up in time to take a shower and get dressed. Mom came home just as I was
coming down the stairs. Seeing her I immediately put on my sickly look and
dragged myself into the front room and collapsed on the chair just for show in
order to sell her on the fact that I was sick. I could have been an actress I
thought as I figured my performance was pretty convincing if I had to say so
myself.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When we got to the car I saw Katie sitting there
in the front seat. &#8220;What&#8217;s SHE doing here?&#8221; I asked flippantly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I went and got her from school and gave excuses
at the office for both of you. I have to make up this time that I&#8217;m missing at
work because of you so I won&#8217;t be able to pick her up when school is out. I&#8217;ll
save time this way by taking you both home after your appointment rather than
making another trip to school later just to get Katie.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Great . . . that&#8217;s all I needed was to have my
step-sister messing about at home later on while mom was back at work. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Doc Henderson&#8217;s office was in an old house off a
residential street rather than in one of those professional buildings. The
waiting room was in really what used to be the home&#8217;s living room before Doc
moved in and remodeled a bit. He was an old man who never said much &#8211; just
grunted a lot when he examined you, but I liked him. I think he was gruff on
the outside but deep down he was really an old softy. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When we got there at 12:30pm, the waiting room
was completely empty. &#8220;Good,&#8221; mom said seeing that no one was ahead of me. &#8220;You
should be able to get in and out right away and I can get back to work.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Just then a fairly young-looking college-aged
girl in medical scrubs appeared at the counter, &#8220;Hello Mrs. Swanson. Just sign
in. As I&#8217;m sure you know the office is closed now for lunch. As we are working
your daughter in without an appointment, I can do the preliminaries while we
wait for Doc to get back, which is usually around 1:30 or 2:00 depending on his
moods. He&#8217;s already left me instructions of what he wants based on your phone
call this morning so we can save some time by doing those before he gets back.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;TWO O&#8217;CLOCK!&#8221; my step-mom exclaimed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
be out of work that long! I thought her appointment was for 12:30pm. Heck, if
the doctor doesn&#8217;t get here until 2 and then takes his usual time examining her
I might as well miss the rest of the day&#8217;s work and I just can&#8217;t DO that.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well . . .&#8221; The girl at the counter said
politely. &#8220;I can understand your position. Listen, I have an idea. My sister is
helping us out today and will be leaving early. Why don&#8217;t you sign the forms
and go back to work and I&#8217;ll arrange for her to take your daughter home when
she leaves. Would that work for you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My mom looked thrilled at the idea. &#8220;That would
be WONDERFUL! Are you sure she wouldn&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh no, In fact she doesn&#8217;t live that far from
you anyway. I&#8217;m sure it would be just fine with her.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re a life saver, thanks!&#8221; She then signed
all the permission to treat forms and left, leaving Katie and I into the
waiting room. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I just barely sat down when I saw Lisa, the
senior high bitch that witnessed my shame the other day shuffling papers behind
the counter. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s SHE doing here,&#8221; I asked the medical
girl who was still at the counter.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Who, that girl?&#8221; she asked pointing towards
Lisa. &#8220;That&#8217;s my sister, Lisa. She helps out with the paperwork during her
Health Career&#8217;s class for school. Do you know her?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Before I could answer, that bitch spotted me.
&#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t RED FANNIE ANNIE!&#8221; she said quite loudly. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The medical assistant began laughing, &#8220;So you&#8217;re
Red Fannie, Annie? I&#8217;ve heard all about you.&#8221; She then came around the counter
and still giggling over her discovery of my identity said, &#8220;Come on - let&#8217;s get
you started before my sister picks on you some more.&#8221; She started leading me to
an exam room leaving Katie and Lisa to keep each other company in the waiting
room, which was fine by me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Now I must explain the way Doc&#8217;s office is set
up. The exam rooms are to the right of the waiting room &#8211; one is located just
off the waiting room and two more are down a short hallway ending with the
scale and eye charts. To the left of the waiting room are rooms for a lab area,
an x-ray machine and some kind of treatment room of some sort. It&#8217;s an
efficient use of space for a small house but the design leaves much to be
desired from a patient&#8217;s point of view. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Clarissa, the medical assistant&#8217;s name, led me
to the first room &#8211; the one right off the waiting room. Once inside she said,
&#8220;Like I told your mom, Doc left a list of things he wanted done before he got
back so let&#8217;s get started. Go ahead and take off all your clothes and I&#8217;ll be
back to get started.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ALL my clothes, what for?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way we do things for someone
with an unknown ailment. It makes it easier for Doc. I&#8217;ll be back in a minute
or two.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I started to undress and once I was naked I
looked around for one of those silly paper gowns Doc always used but I didn&#8217;t
see one. I was about to call out when Clarissa walked back in the room carrying
my chart.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Um, there are no paper gowns in here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Really?&#8221; she said as she began looking through
the drawers. &#8220;That&#8217;s odd. I&#8217;ll have to get you one in a minute. Let me go ahead
and get your temperature and blood pressure first.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I sat on the exam table as Clarissa put the
thermometer in my mouth and began wrapping the BP cuff around my arm. It felt
silly sitting there naked in front of her but she was a professional and this
probably wasn&#8217;t a big deal for someone who cares for sick people all the time.
Besides, after all that her sister Lisa probably told her, I didn&#8217;t want to
look foolish by acting like a little kid by complaining.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When she was through taking my vitals she began
asking me all sorts of health questions about my symptoms &#8211; some of which were
rather embarrassing and then jotted my answers down in my chart. Finally she
said, &#8220;Come on; let&#8217;s get your height and weight. She then opened the door and
started walking out down the hallway towards the scales. I managed to stop her
before she got too far. &#8220;I&#8217;m naked here. Can I get a . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh it&#8217;s just us girls here. The waiting room is
completely empty and this will only take a minute. Besides, from what I
understand both Lisa and your step-sister saw plenty of your naked the other
day.&#8221; Her smile made me blush as she obviously really did know the whole story.
She then grabbed my hand and started pulling me out of the room. Lisa and Katie
saw me walking down the hall completely bare and began to giggle. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">This was so embarrassing. Still I didn&#8217;t want to
appear as though it bothered me lest they tease me all the more so I tried to
act nonchalant as Clarissa marched me off down towards the scale at the end of
the open hallway. She dutifully recorded my height and weight then checked my

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh yes, Doc wants an abdomen X-ray too. Follow
me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;An X-ray?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s no big deal and it will show up any
problems with your bowel or whether you&#8217;re constipated or even if you have a
kidney stone, things like that. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s painless.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">It wasn&#8217;t the pain I was worried about. Once
again I had to come into the still empty waiting room and make my way all the
way across to the opposite side and enter the X-ray room. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Once in the room I asked her about my gown but
she informed me that she&#8217;d get it in a moment and the X-ray would look better
without one anyway. Since I had never had an X-ray before I figured I&#8217;d better
do as she said. It took her quite a while to set up and take the exposure then
she went outside somewhere to check the image, leaving me naked and on the
table. I didn&#8217;t know how long things like this normally took but it seemed like
quite a while before she came back. When she did she told me that I could go
back to my exam room. I opened the X-ray room door and noticed that the waiting
room was now almost full of people!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I immediately closed the door so that it was
almost shut and then peeked through the crack and saw Lisa manning the front
desk dealing with checking people in. &#8220;Clarissa, I can&#8217;t go out there. There
are PEOPLE in the waiting room! Where did they come from?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She looked out the door. &#8220;Well, that happens
sometimes. People come early even though the office is still officially closed so
they can get a jump on the paperwork. Now let&#8217;s get on with the rest of the
things we need to do. Besides, there aren&#8217;t THAT many people yet. Just wait a
little while and you&#8217;ll really see the room fill up.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes, but . . . I&#8217;m naked!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all the more reason to hurry up
and finish before the place really heats up. It&#8217;s unfortunate but it can&#8217;t be
helped. Who knew that this would turn into a busy day? You can&#8217;t hide in here
forever, you know.&#8221; She then grabbed my hand and literally pulled me out of the
X-ray room and walked me across the open waiting area as the patients watched.
No one said a word but they ALL looked! I was scared to death! I tried to cover
myself as best I could without looking ridiculous. I was naked in front of all
these strangers!!! It wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad if I was proud of my body, but
I wasn&#8217;t! I looked like a little kid and I sure as heck didn&#8217;t want people
seeing what I had or didn&#8217;t have! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She was just about to put me back in my original
exam room when she suddenly stopped. &#8220;Hold on a moment. I think you&#8217;re supposed
to have some lab work too.&#8221; She then left me standing there right in the middle
of room as she went up to the desk and began fumbling through some paperwork.
&#8220;Clarissa!&#8221; I protested in a panicked whisper! But she ignored me and went
about her work. I anxiously looked around at the people in the room. As soon as
they saw me looking at them they averted their eyes and pretended to read or
found something else to occupy their attention. But the moment I looked back at
the main desk I could tell they resumed their staring. &#8220;How could she do that
to me?&#8221; I thought silently to myself.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa looked up at me with a wicked grin. She was
up to something. I just KNEW it. I could feel it in my bones! That was the same
grin she had when I was being punished at home. She obviously loved this and
that was really getting to me.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">People were watching me and whispering amongst
themselves. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was all so embarrassing
yet this was all so seemingly innocent in an odd sort of way. That is until I
heard a little boy say, &#8220;Mommy that girl has no clothes on.&#8221; I looked over in
the direction of the voice and saw him pointing at me. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hush, now,&#8221; the mom told him and forced him to
look at the kid&#8217;s book he had been reading before I had entered the room.
&#8220;She&#8217;s waiting to see the doctor.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh . . .&#8221; the little boy said innocently and
went back to his book.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Clarissa continued shuffling papers as I
awkwardly stood there totally bare. I could have sworn that she was doing that
on purpose just to prolong my embarrassment. &#8220;Oh yes, here it is,&#8221; she finally
announced to the room as she held up a piece of paper presumably indicating
what I was supposed to have. &#8220;Follow me, Annie.&#8221; She said motioning me to
follow her back across the waiting room to the lab area. I could almost feel
the stares of all those eyes looking at my butt as I left the room. Gawd, I
hoped there were no remnants of the stripes I had received over the weekend.
That would be horrible! Imagine all those people seeing that I had received a
whipping! It was almost too much for me to cope with. I hadn&#8217;t looked at my
backside since that day it happened and then it looked awful! I could feel my
face flushing the more I thought about it.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Clarissa sat me down in a chair and proceeded to
draw my blood into one of those vials. She was surprisingly good at it and it
didn&#8217;t even hurt. She then gave me a small plastic jar with a lid and said, &#8220;I
need a specimen.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;A specimen of what,&#8221; I asked totally confused. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She laughed at my naiveté. &#8220;Just pee a little in
this cup and then give it back to me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What here . . . in front of you?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No silly. I&#8217;ll leave you for a moment so you
can have some privacy.&#8221; She then left. I had never given a specimen before so I
stood there awkwardly in the lab area wondering how I was going to do that
without peeing on the floor. Since she had said she only needed a little I
decided to just bend forward a little, spread my legs and hold the cup up
against my vulva and try to squirt just a little into the cup without making a
mess. Of course once I started I discovered that stopping was harder than I
thought it would be. The cup was half full when I tried to stop the first time
but all I managed to do was slow it down a little.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I was looking between my legs holding that
cup watching it fill higher and higher, Clarissa brought a teenage boy back to
the lab area. I was so shocked seeing him standing there looking at me that I
clenched my muscles tight which resulted in one big squirt splashing into the
cup spilling a good bit onto the floor before I managed to stop. I was so
embarrassed I didn&#8217;t know what to do!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are you doing, Annie? You&#8217;re supposed to
use the restroom behind you not give a sample in the middle of the room!&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I looked around and sure enough there was indeed
a restroom door right behind me. I felt so stupid! All I could do was
sheepishly say, &#8220;Oh . . . sorry.&#8221; I was so humiliated at my own ineptitude. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Clarissa sighed as though she was a bit put out
and took the cup from me, labeled it and set it on the counter. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
go back to the exam room while I finish up here drawing this boy&#8217;s blood?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;By myself?&#8221; I realized just how childish my
question was as soon as it left my mouth. &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">With more than a little apprehension I left the
room and made my way back across the waiting area. It was hard to do with an
escort. It was darn near impossible to do on my own! When I entered the exam
room I was in before, there was a middle aged man sitting on the table. My exam
room was occupied! &#8220;Oh, excuse me,&#8221; I said instinctively and backed out of the
room not knowing what else to do. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa was behind me giggling. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter
little girl, did you get lost?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No,&#8221; I snapped back in a firm whisper. &#8220;There&#8217;s
someone in my room!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. I forgot about you. I filled up
all three rooms with other patients.&#8221; She said plainly. &#8220;You can wait out in
the waiting room if you like.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are you out of your mind?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I guess you COULD wait up here at the desk with
me, I suppose.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Fat chance,&#8221; I said trying desperately to cover
myself with my arms as I was still in full view of the people in the waiting
area. I decided to see for myself if all the rooms were indeed occupied and to
my horror, they all had patients in them!! Not wanting to prolong my exposure I
spotted a small staff kitchen area at the back of the hall and I dashed right
into it. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I was there for about two minutes before old Doc
Henderson came in the back door of the office and saw me. &#8220;Young lady, just
what do you think you are doing?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I was at a loss for words. All I could do was
mutter ridiculous half-words that made no sense. Just then Lisa came around the
corner and explained that I was supposed to be getting ready for an exam and
there was a mix-up and all the exam rooms were filled so she chose to wait
here. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well, get someone OUT of one of the rooms so I
can examine her. She looks cold!&#8221; He barked impatiently. He was obviously in no
mood for such foolishness and his usual gruff manner came shining through.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Right away,&#8221; Lisa said and left. Finally she
came back and took me back to the original exam room off the waiting area leaving
me naked with no gown for cover. Doc came in and looked me over. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter with you? Wait, don&#8217;t tell me. You&#8217;re allergic to clothes.&#8221; I just
looked at the floor totally humiliated. &#8220;Well never mind. Let&#8217;s get on with
it.&#8221; He then did his usual exam, listening to my chest, looking in my throat
and asking me dozens of questions. Most of the time I had to make things up as
I wanted to at least try and appear as though I might be sick so I wouldn&#8217;t get
punished at home for faking an illness just to stay out of school. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can&#8217;t find anything wrong with you. Are you
sure you are really sick?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are you sure I&#8217;m not?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Listen, Missy, see that diploma hanging on the
wall behind you? It says that I know what the hell I&#8217;m doing. I can find nothing
wrong with you. Get dressed and you can go. I&#8217;ll have my assistant telephone
your mom and give her the good news . . . Damn teenagers.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I hoped off the table as he started to leave the
room. He suddenly turned around and looked me square in the face. &#8220;I sure hope
this doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re in for another rump roasting like your last one!&#8221; He
chuckled a little and left the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Holy Crap! Did he know about my last one? Who
told him? Then I saw my backside in the mirror hanging on the wall. &#8220;Oh . . .&#8221;
I said aloud. He could see for himself as my butt still bore the marks from the
other day. That meant that all those people in the waiting room also knew about
my whipping as well! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">That reminded me that when my step-mom finally
found out that I was faking it, I was going to be in for it again! This day
couldn&#8217;t get any worse.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I then realized that I didn&#8217;t have my clothes!
They were missing from the room! I looked around everywhere but they were
nowhere to be found. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>&#8220;That damn Lisa,&#8221; I
thought. I was going to kill her!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa and my step-sister came into the exam room.
&#8220;Are you ready to go?&#8221; Lisa asked. &#8220;They need the room.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Where are my clothes?&#8221;</span>

with them?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Very funny; now hand them over!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know what you are talking
about. Now let&#8217;s go. If you want a ride home with me we have to leave now.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I can&#8217;t go like this!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well you shouldn&#8217;t have been so irresponsible.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That did it,&#8221; I said angrily and charged right
for her. I wasn&#8217;t about to take that from anyone. If I was going to get my butt
blistered anyway, I might as well teach that bitch a lesson. Then I saw her
waving a paper with Doc&#8217;s letterhead at the top.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do anything rash if I were you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I froze in place. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Katie told me about you faking it to get off
from school so you wouldn&#8217;t get teased and how if your mom found out that you
weren&#8217;t really sick you&#8217;d be in for it when you got home.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah . . . so, what&#8217;s the paper?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It says that you are suffering from a stomach
virus and it excuses you from school for the next two days, that&#8217;s what it
says.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;How on earth . . . Did Doc write that? He
didn&#8217;t think I . . .&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No, I wrote it on his stationary and used his
signature stamp. So what&#8217;s this worth to you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I was dumbfounded. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I mean I went out on a limb for you here by
typing this. I could get into big trouble so I want to know what I get out of
this if I give it to you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any money. Ask Katie, she&#8217;ll tell
you. I&#8217;m broke.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh I don&#8217;t want any money.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I swallowed hard as I looked at the pair of
them. They were both grinning from ear to ear and that wasn&#8217;t a good omen. It&#8217;s
hard to negotiate when you&#8217;re naked. Just then Clarissa knocked on the door
telling us to hurry up as she really needed this room. &#8220;What . . . um . . .
what DO you want?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;How about I take you home just like my sister
told your mom that I would . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay deal!&#8221; I said quickly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Not so fast, sister. I wasn&#8217;t finished. How
about I take you home but we are going to do it MY way and I don&#8217;t want any
arguments from you. I want your complete cooperation. Work with me and I&#8217;ll
give you this paper.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I was devastated. I knew darn well that if I
agreed there was no telling what Lisa had in mind. I did know one thing
however, without that paper my hinny was going to really get it along with some
almost certain naked corner time.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa must have seen that I was struggling with
this so she spoke up, &#8220;And . . .&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And I&#8217;ll promise NOT to tease you at school and
I&#8217;ll even throw in that I&#8217;ll tell anyone I catch doing that to leave you alone.
How&#8217;s that sound?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Wow, that was really something to consider. I
certainly could use a free pass for a couple of days off from school and with
Lisa promising not to tease me and to get after those that did it was very
appealing. The letter would also get me off the hook with my mom too. Still, I
just didn&#8217;t trust Lisa. Everything I knew about her spelled trouble. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But I must point out that if you don&#8217;t agree
you&#8217;ll find your own way home and I&#8217;ll make your life a living hell &#8211; starting
with calling your mother to tell her you&#8217;re a phony.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Agreed. I let you take me home. Now can we
please get me something to wear so I can get out of here before Doc gets really
upset with me?&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Ahem . . . we&#8217;re doing this my way, remember?
You&#8217;re going as you are.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT?!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We can leave by the back door as my car is
parked out back. Now let&#8217;s go. I&#8217;m on a schedule here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;ve GOT to be kidding.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not and if you give me one more
outburst like that or argue with me trying to get me to change my mind the deal
is off. Now let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">She then opened the door and Katie ushered me
out holding one of my hands and Lisa held the other in full view of a now VERY
packed waiting room. Down the hall we went and exited the back door. It was a
frightening feeling being outside without any clothes at the mercy of those two
girls. Lisa had Katie and I sit in the back seat while she drove. The first
thing I did was to check to see if there was anything in the car that I could
use to cover myself in case of an emergency, but Lisa kept her car meticulously
clean. There wasn&#8217;t anything, anything at all.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I sat quietly in the back covering myself with
my hands as best I could. All those cars, I thought. A driver in any one of
them on the road could look over and see me. It WAS broad daylight after all. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As we drove along Lisa suddenly broke the
silence. &#8220;Annie, do you know what a Chinese Fire Drill is?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Um . . . no . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie interrupted to explain, &#8220;It&#8217;s where the
driver of a car suddenly stops the vehicle and yells CHINESE FIRE DRILL and the
passengers all get out and run around the back of the car exchanging seats with
the person that sat next to them. You have to do it very fast before the driver
pulls off and leaves you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Ah . . .
why are you asking me this?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa laughed out loud, &#8220;Because we are going to
do one.&#8221; For no apparent reason she suddenly stopped the car in the middle of
the road as the cars behind her were forced to do the same and yelled, &#8220;CHINESE
FIRE DRILL.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie was laughing her head off as she quickly
opened her door and jumped out. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;GO, GO, GO, GO!&#8221; Katie yelled as she exited the
car. My adrenalin was pumping furiously throughout my body as I suddenly found
myself opening my door and getting out of the vehicle! I couldn&#8217;t believe what
I was doing. I was naked in the middle of a public street with like maybe 10
cars stopped behind ours all looking at me as I ran around the back of Lisa&#8217;s
automobile. As I rounded the trunk I saw a really cute guy vigorously waving at
me which made me almost panic out of fear. Seeing Katie hop in her side of the
car and slam her door brought me back to reality and I started to move again
but it was too late. Lisa started driving off!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I screamed bloody murder and began running after
her car to the now very audible hoots and hollers of the other drivers! &#8220;STOP .
. . DON&#8217;T LEAVE ME,&#8221; I shouted as she crawled forward. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The people behind me got a great view of my
bruised rear end jiggling as I ran and the drivers in the oncoming traffic lane
saw my less than impressive chest not jiggling much at all!! I was mortified!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">After traveling maybe 150 feet Lisa stopped and
waited for me to catch up! I wasted no time in hopping inside and screamed at
her to get the hell out of there, which only made the two of them laugh
hysterically. She eventually started driving again to the sounds of a multitude
of honking horns! I was gasping to catch my breath I was so overcome with fear,
shock and embarrassment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That was wicked,&#8221; Lisa exclaimed excitedly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do that again sometime.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I was scrunched down in the backseat for several
minutes before Lisa insisted that I sit up. When I did the honking had all died
down and things seemed pretty normal again &#8211; except for the fact that Lisa and
Katie were still laughing their darned fool heads off.</span>

right for our school with me naked in the back seat!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa laughed, &#8220;I have to check-in at school. I
am only allowed at the doctor&#8217;s office during lunch and my regular Health
Careers class. I can&#8217;t just leave the office and go home after I&#8217;m done. I have
to turn in my signed attendance card each day after work otherwise the school
will think I skipped class or something.&#8221;</span>

not my fault. It had nothing to do with me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I immediately scrunched up into a ball as Lisa
pulled into the parking lot and began driving around in circles. &#8220;Look at all
these cars. I&#8217;ll NEVER find a parking space. I HATE it when I leave and some
idiot takes my parking place while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Being ever so careful I peeked over the door
ledge to see how many students were about but mercifully they were all in class
and the lot seemed deserted as far as classmates were concerned. Lisa finally
found a spot 4 rows back from the school building sandwiched between two cars.
At least she didn&#8217;t just pull up next to the sidewalk and run inside leaving me
practically out in the open.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

going to run in and drop off your attendance card?&#8221;</span>

attend before school is out, silly. I told you at the Doctor&#8217;s office that I
was on a tight schedule. You&#8217;ll be fine here. I&#8217;ll be back as soon as I can and
then we can leave.&#8221; With that she got out of the car and began heading towards
the school buildings. </span>

off that body of yours, don&#8217;t you? Do you realize that the entire freshman
class is sitting in various rooms not 200 feet from where we are and here you
sit totally naked? What&#8217;s it feel like knowing that you might just be seen
totally bare by the entire school?&#8221;</span>

yelling out the car window.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie rolled down her window and stuck her head
outside. &#8220;Tell me that I&#8217;m prettier than you and that you wish you could be
like me.&#8221;</span>

thing.&#8221;</span>

NAKED!! COME AND LOOK!&#8221; she screamed at the top of her lungs out the window.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As she took another deep breath to yell again I
quickly said, &#8220;You&#8217;re prettier than me and I wish I could be like you.&#8221; It was
a good thing our school was made out of concrete block and double insulated
windows. I was pretty certain that nobody had heard her, but I couldn&#8217;t be
sure.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hear you very well. Did you mumble
something?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I said you&#8217;re prettier than me and I wish I
could be just like you.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie giggled with satisfaction and pulled her
head back into the window. She persisted in making crude comments about my body
and about how awkward I was around boys. She could easily carry on a
conversation with any boy about any subject. I, on the other hand, seemed to
choke on my words if I ever had to talk a guy. I seemed to get all
self-conscious and unable to get the words out.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t that Billy Thompson walking to the
office?&#8221; she asked pointing to a boy carrying a folder of papers. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
like him?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s not funny, Katie. Don&#8217;t you DARE . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What . . . here&#8217;s your chance to get to know
him better. The school Sadie Hawkins dance is coming up and I know for a fact
that you don&#8217;t have a date. Should I call him over so you can ask him? I wonder
what he&#8217;d think if he saw what you really look like without clothes. Do you
think he&#8217;d like what he saw?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Oh god

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I think I should. After all it&#8217;s an older
sister&#8217;s prerogative to look after her younger sibling. The way I look at it
I&#8217;d be doing you a favor.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;How about I do you a favor instead and do your
homework tomorrow?&#8221;</span>

it?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah, maybe for the rest of the week . . .
please don&#8217;t call Billy over here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay that&#8217;s it? No tricks?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No,&#8221; she said playfully, &#8220;would I do that to
you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I just sat there as she stared at me. &#8220;Still,
wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to let him see what you look like? The way you seem to like
running around naked all the time I thought you&#8217;d jump at the chance. It might
improve your popularity around campus you know.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No thanks. I&#8217;m fine just as I am.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">After listening to my step-sister&#8217;s taunts for
what seemed like forever, I finally saw Lisa coming out of one of the buildings
and heading towards the car. &#8220;Thank goodness,&#8221; I said under my breath. &#8220;At
least we can get out of here now before the final bell rings.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;RIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG,&#8221; the final bell
sounded ending the regular school day. Kids began exiting all the buildings and
scattering all over the campus and here I was sitting in the parking lot
without a stitch to cover myself. I wanted to scream for Lisa to hurry the hell
up before I was seen but I was too afraid that somebody I knew would hear me
and come over to say hi.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa got within 5 feet of her vehicle when
somebody called out to her and she stopped to talk. It was some boy she knew
and there they stood chatting &#8211; close enough that if the boy looked over he&#8217;d
see me for sure! I don&#8217;t think my heart beat once during the entire time they
were gabbing. He finally went about his business and Lisa climbed in the car
and put her keys in the ignition! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Students were EVERYWHERE meandering among all
the parked cars! It was only a matter of time before someone came to get into
one of the vehicles next to ours and spot me! The news would be all over school
&#8211; &#8220;Annie Swanson streaks school!&#8221; I was beginning to panic. My gut told me to
run but my body was frozen with fear. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Did you miss me?&#8221; Lisa teased as she began
backing the car up out of her spot. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">We were finally out of the parking lot and stuck
at the traffic light about a block from the school. So far so good, I thought.
I had done the impossible and managed to be naked on campus for more than an
hour without being seen. It was kind of thrilling in a way, but not something
I&#8217;d ever want to do again! EVER!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Then Lisa screwed the whole thing by yelling,&#8221;
CHINESE FIRE DRILL!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;GO,GO,GO,GO!&#8221; Katie said as she opened her door
excitedly. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Survival instinct took over along with the fight
or flight of the adrenalin rush I just experienced because of all the yelling
and I got out of my side of the car, ran around back totally naked but hiding
my face as much as I could as several cars honked their horns indicating that I
was indeed seen. I jumped in the opposite side of Lisa&#8217;s car before she had the
chance to drive off! What a RUSH!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As we sped away from the school, Lisa kept complimenting
me on how much she admired my courage and that she thought I was much more fun
than my step-sister. Hearing what she said made me swell up with pride. The
popular bitch actually liked me! Who would have thought?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When we pulled into our driveway Lisa thanked me
for a fun day. I nervously looked around to make sure that mom wasn&#8217;t home yet
but there was no sign of her. Still I had to make that long trek to our front
door naked during which any one of my neighbors could spot me and they would be
only too happy to report me to my step-mother.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget these,&#8221; Katie said reaching under
the back seat and pulling out my clothes.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What the . . . YOU stole my clothes??&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie just laughed and said, &#8220;Yeah, I couldn&#8217;t
resist.&#8221;</span>

:&#8221;You owe me an apology.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I apologized, reluctantly, but I did do the
right thing and admit to her that I was wrong as I slipped into my outfit
before going inside. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When my step-mom finally came home she bellowed
for me to come downstairs. She wanted to know what Doc had said. I could tell
by the expression on her face that she was ready to dish it out &#8211; so sure was
she that I was faking it. I handed her the note and her demeanor changed
instantly and she began comforting me and apologizing for doubting me. She even
made me a special dinner in the hopes that I&#8217;d feel better. Like I said she
really was a nice person and I knew that deep down she had my best interest at
heart most of the time.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The next morning as I was lying in bed I
realized that I had two days of excused absences from school. I should have
been overjoyed but I wasn&#8217;t. My conscience was rearing its ugly head and I felt
terrible. My mom was clearly concerned for me and was being so nice that my
guilt was getting to me. It was all a lie! The more I thought about it the more
I hated myself for trying to pull this off. I really felt bad, almost sick, in
fact.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I got up and got dressed. Something inside of me
was demanding that I do the right thing. I had just finished putting on my
shoes when my step-mom came into the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What are you doing, Annie, Dr. Henderson said
you needed to stay home from school for two days. Now get back in bed.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Tears began welling up in my eyes. &#8220;Oh mom, I&#8217;m
so sorry.&#8221; She looked at me with a confused expression and I could tell she was
about to say something comforting. &#8220;Mom, it&#8217;s all a lie. I can&#8217;t do this, I&#8217;m
so sorry. I really am. I lied to you yesterday.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Then it all came pouring out. The more I talked
the better I felt &#8211; almost like vomiting when you are sick to your stomach &#8211;
it&#8217;s horrible as it is happening, but you feel better after it&#8217;s over. I told
her everything &#8211; about how I wasn&#8217;t really sick and was just afraid to go to
school because of the teasing and about how Lisa forged the note using Doc&#8217;s
signature stamp, about the Chinese Fire Drills I had to do &#8211; everything. I told
her that even though I knew the note was a fake, I still tried to make her
believe it was true last night anyway and that I felt really bad about
deceiving her.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I talked I could see her face getting redder
by the minute. She was angry and I could tell she was doing her best to keep it
all in. She let me finish and then started to storm out of the room but
stopped. &#8220;I&#8217;m SO disappointed, Annie. You have no idea. There&#8217;s definitely
going to be a punishment tonight the likes of which this house has never seen
before!&#8221; She then stormed out of the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Even though I dreaded the punishment, I really
deserved it after all. Maybe it was a sign that I was indeed growing up that I
actually owned up to my mistake rather than hide it. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The day passed slowly as all I could think about
was how I was going to be punished. It seemed that each time I was punished it
got worse and much more humiliating for me. I had really screwed up this time &#8211;
worse than I had ever done before so like my step-mother said that morning, the
punishment will be so bad the likes of which had never been seen in our house
before. I shuddered every time I thought about it.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When school was over I told my mom when she came
to pick me up that I wanted to walk home. She pursed her lips and I could tell
she wasn&#8217;t thrilled with my request but she gave me permission but cautioned me
that I had better not be late.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">On the walk home I felt like a condemned
prisoner. My life would surely be over after this. I just knew it. Still,
something inside of me let me know that this was the right thing to do. I made
a bad decision so I had to take the consequences. Maybe I was finally learning
from my mistakes!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I rounded the corner of my street and my
house came into view, I almost passed out. There were cars lining both sides of
the street and many of them were even parked on our front lawn!! My step-mother
invited all these people to witness my punishment?! How could she?! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I got closer I recognized several members of
the high school football team getting out of a car and going into my house!
Then I saw old Doc Henderson going up to our front door as well. Oh my Gawd!
Half the town must be here. They were all going to see me naked and watch me get
my butt roasted! It was all too humiliating to even think about! As I stood in
front of my house I saw several of my classmates waving at me through the front
window. My legs began shaking and my mouth got severely dry. I knew my
punishment was going to be bad but I never imagined it like this!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I swallowed hard and using all my courage I went
up to the door and entered the house. Everyone was either sitting or standing
all around the front room and they all seemed pleased and excited that I was
finally home.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My step-mother finally saw me and just said
firmly, &#8220;SIT!&#8221; as she pointed to an empty chair along the wall. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Sit?? I thought to myself. That was different. I
meekly sat down as instructed and awaited for the bomb to go off. My mom
signaled for everyone to be quiet. When the room was eerily silent I got the
shock of my life!!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Katie . . . Lisa, it&#8217;s time.&#8221; My step-mother
called upstairs in that now all too familiar sickeningly sweet voice.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie? Lisa? What the hell was going on? I
didn&#8217;t have to wait long to find out. Ever so slowly down the stairs came my
step-sister and her friend wearing see through tops like the one I used to wear
and both girls were sporting kiddie panties as well! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As I looked around the room it dawned on me that
most of these people were either friends or parents of students that were in
Lisa&#8217;s class or friends and students in my class that were also classmates of
my step-sister, Katie as well. They were all people that were important to
Katie and Lisa!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My mom went on to explain what Katie had done to
me, how they humiliated me by taking me to school naked and doing absurd things
like hiding my clothes and making me do Chinese Fire Drills on public streets.
As if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough she had old Doc Henderson get up and explain how
Lisa had forged a doctor&#8217;s excuse using his stationery and signature stamp &#8211; a
very serious offense indeed. He explained that under normal circumstances he
would have reported the matter to the police and to the school and almost
assuredly she would have been expelled, but, that he agreed to forgo that
action as Lisa&#8217;s mother had agreed to having her punished the same way Katie
was about to be dealt with. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Lisa looked scared to death &#8211; her face was ashen
and her legs trembling even worse than mine had been. It was clear that she had
no idea what was in store for her but after seeing what had happened to me she
wanted no part of it. But that wasn&#8217;t for her to decide. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">My step-mom then said, &#8220;Since these girls
obviously take great delight in stripping and forcing others to be naked in
public I think they have forfeited the right to wear anything for their
punishment this evening. Once again she then produced a pair of scissors and
began cutting on the bottom of Lisa&#8217;s top. Lisa was mortified as she realized
that at any minute her chest was going to be on display for the entire room!
Before I could even get that thought clear in my head my step-mother had it off
and forced Lisa to stand there in just her Sponge-Bob cartoon panties that
said, &#8220;It&#8217;s fun to be wet!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie was next and she buried her head in her
hands as her mother destroyed her top as well. The panties were next to go and
I took great delight in making no secret that I was loving every minute of
this!! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The students in the room were totally shocked.
Like those seeing my punishments, they had no idea what was going to happen. I
suspected that they just thought they&#8217;d get to see a spanking or some good
old-fashioned yelling. THIS was a surprise to all of them!! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As bad as it was being forced to be stripped in
front of everyone - that was nothing to what my mother said next. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;After talking with Lisa&#8217;s parents and Dr.
Henderson I&#8217;ve decided that each girl will receive FIVE slaps with the bare
hand.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">That&#8217;s all?! Five slaps! That&#8217;s ridiculous. I
ALWAYS received way more than that. Why that would hardly even leave a mark!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">I saw both Katie and Lisa simultaneously let out
a huge sigh of relief. But they didn&#8217;t know my step-mom as well as I did.
&#8220;That&#8217;s FIVE slaps with the bare hand FROM EACH AND EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT . . . YOU CAN&#8217;T BE SERIOUS!&#8221; Katie
protested loudly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh but I am. And what&#8217;s more, these will be
given <b style="">over-the-knee</b> by each person
here.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">There were over 30 people in the room - that was
over 150 slaps each!! I almost squealed with delight I was so elated, but I was
stopped when I heard my mother calling my name. &#8220;Annie . . .&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am?&#8221; I replied with my voice quivering &#8211;
worried that I was about to receive the same punishment for lying to her.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Since YOU were the one they tormented, YOU get
to give the first whacks, followed by Doc Henderson.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;YES MA&#8217;AM!&#8221; I exclaimed excitedly! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Katie was made to lie over my lap and I
purposely used my foot to brace her in place by placing it between each of her
legs &#8211; the result was a pelvis that was spread wide-open leaving no secrets as
to her intimate place! EVERYONE was looking and laughing. I gave Katie 5 of the
hardest slaps I could muster and did the same with Lisa. IT FELT GREAT!! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When old Doc Henderson was through, mom directed
Katie to bend over the lap of one of the football players!! She turned red as a
tomato!! The player gently used his hand to rub her butt playfully and said,
&#8220;It feels warm already!&#8221; His comment made everyone in the room laugh
hysterically.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Person after person, young, old, male, female
all took their turns paddling the hind ends of the two shamed girls. Each
person giving the licks seemed to enjoy it more than the person before them
often resulting in cheers and hollering from the observers.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When each girl had received the required number
of licks my step-mom made them both turn around so everyone could see how red
their butts were and then made them apologize to each person in the room &#8211; one
at a time! </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie . . .&#8221; my step-mom said finally. &#8220;I want
you to keep track of the time for me.&#8221; She then stood each girl in the center
of the room facing the large open window and said, &#8220;TWO HOURS REFLECTION TIME.&#8221;
She made them put their hands on their heads and reminded not to move or say a
