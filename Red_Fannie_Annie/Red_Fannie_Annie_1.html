<i style="">14 year old Annie&#8217;s step-mother learns

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
had just walked in the door from early
dismissal from school when my step-mother shouted at me from the living
room, &#8220;Annie,
you march yourself upstairs and get ready for your punishment. Three
o&#8217;clock
young lady, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ve decided your punishment will be given,
three
o&#8217;clock.&#8221; She then pointed menacingly towards the stairs.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;BUT
MOM . . . I haven&#8217;t done anything! I just
got home!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Without
saying a word she held up the letter I
had written to Billy Edwards, a boy in my class that I really liked
agreeing to
meet him at the movies for a date on Saturday. I was forbidden by my
mother to
date until I was at least 15 and then only with her approval and
oversight. I
had hidden the note in my underwear drawer in the hopes that she
wouldn&#8217;t find
it. In retrospect I guess that wasn&#8217;t such a great place to put it as
it made
me look all the more guilty.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Upon
seeing her holding my letter my heart sank.
&#8220;Oh . . .&#8221; I replied meekly looking at the ground. If she only knew how
many
times I had hung out with Billy alone at the park she&#8217;d kill me. &#8220;But
mom, I
was just pretending, you know, imagining what it would be like to go
out on a
date. Billy never really asked me out and anyway, besides I&#8217;d never do
such a
thing. I was fantasizing that&#8217;s all. You know I wouldn&#8217;t disobey you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
know no such thing young lady and just to
make sure that you know that I mean what I say you&#8217;re going to get
punished.
I&#8217;ll not tolerate such a flagrant disregard for my rules in this house.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;THAT&#8217;S
NOT FAIR! I didn&#8217;t DO anything!&#8221; I said
screaming at the top of my lungs with all the emotional protest I could
muster.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;For
talking back and arguing with me you&#8217;ll get
20 extra plus another half hour of corner time added to your usual. Now
get
upstairs and get ready.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
was no use in arguing as it would only
make things worse for me and I&#8217;d never win anyway. I stomped my way
upstairs
and entered my room. I started to slam my door in anger but at the last
moment
I thought better of it fearing what my mother would do if I did and
decided to
close it gently.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
loved my dad to death but I couldn&#8217;t believe
when he announced that he was going to marry again after my mother
died. My
step-mother almost immediately insisted that I call her &#8220;mom&#8221; from the
first
day that I met her, which only resulted in me hating her for it. She
wasn&#8217;t bad
really. In fact, in most ways was a very congenial person. She was well
liked
in the community and seemed to have an endless supply of friends. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Still,
she had very arcane ideas about
discipline &#8211; ultra-strict in fact. I had never been spanked before
until Miss
Alice, the name I used to call my step-mother before she insisted on
&#8220;mom,&#8221;
came into my life. My dad went along with her demands that I be treated
no
different than her natural daughter. I could see how important she was
to him
and I wanted to make things work &#8211; more for his sake than my own. When
I was
12, the spankings started. Okay, I&#8217;ll admit I deserved most of them. My
dad
said that I was just pushing the boundaries to see what I could get
away with
and discipline wasn&#8217;t something he was good at &#8211; especially for his
&#8220;little
girl&#8221; so he left that in the hands of his new bride. He didn&#8217;t want me
to turn
out to be a spoiled brat and that a little structure would be good for
me at
this time in my life with all the changes going on.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Things
got worse when daddy&#8217;s company put him on
the road a lot. The job paid more because of the travel but that meant
I lost
my most valuable ally at home during desperate times. Whenever I
complained on
the phone about how I was being punished he always pleaded with me to
just
accept her decisions and try to get along &#8211; that I would be doing it
for him. I
loved him so much I usually would give in and accept my chastisement.
That
didn&#8217;t mean that I was a good teenager by any means as I was usually
angry all
the time complaining about how unfair life was and about how I looked.
I whined
about my clothes and about not being able to wear what the cool kids
were
wearing &#8211; stuff like that. I was at that awkward age and puberty was
terribly slow
in completing my metamorphosis from a child to a woman.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
I turned 14 spankings evolved into a
bizarre ritual. My step-mother seemed to think that mere spankings were
having
little effect on my behavior. My dad told her that drama was just part
of an
influx of hormones at my age. I just thought she was just crazy and
unfair. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Before
my spankings she would send me to my room
to think about what I had done. Knowing what was coming and having to
wait for
it was stressful. But that wasn&#8217;t bad enough. Spankings then went from
old-fashioned hand spankings to ones delivered with a strap. Then the
pain
factor increased exponentially when she decided that they should also
be given
on the bare behind. Strap on skin hurt a lot more than leather on a
pair of blue
jeans. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
she added a little humiliation to the mix.
She came up with the idea of a punishment outfit that I had to change
into
before my sentence was carried out. Waiting in my room in that outfit
really
put me in my place. But the last straw as far as I was concerned was
when she
allowed my step-sister Katie to watch. On paper she was a year older
than me
and nature had been really kind to her in the boob department. She had
perfect
skin, a face that had &#8220;cute&#8221; written all over it and was probably one
of the
most popular girls at my high school. She had way more privileges than
me &#8211;
ostensibly because she was older &#8211; but only by 5 months! I hated her
for it too
and she knew it. She was always rubbing it in my face about how much
more
mature she was than me. Having her watch me get punished was so
humiliating.
She taunted me about it too. Oh, and lets not forget the corner time &#8211;
time
spent after my whipping standing in the corner with my panties down at
my
ankles and my red bottom on display for Katie to make fun of. It was
usually
only a half hour but today I just earned another 30 minutes so I&#8217;d have
to
stand still, bare-bottomed like for an HOUR! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">They
say bad news travels fast and today was no
exception. Katie came bounding into my room all smiles, &#8220;Someone&#8217;s
getting a
whippin&#8217; . . . someone&#8217;s getting a whippin&#8217;.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">For
someone who bragged about being so mature
she sure didn&#8217;t act like it.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Shut
up. Why don&#8217;t you crawl up under a rock
and die.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katie
sighed playfully. &#8220;Some people just never
learn. I used to be like you but I have long since grown into a mature
woman.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Stop
making yourself out to be an adult. You&#8217;re
only a few months older than me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah,
well who&#8217;s getting a whippin&#8217; and who
gets to watch, hmmm?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
was hopeless to debate the issue with her.
The more I talked the more ammunition she had to ridicule me. Instead I
just
pretended that she wasn&#8217;t even there and sulked on my bed. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
listening to a few more insults and
pointed jabs at my character my step-sister grew bored and left. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
punishment outfit consisted of a Navy Blue
T-shirt and a pair of panties. The T-shirt stopped about one inch down
below my
butt. After my paddling I was made to stand in the corner facing the
wall while
holding my shirt above my backside exposing my shame to my family. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
three o&#8217;clock came around my step-mother
called up to me with the simple phrase, &#8220;Annie, it&#8217;s time.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
slowly made my way down the stairs into the
front room where I had to stand and listen to a lecture about my
misdeeds and
how my mom hated to punish me but that I left her no choice; that as a
responsible parent she HAD to do this, blah, blah, blah.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
she verbally berated me I was told to bend
over the arm of a chair in the middle of the room. Mom then lowered my
panties
much to Katie&#8217;s obvious delight and began strapping my behind counting
out each
stroke. Normally I would receive 15 strokes for minor infractions and
20 for
something really bad. I knew that I already had 20 extra strokes coming
but I
didn&#8217;t know if I would start with as she never said and I knew better
than to
ask.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mom
would start lightly at first but as she
neared the end her strokes would be really very painful. Today I was
lucky &#8211; 15
regular strokes followed, then by 10 medium strokes and finally by 10
incredibly hard ones. My butt felt on fire when she was through. The
fact that
my step-sister laughed through the whole thing made my suffering even
worse. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
mom let me up I had to waddle to the corner
of the room with my panties at my ankles, face the wall and then hold
up my
shirt &#8211; today for one hour. I was always afraid that somebody might
come over
but no one ever did. Still it was the fear that it might happen that
scared me
to death. Today, however, all that changed. After I had served about 45
minutes
of my corner time there was a knock at the door. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
panicked! That had never happened before. I
quickly bent down to pull up my panties and started for the hallway to
get out
of sight. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Where
do you think you&#8217;re going?&#8221; my mom asked
sternly. &#8216;You&#8217;re not finished with your corner time yet. Get back where
you
belong!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;BUT
MOM . . . You don&#8217;t really expect me to
stand there showing my butt to a stranger do you?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;MARCH,&#8221;
she commanded pointing to the corner.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You
CAN&#8217;T BE SERIOUS?! &#8220;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Would
you rather I whipped your ass again while
they watched?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
face about hit the floor and my legs began
visibly shaking! That was a mistake. I could see in my mother&#8217;s eyes
that she
now knew my biggest fear &#8211; that someone would see me!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
tried to take a step but I found that I
couldn&#8217;t move at first. My legs were like jelly. Just then there was a
second
knock at the door, this one louder than the first. &#8220;You have two
seconds to get
back in that corner, young lady.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">No
need for a second warning. I was there
holding my shirt up in one second. I could tell from the tone in her
voice she
was serious. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
body was shaking all the more now, like it
was freezing in the room. I couldn&#8217;t help it. I was about to expose my
red,
naked behind to some unknown person. There was no way whoever it was
could miss
seeing me. The corner that I was standing in would be in view as soon
as the
front door was opened even a crack! There was no hope that she would
open it
just a little to spare me my shame. Once it was open, they&#8217;d see me! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
heard my mom&#8217;s hand turn the deadbolt to
unlock the door. &#8220;Mom,&#8221; I whimpered, &#8220;please . . .?&#8221;</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
plea was ignored as the sound of the door
opening confirmed. &#8220;Package for a Mrs. Alice Swanson,&#8221; a man&#8217;s voice
said
followed by an audible gasp that made me want to die. He had seen me!
At least
it wasn&#8217;t anyone that I knew! It was only the UPS guy &#8211; but a MAN had
seen my
BUTT!!! &#8220;Sorry, he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt.&#8221; His apology only
made my
humiliation worse &#8211; much worse. I knew that HE knew that he was looking
at me
and realized that he shouldn&#8217;t be.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s
quite alright,&#8221; my mom said with a
certain amusement in her voice. &#8220;My daughter just learned one of life&#8217;s
little
lessons.&#8221; I heard the man make a nervous laugh confirming that he had
to be
still staring right at my naked backside. My mom then asked him where
she
needed to sign. &#8220;Um . . . right here, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I heard some scribbling
followed
by the man thanking her and my mom bidding him good-bye. The whole
thing lasted
only a minute or two but it seemed liked a lifetime to me. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
the door closed I wanted to faint
dead-away. My mom just began humming gleefully as she passed me by
examining
the package she had just received. She NEVER hummed or whistled a tune
&#8211; not in
all the time I had known her, anyway. I think her humming was what
worried me
more than the UPS guy. Things could only get worse.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Needless
to say I was on my guard the next
several days and tried to stay out of trouble which wasn&#8217;t that easy
for me as
my temper was my biggest downfall. For the last several months even
little
things seemed to cause an outbreak of anger or make me say things that
I&#8217;d
regret. Curse words that I&#8217;d never used seemed to blurt out of my mouth
at the
worst possible times. Given what had happened with the UPS guy I was
determined
to avoid a repeat of that performance. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
worked, at first. Even my step-mother seemed
to notice an improvement in all the drama around the house and made a
point to
say so. Alas, changing a leopard&#8217;s spots isn&#8217;t an easy thing to do and
it
wasn&#8217;t long before I found myself in an argument with my step-sister
Katie over
something stupid. I called her an &#8220;F***ing Bitch&#8221; just as my mother
rounded the
corner. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ANNIE

just call your sister?&#8221;</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
could literally see the glee in Katie&#8217;s eyes
as she knew I was in big trouble this time. Always the helpful one she
spoke
up, &#8220;She called me a . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NEVERMIND,
I heard what she said. We don&#8217;t use
such language in this house! Annie, you march yourself up to your room
this
instant. You have one hour to think about what you&#8217;ve done. Now MOVE!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
skulked out of the room and meekly headed up
the stairs mentally kicking myself the whole time. How could I have
been so
stupid?</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
threw myself on my bed and sulked. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then Katie came bounding into my room all
smiles and holding a bag.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What
do YOU want?&#8221; I snapped flippantly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Is
that any way to talk to someone who&#8217;s
bringing you a gift?&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
don&#8217;t need anything from you. Now scram.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
but you DO, little sister. Mom told me to
give this to you. It&#8217;s your new punishment outfit.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What
. . . new outfit?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katie
snickered as she handed me the bag. &#8220;Mom
said it was time for a new outfit and she let me pick it out. Make sure
you
wear this when you come down.&#8221; She laughed out loud and then left the
room. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
opened the bag and pulled out the shirt and
panties. The panties were a light green color, all cotton briefs with
teddy
bears plastered all over them. They looked so juvenile! It figured
they&#8217;d be
something embarrassing as my step-sister picked them out. I decided to
just get
it over with and put the new outfit on. After shutting my door I
stripped off
my clothes and put on the panties. They were a least a size too small
and my
vulva was clearly outlined in the cotton fabric as a result. They were
hideous!
I took the shirt from the package and slipped it over my head and
almost died.
The shirt was almost totally transparent! It was made out of a delicate
white
almost sheer-like material that fit tightly against my chest &#8211; it too
seemed to
be a size or two too small. My small boobs and more importantly my
nipples were
easily seen!! To make matters worse, the shirt only came down to just a
couple
of inches above my belly button leaving it exposed as well as ALL of my
embarrassing panties! If I got corner time, I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry
about
holding anything up, that&#8217;s for sure. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
ran to my door and yelled downstairs, &#8220;MOM! I
can&#8217;t wear this! &#8220;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;STOP
YOUR WHINING AND DO AS YOUR TOLD, YOUNG
LADY. DO YOU HEAR ME?&#8221; she shouted back up at me from somewhere below.
Any hope
of this being some crude joke on Katie&#8217;s part was dashed by her
response. This
outfit was clearly designed to serve only one purpose &#8211; to humiliate
me. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once
again I threw myself on the bed and
continued to sulk. I could only imagine the fun my step-sister would
have
tormenting me in this outfit. I couldn&#8217;t believe mom would do that to
me and
let that spoiled brat pick this out!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All
too soon came the familiar, &#8220;Annie, it&#8217;s
time.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
reluctantly made my way down the stairs. This
outfit was horrible! I was already ashamed of my small underdeveloped
chest and
usually did my best to hide how I looked by wearing loose tops. Now
that brat
Katie would be able to see it all and mock me. She and her C-cup boobs!
I
wasn&#8217;t even what I&#8217;d call a good A-cup yet. This was going to be
horrible. I
just knew it.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
I heard voices coming from below &#8211; not my
family&#8217;s voices but those of others I couldn&#8217;t quite make out. We had
company!
I stood frozen on the steps not sure what to do. Surly my mom wouldn&#8217;t
punish
me when company was over. I started to turn around and head back to my
room
when I heard her calling again, this time in a sickly sweet voice,
&#8220;Annie, it&#8217;s
time.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Seriously?
She was going to punish with people
over?! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ANNIE
MARIE SWANSON YOU GET YOUR LITTLE BUTT
DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
tone in her voice left no doubt that I was
trying her patience. &#8220;Yes, mom&#8221; I replied with my voice quivering. I
raised my
arms to hide my chest and unwillingly continued my journey. As I
rounded the
corner of the staircase I saw my neighbor Mrs. Hansen and her 10 year
old son
sitting on the couch smiling at me. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
step-mom came over and took hold of my hand
and dragged me to the center of the room and made me stand with my
hands by my
side. I was so humiliated watching my neighbors look me over. &#8220;Annie,
you know
Caroline and her son from next door. Well they just happened to pop
over for a
quick visit before going to town. I told them that you were going to be
punished and she thought it might be a good lesson for her son to see
what
happens to children who are disobedient. He thinks he&#8217;s too old for
spankings.
I said that you were older than he was and still got spanked. What do
you
think, dear, are you too old?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
lowered my head in shame. How could I be too
old for a spanking standing there in my teddy bear kiddie panties? &#8220;Ah,
no
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I replied meekly still looking at the floor.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
rest of her lecture was a blur and basically
pure babble as I wasn&#8217;t listening to a word. Oh she prattled on about
my
name-calling and junk and the usual how she hated to do this, blah,
blah, blah
again. All I could think about was that this boy was looking at my
chest and
how at any minute they both would see my naked butt and the shame of my
paddling! I wanted to die. I looked over at Katie looking at my body
with a
huge evil grin on her face and then I wanted HER to die! She made a
point to
cup her breasts with her hands and push up on her boobs a couple of
times
making them jiggle just to mock me. It worked too as I felt so
inadequate at
that moment knowing that everyone on the room could see what I had &#8211;
despite
the fact that I was supposedly covered and decent by wearing this poor
excuse
for a top. It wasn&#8217;t lost on me, staring at my step-sister, that SHE
was the
one who picked this outfit out for me to wear. I loathed her.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was snatched back to reality when my mom
jerked my hand, &#8220;Annie, you heard me, turn around and face the window.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;
Was she saying something to me? &#8220;Turn
around . . . but, what about the chair?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom pointed out that Katie was sitting in it
so that she would just have to improvise. She then turned me around so
that my
rear end faced the two visitors about three feet away on the couch,
bent me
over at the waist and began removing my panties! She didn&#8217;t yank them
down
either. It was a slow, methodical stripping. She put her fingers into
the
elastic waistband and ran her fingers from side to side as if the
material was
somehow magically stuck to my skin and she had to loosen it before
proceeding.
Feeling her fingers above my cheeks sent a shiver up my spine. She was
dragging
this out on purpose. Even I could feel the tension in the room as
everyone
waited for what was sure to come. She then lowered my panties exposing
my cleft
between my cheeks and stopped about half way down my butt pausing long
enough to
explain that she felt spanking on the bare skin was a much more
effective way
to drive home the point that this was supposed to remind me of my
place. The
delay only made the whole experience much worse. I would have rather
she&#8217;d
quickly done the deed and got it over with.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
couldn&#8217;t believe it. She couldn&#8217;t have picked
a worse position to punish me in. It was bad enough that they were
going to see
me crying and getting strapped but did they have to get an up close and
personal view of my private place? The cool air of the room that hit my
skin as
my panties were ever so slowly lowered immediately enhanced the
difference
between what part of me was exposed and what part was still covered.
Finally
they were on the floor. I heard the little snot of a boy behind me
giggle when
my intimate spot was revealed only to be hushed by his mother. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">15
swats was delivered fast and furious, so hard
that they made such a &#8220;slapping&#8221; sound when the leather hit my skin
that it
almost took my breath away. Needless to say I wasn&#8217;t merely whimpering
as I
usually did, I was bawling my head off. But the discomfort didn&#8217;t
really
matter. No, what bothered me the most was that a BOY was seeing me
half-naked
AND watching my humiliation. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;30
minutes corner time,&#8221; my mom announced when
she was through and directed me to my usual place against the wall.
Shuffling
over to the wall with my panties gathered up around my feet made me
look
ridiculous. I heard that little snot of a boy start giggling again as I
stood
there with my nose to the wall only this time his mother didn&#8217;t
reprimand him. &#8220;Hands
on your head,&#8221; my step-mom called out, which had the effect of raising
my shirt
even higher up my back adding to my embarrassment.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Our
neighbors continued visiting for some time
longer as Mrs. Hansen told her son that she was going to start doing
the same
thing to him if he didn&#8217;t straighten up. My mom joined in extolling the
virtues
of the strap and the two ladies seemed to relish the conversation all
the while
I was baring it all in my corner! I felt like such a dork standing
there with
my panties gathered up around my ankles. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally
they left and soon afterward my time was
up and I returned to my room. The look in Katie&#8217;s eyes was so gleeful
that I
knew I hadn&#8217;t heard the last of this. It turns out that I was right.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">For
the next week or so I was very careful not
to earn a repeat of my punishment. Katie teased me daily about how
shocked she
was at how much I still looked like a little kid and about how red my
butt was
that day as I stood in the corner. She never missed an opportunity to
rub it
in. Even though she did her best to goad me into a fight I resisted her
temptation and just pretended that it didn&#8217;t bother me at all. It did
of
course, but I dared not fall into her trap.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
the days progressed that awful memory soon
faded and I went back to being the old moody, self-absorbed person that
I was.
One day our school announced that the Letterman&#8217;s club was selling
special
spirit T-shirts with our team logo on Friday only. I wanted one so very
badly.
I had some money saved but I was still $5 short. I decided to borrow
five one
dollar bills from the cookie jar in the kitchen that mom kept her spare
cash
in. I had done that before and always replaced what I had taken. Well,
almost
always . . . okay, I did once but I meant to repay what I had taken the
other
times. I guess I looked at it as a short term loan. I had no intention
of
stealing the cash this time and planned on replacing it with my
allowance that
I got on Saturday. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
shirt was fabulous! I really loved the color
and the design but the best part was that since the sale was for only
one day
not many kids had them so I felt &#8220;cool&#8221; and popular for a change since
I had
managed to get one. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
wore the shirt home and mom immediately asked
me where it came from. I explained that I bought it with money that I
had
saved. She seemed pleased that I had used my own money for it rather
than
begging her to buy it for me and she said so. She looked the shirt over
and
commented on how nice it looked on me and remarked on how proud she was
that I
had gotten it on my own and that it was a sign of how mature I was
becoming. It
was one of those happy parent-daughter moments that she was good at.
Like I
said before, she was really a congenial person most of the time.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
next day, Saturday, I was sitting in my room
after breakfast listening to tunes on my <i style="">i</i>-Pod
when my step-mom burst into my room holding my new school T-shirt in
one hand.
I immediately took the ear-buds out of my ears and turned off my music.
</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Tell
me again, Annie, how did you get this
shirt?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Swallowing
hard I replied, &#8220;I bought it with my
own money that I saved.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie
. . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
did. I used the money I&#8217;ve been saving for
the last two weeks.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie
. . .&#8221; she said again as if she didn&#8217;t
believe me and was waiting for me to change my story. She then pulled
out the
cookie jar from behind her back and waved it at me. &#8220;Are you lying to
me?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
no ma&#8217;am, I used most of my money I
swear. It cost $30. I had most of it but was $5 short so I borrowed $5
yesterday and was going to repay it after I got my allowance this
morning.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;So
you admit you STOLE $5 from me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No!
I borrowed it. I was going to put it back,
honest.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Taking
something that doesn&#8217;t belong to you
without permission is STEALING not BORROWING. I can&#8217;t believe you!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, mom. I should have asked first but
you weren&#8217;t around and II had to get to school. They were only selling
. . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
cut me off before I could finish explaining.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, you should have ASKED first. You should ALWAYS ASK
before just
taking things &#8211; something you&#8217;ll soon learn.&#8221; She tossed my new shirt
at me and
it landed on my head. As I pulled it off she continued, &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
punished at
noon today young lady &#8211; high noon.&#8221; She chuckled at her western cliché.
&#8220;Wear
that shirt down since you wanted it so badly that you had to STEAL to
get it.
And, wear your punishment panties like normal. Until then, get changed
like I
said and sit up here and THINK about what you just did.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
left the room in a huff. Great &#8211; three whole
hours to dwell on my punishment. I wished my dad was here.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
did feel bad that I had disappointed her after
she was so proud of me yesterday. Leave it to me to screw up a good
thing. I
guess she was right, though. I really should have asked first. It was a
good
thing that she hadn&#8217;t asked me if I had ever done something like that
before. I
really would have lowered her opinion of me if she had. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Around
9:30, I heard a car door slam outside. I
looked out my window and saw my step-sister going out to greet a
girlfriend of
hers and two older guys I recognized from school, 11<sup>th</sup>
graders I
think. The car must have belonged to one of them. They visited a while
in the
front yard then they all got into the vehicle and left. Oh to be able
to date,
I thought. Katie had said she was going downtown with friends today to
see
something or other. I think it was just an excuse to hang out away from
the
prying eyes of her mother. Katie always seemed to have more freedom
than I ever
did. Maybe it was because she was 15 or maybe it was because my
step-mother
showed her favoritism. I really didn&#8217;t know for sure. Meanwhile I was
stuck in
my room with nothing to do.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
kept watching the clock. It seemed like it
would never move! About 11:00, I heard a car door slam. I didn&#8217;t even
bother
getting up from bed as I figured it was just my sister returning from
her trip.
Still another HOUR to go; damn this was murder. It was the longest time
I ever
had to wait. I didn&#8217;t feel like listening to music so there was nothing
left to
do but sulk and listen to the cars traveling up and down the road.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie,
it&#8217;s time,&#8221; my step-mom called upstairs
in that disgustingly sweet voice of hers. I think she did that just
because she
could tell that it irritated me. She was perceptive that way &#8211; reading
people.
I took comfort in the fact that my new shirt was large and opaque
unlike that
transparent thing Katie had picked out. At least some of my dignity was
still
intact. Katie was going to be disappointed today and that thought
bolstered my
resolve not to let things get to me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Grudgingly
I left me room and slowly walked down
the stairs. Just before rounding the corner of the staircase and
entering the
front room, I heard a girl giggling, &#8220;Is she really going to get
spanked . . .
right in front of us?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">HOLY
CRAP! There were people here!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
heard Katie enthusiastically answer, &#8220;That&#8217;s
right. She is. You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
step-mom spoke up, &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to stay.
Annie needs to learn a lesson.&#8221; Then her tone changed to one more
serious than
before, a bit menacing in fact, &#8220;And YOU ALL might learn something from
this as
well, which is why I don&#8217;t mind if you are here.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;YOU
ALL?!&#8221; How many people were in that room?</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie,
I said it&#8217;s time.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
was no putting this off. My heart was
racing not knowing what to expect. As I took a deep breath and exhaled
slowly
to calm my nerves, I walked around the corner wall separating the
stairs from
the front room.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
gasped quite loudly as sitting there were
Katie, her girlfriend and the two 11<sup>th</sup> grade
boys from school. They
were all smiling from ear to ear looking at me!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Right
over here, Annie,&#8221; my step-mom directed
as she pointed to the center of the room. Our guests were seated all
around the
room and everyone was focused squarely on me!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
legs were trembling as I crept along the
carpet making my way to the appointed spot. My step-mom put her arm
around me
and made me face the wall and the couch where the two boys were
sitting. Katie
and her girlfriend were in the chairs next to the window on the
opposite side
of the room.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Annie
here has done something really stupid
that if done to someone else she&#8217;d be in jail right now &#8211; she stole
money from
me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
two boys&#8217; playful expressions turned
suddenly serious as they continued to listen to my mom. I had to admit
hearing
her make her case really did make me sound like some sort of
delinquent. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;And
just WHY did she do that, you ask? She
STOLE that money to buy THIS!&#8221; My mom suddenly grabbed hold of my shirt
and
pulled it forcefully to the side to make her point, &#8220;A SHIRT which she
just HAD
to have.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
she talked she was pulling my shirt this way
and that while she emphatically used her arms to speak. I clung
desperately to
the bottom of the shirt in an attempt to conceal my Teddy Bear Kiddie
panties
from the boys. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom noticed what I was doing and remarked,
&#8220;Just LOOK at her hanging onto this shirt as if it was her prized
possession.
Well, I&#8217;ve got news for you sister, that shirt is nothing but an
ill-gotten
good and if you think I&#8217;m going to let you keep it you&#8217;ve got another
thing
coming.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To
my absolute horror she produced a pair of
scissors from seemingly out of nowhere and began to cut the material on
the
side of the shirt, starting at the bottom and heading right towards the
top!!
She was going to cut the shirt right off of me!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

room got deathly quiet. The shocked
expressions on the boys told me that not even they knew that my mom was
going
to do such a thing! I looked over my shoulder and Katie and her

looked about the same way, though it wasn&#8217;t long before Katie broke
into a HUGE
smile when she saw me looking at her. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
yanked the material right out of her hand, &#8220;I
DON&#8217;T CARE ABOUT THE SHIRT! You can burn it for all I care, just let me
keep it
on for now!&#8221;</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
comment took my mother aback for a moment.
She had this puzzled look on her face as though she was just now being
made
aware that it wasn&#8217;t the shirt I cared about. I thought that maybe she
realized
what she was doing and was going to spare me that indignity. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
room remained quiet as my mother just looked
at me for a moment or two. I dared not speak in case I said something
to change
her mind. We just looked at each other, each of us studying the face of
the
other. All I could hear was the sound of the large clock on the wall
ticking
away the seconds as she pondered the situation.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
. . . I get it,&#8221; she finally said with an
amused look on her face. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want these boys looking at your
little
boobies.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Her

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well
that&#8217;s too bad. Perhaps that will teach
you a lesson better than just a plain old-fashioned strapping. This
shirt has
got to go. You can choose your sin, little girl, but you can&#8217;t choose
the
consequences.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
AM NOT A LITTLE GIRL!&#8221; I snapped angrily
realizing that she was intent on furthering my humiliation by stripping
me of
my shirt. My step-mom immediately reacted to my disrespectful outburst
by
slapping me across the face. I was stunned. No one had ever slapped me
on the
face. I was so shocked that I just stood there as my step-mother
continued
cutting the material away from my body as the eager eyes of the boys
looked on.
As more and more skin came into their view, the bigger their stupid
grins
became. As she cut away, I pressed the material in front of me against
my chest
in the desperate hope that she would somehow miraculously change her
mind.
Finally enough of the material had been cut for her to suddenly pull
the
garment out from under my hands and away from my body completely. I was
TOPLESS!
I forced my arms tightly against my chest hiding what I didn&#8217;t want
them to
see. </span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom grew impatient and tried to lower my arms
to my sides but I had the advantage. &#8220;Fine, be that way. Boys, come
hold her
arms down for me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
boys started to get up but the last thing I
wanted was to wrestle with them and get &#8220;groped&#8221; in the process so I
relented
and lowered them myself. My mom then motioned for the boys to stay
seated and
kept me standing there for several minutes without saying a word. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
when all my attention was focused on what
the boys were looking at &#8211; my pitiful boobs, I heard Katie&#8217;s girlfriend
laughing from behind me as she exclaimed, &#8220;Aw . . . Look at the cute
Teddy bear
panties!&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
immediately saw both sets of eyes on the boys dart
down to my underwear. It was maybe a nanosecond before they too broke
into
giggling.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
step-mom began her usual lecture on the evils
of crime and how reluctant she was to have to do this, yada, yada, yada
. . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
then began playing with the waistband of the
back my panties with her fingers running them around inside this way
and that
as she continued talking. Every once in a while she&#8217;d pull them pretty
far away
from my butt showing some skin to the girls behind me as I faced the
boys. She
teased me like that for a while pulling and tugging at my panties
sometimes
lowering them in back pretty far before letting them rise up again in
her
grasp, keeping me wondering just when the exact moment would come when
I&#8217;d be
stripped bare. Surely she was going to bend me over a chair or
something before
pulling them down. She had never had me just stand here like this for
so long.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was drowning in my own misery when suddenly I
felt a quick tug and they were off! I immediately used my hands to
cover myself
but it didn&#8217;t matter. My step-mom spun me around to face the girls
letting the
boys see my naked behind. I almost tripped as she spun me around so
fast as the
panties were still around my ankles.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She
looks like a LITTLE girl to me,&#8221; Katie
taunted, making everyone laugh all the more. Even mom laughed at her
comment
before bending me over at the waist giving the boys a free shot into no
man&#8217;s
land. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was in the middle of the room facing the
window about 5 feet away from the couch bent over with my hands on my
knees. My
mom stepped to the side and picked up a strap that belonged to my dad
and began
snapping it in the air. Just the sound of her doing that made me cringe.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
the first sting landed across my bare
flesh. &#8220;One,&#8221; my step mom said softly, but loud enough for the boys to
hear.
The next swing was incredibly hard, the force of which nearly tipped me
over.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;TWO!&#8221;
both boys said excitedly in unison making
the girls chuckle.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
the next swing the entire room shouted out
gleefully, &#8220;THREE!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">By
the time &#8220;TEN&#8221; was shouted tears were rolling
down my eyes. By &#8216;EIGHTEEN,&#8221; I was openly crying some from the pain but
mostly
from the humiliation of it all. Mercifully she stopped at twenty. That
was all
she was going to do. When she stepped away from my butt and put the
belt down I
could swear I heard a couple of voices say, &#8220;Awwwww,&#8221; as if they were
disappointed that my punishment had come to an end.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mom
came over and straightened me up. I wanted
to desperately rub the stinging from my aching flesh but I knew better
than to
do that as she would only start wailing away at me again. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Thirty
minutes . . .&#8221; she announced and I
started for the usual corner but she grabbed hold of my arm and stopped
me and
held me in place. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do your time right here sister facing the
window with
your hands on your head. Katie, you keep track of her time. I don&#8217;t
want her to
move a muscle before 30 minutes are up.&#8221; She pointed towards the floor
with her
finger, &#8220;Step out of them.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
slowly complied with her request as tears were
still streaming down my cheeks. I couldn&#8217;t believe she was making me
step out
of my panties. Having them at my ankles was embarrassing, but somehow
they kept
me from feeling completely naked. Once I had done that, she reached
down,
pickled them up and put them in her pocket.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
looked at me, smiled and said, &#8220;Now boys,
Annie is not permitted to move or to talk during this punishment time .
. . and
don&#8217;t you DARE even THINK of touching her or you&#8217;ll end up just like
she is.&#8221;
She then started heading towards the kitchen but as an afterthought
turned back
towards the room and added, &#8220;But feel free to tease her all you want.&#8221;
She then
left the room chuckling wildly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
I was standing there in the middle of the
room now COMPLETELY bare, hands on the top of my head facing the
window. Then
it dawned on me that the curtains were open and anyone passing by on
the
sidewalk outside could look right in and see me!! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once
my step-mother had left the room everyone
gathered in front of me. One boy took my mother&#8217;s instructions to
heart, &#8220;How
old did you say she was, Katie? NINE?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Everyone
laughed, &#8220;No, she&#8217;s only a couple of months younger than me!&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katie&#8217;s
girlfriend, I still don&#8217;t know her name,
said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, sweetie. Maybe they&#8217;ll grow in a year or two. Let&#8217;s
hope so
anyway because if they haven&#8217;t blossomed by then it looks like you&#8217;ll
be stuck
looking like that.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
was more laughter all around with people making
snide little comments but nothing they said after that was as bad as
the
remarks about my boobs.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
suddenly my step-sister came up to me and
said, &#8220;I heard mom telling the boys that they couldn&#8217;t touch, but she
never
said anything about me.&#8221; Then without warning she reached out and
tweaked the
nipple on my left breast, pinching it hard as she twisted her fingers
around
that it was all I could do to keep from shouting every obscenity in the
book.
Everyone thought that my facial expression was hysterical when she
finally did
let go. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
gang then sat down and continued chatting
about dates and kissing and stuff like that &#8211; just to make me jealous I
supposed. As they continued their indirect teasing of me I stood there
looking
out the window trying not to make eye contact with any of them. It was
then I
spotted several people walking by one the sidewalk. My eyes widened and
I
silently prayed that they would pass by without noticing me through the
window.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Katie
saw the look on my face and quickly jumped
up from her chair. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Annie? What are you looking at?&#8221;
She
then turned around and gazed outside and saw for herself. &#8220;Hey guys,
check it
out. There are people out there!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
didn&#8217;t take long before everyone was looking
outside and the teasing started again. &#8220;Maybe we should do the
neighborly thing
and invite them in for refreshments or something.&#8221; One boy said. The
other boy
quickly added, &#8220;Yeah, after all, it is hot out there.&#8221; My legs began to
shake
as I couldn&#8217;t tell if they were serious or not. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
didn&#8217;t matter. As they were all teasing and
talking about what they would like to do there was a knock on the
door!!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Everyone
suddenly stopped talking and looked at
me a bit perplexed. I wasn&#8217;t sure but I think they really didn&#8217;t know
what to
do at that point. Kidding was one thing but this was something else
altogether.
</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
gang just looked at each other and back at
me. Whoever it was at the door now rang the doorbell.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">One
of the boys whispered to Katie, &#8220;What do we
do?&#8221; She just shrugged her shoulders.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WOULD
SOMEBODY GET THE DOOR, PLEASE,&#8221; My
step-mom shouted from the kitchen. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">One
of the boys whispered again, &#8220;Is she
serious?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
guess so,&#8221; Katie whispered back. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But
what about her?&#8221; he asked pointing at me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well
. . . her time isn&#8217;t anywhere near up yet
and my mom knows that so . . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We
answer the door!&#8221; Katie&#8217;s girlfriend
exclaimed excitedly obviously thrilled at the prospect of exposing me
to yet
more people.</span>
