<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Thomas Morrison (22) –

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-weight: bold;">Part 5</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">

</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate and her roomies were somewhat apprehensive during
the evening meal, wondering what was in store for them at the dorm meeting. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like that we were told to be in pajamas,&rdquo; Kara mused. &ldquo;That probably
means a spanking for some of us. Did anybody get spanked in class today?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate raised her hand and blushed. &ldquo;I got spanked in
English class for being late. And Connie Armstrong from the West wing got
spanked for laughing at me.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Laura also raised her hand. &ldquo;I got spanked in Algebra
for passing notes. The girl I passed the notes to got spanked, too. Her name is
Beth and she lives on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. It seems like EVERYTHING is a
spanking offense here.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Rachel giggled. "I think they can spank us for
anything they feel like spanking us for. Hell, they'll probably give us a
spanking along with our diplomas when we graduate."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate sighed. "And I was going to be SUCH a good
girl in college. The way things are going, we might just as well leave our
skirts and panties in the dorm and start out every day bare-bottomed."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kara nodded: "Yep and most of the girls in the
dorm haven't been spanked even once since school started. I think the whole
faculty has focused on us."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate shook her head. "Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen it before, a
few kids get marked as "naughty" early on and they get watched more
closely and spanked at the drop of a hat."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Rachele giggled again. "Well if you drop your
hat, I am NOT gonna bend over to pick it up. Not around this batch of
spanking-crazy sadists."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate looked at her watch. "Well, its 7:05, guess
we better go face our doom."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The four girls changed into their pajamas and joined
the rest of the girls from the East wing in the lounge on the North side. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Already in the lounge were Gail and Warren Weathers
and two young men dressed in cadet uniforms. This was the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; uniform with
short-sleeved khaki shirts and olive-green trousers. The girls sighed at the
handsome pair, wishing that they were dressed ion something more mature-looking
than child&rsquo;s pajamas. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When everybody was seated, Gail introduced the pair. &ldquo;This
is our first group meeting for Wing 2E. These are the two Student Monitors for
Wing 2E; Tom Morrison and Chuck Carter. I&rsquo;ll let them introduce themselves and
explain their duties.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&ldquo;Hello, girls,&rdquo; The taller of the two cadets smiled. &ldquo;My
name is Tom Morrison and I am the Senior SM for the east wing. I am a senior at
Bridger Academy, majoring in Economics. I will be taking three upper-level
classes here at McClintok this term, so you may see me around campus. This is
my second semester here. Last fall I was the Junior SM on Wing 4E. Chuck?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The other cadet stood up. &ldquo;My name is Charles Carter,
but I usually go by &lsquo;Chuck.&rsquo; I am a junior at Bridger, majoring in Psychology. Like
Tom, I am taking three upper-level classes here. This is my first semester
here, so be patient with me. Back to you, Tom.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Tom stepped forward again. &ldquo;Let me explain the general
rules of the dorm and our roles. SM&rsquo;s supervise up to 24 girls on a corridor. We
report to the RA&rsquo;s, Dr. and Dr. Weathers. Normally, we will be your primary
contact with the school&rsquo;s administrative and disciplinary systems. We are
authorized to carry out corporal punishment as we see fit. Usually this
consists of a bare-bottom spanking. You will have noticed that there are no
locks on any of the doors of the Wing. This is to give us immediate access in
emergencies or to conduct unannounced inspections. As long as you are not being
naughty, you have nothing to fear from us.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Kate winced at the word &ldquo;naughty.&rdquo; It seems that word
covered a lot of things here.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; Tom continued, &ldquo;We are not going to be
sneaking around peeking at you for the fun of it. We see lots of bare girl-skin
and it&rsquo;s no big thrill for us. You are like little sisters to us. We are here
to help you, guide you, protect you and occasionally correct your behavior. By
the way, the &lsquo;protect&rsquo; part is not an exaggeration. All SM&rsquo;s are trained in
hand-to-hand combat as well as conflict resolution. Since boys are not allowed
above the first floor, I would not advise trying to sneak one into your room. The
consequences for both of you could be quite unpleasant.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Kate shuddered. If being late for class got a girl
spanked, imagine what the punishment would be for getting caught with a boy in
her room.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&ldquo;My room number is 2N2, Chuck is in 2N3. The other two
SM&rsquo;s for the floor, Don Hudson and Fred Rosenberg and in 2N4 and 2N5. The RA&rsquo;s
apartment is 2N6. There will be an &ldquo;open&rdquo; sign on each door when a RA or SM is
available for counseling, Otherwise, try to catch us in the hallways or in
classes. We do want to help you whenever we can, especially in the first month
or so when all of this is new to you. Now I&rsquo;ll turn the meeting back over to
Dr. Weathers.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The two cadets sat down, and Gail Weathers resumed her
place at the front of the lounge. &ldquo;As Tom explained, we ae really all here to
help you. You may not appreciate the &ldquo;tough love&rdquo; you have received and will
continue to receive, but it will benefit you in the end.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Titters from the girls)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gail smiled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way but, yes, your
ends will experience the &lsquo;benefit&rsquo; of your training. Now if there are no
general questions, you can go back to your rooms. Tom and Chuck will remain at
the back of the lounge to answer specific or personal questions. I understand
that three of you were spanked in class today. Hands?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate and Laura raised their hands reluctantly as did
Brandy Sloan, a very young-looking girl from 2E9.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&ldquo;Ok, you girls come up here and the rest are dismissed.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Warren Weathers sat down in his chair and beckoned to
Kate. "When a girl gets spanked in class, we always check her out to make
sure no real damage was done. I understand you and Connie got two spankings
today?&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate nodded, feeling a flush of shame. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&ldquo;Well, I will check Connie out after this meeting.
Meanwhile, drop your jammie bottoms and bend over my lap.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate walked over and the RA settled her over his lap,
She flinched slightly as his hand stroked her bare bottom gently.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Hmmm, looks like a thoroughly spanked bottom,
but no serious bruising or bleeding. Still, it probably hurts quite a bit,
doesn't it?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate sniffled, embarrassed at the exposure, "Yes
sir, it does."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Weathers patted her bottom gently. "Gail, could
you bring me the aloe cream?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Taking the jar of skin cream from his wife, Weathers
carefully smeared a generous portion on Kate's bottom and began rubbing it in. It
was a bit painful at first, but the soothing cream diminished the pain somewhat
and Kate began to find the experience almost pleasant. Of course, the fact that
six other people were closely watching her bare bottom, diminished the feelings
of pleasure somewhat. But after a few minutes of rubbing, her bottom felt much
better and she actually smiled a bit in relief.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When he was satisfied with the condition of her
bottom, Weathers pulled up her PJ pants, lifted her to a sitting position on
his lap and gave her a hug. "OK. little one, you can get up now and let Laura
have a turn."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate scrambled to her feet and stood behind his chair
as Laura lowered herself into position. The RA lowered her PJ&rsquo;s and repeated
the same procedure he had used on Kate. Laura sniffled a bit as Kate had, but
accepted the attention with some gratitude as the pain in her thoroughly
spanked bottom subsided. The same procedure was followed with the very
childish-looking Brandy. Meanwhile, Gail brought out a low coffee table and three
large pillows which she placed on the floor near Warren's chair. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"I'll bet you girls would like some cake and ice
cream," she said cheerfully.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Yes, Ma'am," the three girls responded with
some surprise.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Go ahead and set yourselves down on the
pillows," the young woman invited. "I don't think you want to sit on hard
lounge chairs right now.&rdquo;'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">As the bewildered girls - who had been expecting a
much less friendly encounter - sat themselves down, Gail went into the kitchen
and returned with large slices of chocolate cake, scoops of vanilla ice cream
and three big glasses of milk. "Dig in, girls," she remarked,
"We have already had our desserts."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">As the girls gratefully, but carefully, began to eat
their unexpected treats, Gail addressed the SM&rsquo;s.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"We wanted you to be here to see the results of
some of our stricter teachers in action. Chuck, you are new at the SM job and
need to be aware of what can happen. It is quite rare for a girl to be spanked
twice in one day, but it does happen. Your job as SM's is twofold. One is to
discipline the girls in your trust and the other is to protect them from
overzealous discipline by the teachers. Now we support and, indeed, encourage
our teachers to use corporal punishment, including bare-bottom spanking, to
enforce order and discipline in the classrooms. But, like any other form of
discipline, it can be overdone, and the children can be hurt."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Back to &ldquo;children&rdquo; again, dammit. But my bottom feels
better, and this is very good cake.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Now the bottoms you saw tonight were not really
abused. They were spanked very thoroughly, but there was no bleeding or skin
damage and only a few bruises. When the girls leave here tonight, we will give
them notes to ensure that they are not spanked in class tomorrow. They need a
bit of time to heal and rest. A sore bottom is a good thing for a teenage girl.
but not if it's too sore for her to pay attention in class. We need to educate
her brain as well as her bottom"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The three girls brightened at the prospect of a day
with a "no-spanking" card. But their optimism was somewhat diminished
by what followed. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"But this does not mean that these little scamps
will get away with anything." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"If one of them misbehaves tomorrow, her spanking
will be postponed until her bottom is recovered enough to accept it. The
teacher will fill out a note and send it to us and we will determine when the
spanking should be scheduled. This will normally be two or three days later in
the same class as her original misbehavior occurred. Or, with the teacher's
consent, we will do the spanking at a dorm meeting during the next few days. There
is no free ride for naughty little girls."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The "naughty little girls" blushed again. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Kate) Waiting 2-3 days for a spanking would majorly
suck}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Laura) A dorm meeting? How humiliating!)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Brandy) I&rsquo;m gonna be the goodest little girl on campus
– at least until my butt heals.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gail produced three green ribbons with laminated green
cards attached to them. "These are the 'No Spanking' cards the girls will
wear on days when they are not to be spanked. This will alert teachers not to
be too quick to spank them and avoid unfortunate incidents."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">{(Kate) Wonderful. Now every teacher and kid on campus
will know that I have just had a hard spanking}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">{Laura) A green card? Why not a scarlet letter? Just
shoot me now before I die of shame}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Brandy) If somebody teases me about the card, I&rsquo;ll
pull her fucking hair out. No, wait, that would just get me another spanking.
Curses.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gail ordered the girls to stand up and proceeded to
hang a green ribbon around each girl's neck. The bright green ribbon and card stood
out clearly against the white blouses. She showed them that one side of the
card had SPANK PASS in big letters and the other side had the girl's name
laminated into it with an erasable area for the date of spanking immunity. The
girls said nothing, but their long faces clearly showed that this was not the
kind of distinguishing "decoration" they wanted to wear.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">{Kate) Every other kid is gonna want to read this and
then tease me about it}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">{Laura) - I wonder if it's too late to join the Army?}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Brandy) – Please let me not start bawling now)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gail smiled. "Well this should keep your bottoms
protected for one day anyway. Now we need to clean you up a little bit. Come
here, child," beckoning to Laura."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">As a confused Laura stepped forward, Gail grasped her
chin and used a dampened napkin to wipe off traces of frosting, ice cream and
milk off Connie's mouth, chin and cheeks. Then she repeated her actions with
Kate and Brandy. "Now our little girls are nice and clean."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Warren smiled as well. "OK, kids, give Uncle
Warren big hug and run along to bed. Tomorrow will be a busy day. Gail will be
down later to tuck you in." He hugged each girl, ruffled her hair and sent
them out the door with a friendly pat on the bottom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Outside the door, Kate looked at Laura and started to
cry. "Could ANYTHING have been more humiliating that THAT? They did
everything to treat us like six-year-olds except give us lollipops."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Laura was crying too. "Lollipops? I was half-expecting
a pacifier. I came here two weeks ago as a nineteen-year old woman and now I
feel like a slightly backwards six-year old. I almost peed my pants when she
wiped the frosting off my cheek with that napkin."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate smiled through her tears. "Oh, God, she
would have taken all your clothes off and put you in a diaper if you'd done
that. And probably sent you back to your room that way."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Yeah, " Laura replied. "And now she's
gonna come down and 'tuck us in'. Probably with more baby talk so all the other
girls can laugh at us after she leaves."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Brandy said nothing. She was crying and hiccupping.
She straggled off in the general direction of her room, leaving Kate and Laura
alone at the door to the lounge.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Well whatever you do, don't ask her for a glass
of water when she comes down, " Kate giggled. "She'll probably insist
on escorting you to the potty."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Laura sighed. "Well, we sure as shit better
behave for a while or we will be that laughingstock of the campus. It happened
in my junior high school. Two boys got a reputation for being in trouble and
every teacher was watching them every second. They got paddled for stuff they
never really did, just because the teachers blamed them when anything went wrong,
and they couldn't prove who did it."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Wow," Kate said apprehensively. "That
could be us. We fucking well better watch our asses if we want any skin left on
them by the end of the semester."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The sound of a clearing throat behind them froze them
in terror. It was Chuck, the SM. "Girls, i am disappointed in you. Five
minutes out of the meeting and you are using foul language in a public place. Let
me see your cards."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">As the young man notes their names in his pocket
notebook, the two girls knew the depths of despair. Handing back their cards, Chuck
nodded and walked off.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Neither girl could move for a few seconds. "Deer
in the headlights" was an understatement.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"Oh, my God," Laura finally choked out.
"We are majorly dead meat for the term."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kate could say nothing, she was crying too hard.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>

<br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span>
