<span style="">&nbsp;</span><br>
Kate Brady &#8211; a very immature 18-year-old from Long Island, New York. 5-1" with
strawberry blonde hair, a small waist and ample bottom. Tends toward procrastination,
smartass remarks and minor mischief.<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"> </span><br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span><br>
Rachel Miller - (18) Kate&#8217;s roommate, from Marion, Ohio. Brownish hair, 5-3",
good figure. Quieter by nature, but tends to be suggestible, often follows Kate
into trouble.<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"> </span><br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span><br>
Kara Floyd - (20) from Tampa, Florida. Lives across the hall from Kate, Kara has
long blonde hair, stands 5-7" and is quite slim with a baby face that makes
her look much younger. Somewhat bossy toward the younger girls.<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"> </span><br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span><br>
Laura Campbell - (19) from Liberty, Kansas. Kara's roommate, 5-5", slightly
chubby, dark brown hair. Quiet and studious, follows the other girls into trouble
reluctantly, but is quite loyal.<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"> </span><br>

Gail Weathers - (28) Assistant Professor of English, 5-8, athletic, blonde 5-9."
Counselor for Kate's dorm with responsibility for 48 freshman girls. (NOTE: Junior
faculty members at McClintok are not well paid, so often take additional jobs as
counselors for the free apartment and dining room privileges. Most consider it a
fringe benefit to be able to spank naughty young girls.)<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"> </span><br>

Looks older than his age and is considered a favorite "uncle" by many
of the girls. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Part
2</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lunch was a bit stressful, with all four
girls squirming on their hard plastic chairs, but the other kids in the dining room
seemed to be amused. The Weathers sat at the faculty table nearby and smiled over
at the red-faced foursome from time to time. Kara whispered to Kate, "Sit still,
everybody's looking at us."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sit still yourself, " Kate
whispered back. "You're trying to eat with your bottom half in inch off the
chair and you're bobbing up and down like a jack-in-the-box."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I hope we have soft chairs for
the dorm meeting,&#8221; Rachel moaned. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The dorm meeting was held in the main
lounge, but by time they got there, the couches were full and only hard chairs were
left. Kate sighed and opted for lying on the hardwood floor face down and her head
propped up on her elbows. The other three girls joined her.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Sandy Keith, from the other corridor,
sat down and reached over and pulled up Kara's skirt, revealing the red areas below
her panties. "OOH! Somebody got a good spanking. Looks like we have four naughty
little girls here, " she giggled.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kara reached back and grabbed Sandy's
braid and yanked hard. "Let go of that, you little bitch,", Sandy squealed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Don't call me that, you twit,"
Kara snarled and smacked the other girl on the side of the head. In a few seconds
the two girls were rolling around the floor, scratching, biting and trying to grab
something vulnerable. The other girls scrambled out of the way and stood around
in a circle, some calling for them to stop and others encouraging one party or the
other.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">At that moment Gail Weathers walked into
the room, accompanied by two older women. "What in the world is going on here?"
she demanded. "Is this a college or a pre-school?" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The two fighters paused and the other
girls managed to separate them. "Get your sorry butts up to the front of the
room RIGHT NOW,&#8221; the dorm counselor snapped. "I will not have fighting in my
dormitory."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The two girls stood sheepishly in front
of their angry counselor. "Sandy started it," Kara mumbled. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Did not,&#8221; Sandy snapped.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Did too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Did not."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail sighed. "All right, that's
enough. Does somebody else want to tell me what happened?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Laura stepped forward. "Sandy pulled
up Kara's skirt and teased her about being spanked." she said. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, and then what happened."
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Laura hesitated. "Umm, Kara kinda
grabbed one of Sandy's braids and then Sandy went bonkers.'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail looked suspicious, "You're
Laura, Kara's roomie, aren't you?" When the girl nodded, Gail looked around.
"Can I get some information from a neutral party?'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">One of the other girls spoke up. "That's
about what happened. They started calling each other names, but I think Kara did
the first actual hitting."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"First day on the job and I get
a smart-ass in the fitting room and a girl-fight at the first dorm meeting."
Gail groaned. "OK girls, panties down and bend over."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The two girls glared resentfully at each
other and complied. Gail lifted each skirt and tucked the hems into the girls' waistbands.
"Fortunately, I planned ahead and brought along this nice, heavy wooden ruler."
she said menacingly. Kara whimpered and Sandy moaned.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail tapped the 24-inch ruler a few times
on Kara's red bottom and Sandy's pale one. Both girls shivered in anticipation.
Then she brought down the ruler full force on the center of Sandy's bottom. The
SMACK was so loud that both girls yelped and some of the other girls jumped or winced.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail proceeded to give a dozen hard smacks
to each of the two bare bottoms in front of her. Both girls were soon howling, blubbering
and squirming their bottoms around in a most lively manner.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail paused and let the two sobbing girls
recover somewhat. "OK, Kara, you march over to the corner there and put your
hands on your head. Leave your panties down and don't move, talk or rub for the
rest of the meeting.' Kara complied, shuffling to the corner with her parties around
her ankle.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Now, then Sandy, since you were
the one who started this, you are getting an extra half-dozen. maybe that will be
a lesson to all of you not to tease a girl who has gotten a spanking."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Please, ma' am, don't spank me
any more," the thoroughly chastened teen wailed. "I've learned my lesson,
I'll be good, I promise, really I do, Please, please, please, it HURTS so much."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Nonsense, child, " the counselor
snorted. "I have given children no bigger than you three dozen with the ruler
and they survived. Now bend back over."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The six spanks were laid on with full
vigor and Sandy screamed in agony with each one. Finally, it was over and the sobbing
teen was sent to join Kara in the corner.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Well, now that we have dealt with
our little juvenile delinquents, we can get on with the meeting." Gail stated.
"But first, I have an award to present. Kate Brady, step forward."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kate looked confused but stepped forward.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I would like to introduce Doctor
Alice Hastings, our Dean of Students," indicating the older of the two women,
&#8220;And Doctor Marcia Devereaux, head of the school Medical Clinic. Dr Devereaux will
be passing on some health and nutrition information and Dr Hastings will have some
information on campus rules and penalties for rules infractions."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">There were some groans and raised eyebrows
at that announcement, but Gail continued. "Don't worry, it's not going to be
"Smut 101" like you all had in high school and it won't be just a list
of impossible rules and draconian penalties. But we do believe in discipline here,
as you have just witnessed."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Speaking of which, Dr Hastings
has an award for little Kate here."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The Dean stepped forward and produced
a small jewel box. "Now most of you can't see this, but it is a pin in the
shape of a small gold-plated paddle. It is called the BOTM Award. which is short
for "Brat of The Month" award, fondly known as the "Bratty."
It is kind of the reverse of the Good Conduct Medals they give out in the Army.
This goes to the girl who has been the naughtiest each month. It is also traditionally
given to the first girl to receive a bare-bottom spanking every term. So, this goes
to Kate Brady - although she only beat out her colleagues here by a few hours. Step
forward Kate."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kate brushed bright red, but stepped
forward gallantly and allowed the Dean to pin the award on the collar of her blouse.
"Now when you get issued your blazers, this pin will be pinned on the left
lapel. It is part of your uniform and will be verified at inspections. Should you
be unlucky enough to be awarded additional "Bratties&#8221; the plain pin will be
replaced with one listing the total number awarded."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The Dean continued. &#8220;In case you are
wondering, the record for number of Bratties received in a four year stay at McClintok
is seventeen. I hope nobody here plans to break that record. And, interestingly
enough, the girl who set that record, over 20 years ago, is now an appeals Court
judge in Ohio. I like to think we made some kind of impression on her."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The Dean hugged Kate and said, &#8220;You may
sit down now, child, if you can." <span style="">&nbsp;</span>the
embarrassed Kate went back to her spot on the floor and resumed her bottom-up position.
The other girls straggled back to their previous positions.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"And now we will let Dr, Devereaux
tell you some of the things that you should know about health and safety issues
on campus. After that, I will say a few words about student conduct, although I
think you know what to expect."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kate and her three suite-mates managed
to get through the rest of the orientation lectures and dinner without committing
any spankable offenses. They decided to take in a movie at the Student Union building
and did not get back to the dorm until after 10 PM, which put them well ahead of
the 11 PM curfew for school nights. Passing the first-floor lounge, their curiosity
was aroused by the signs sounds of wood impacting flesh and the yelps and cries
coming from the lounge. The door was unlocked so they peeked in and saw a young
girl wearing only pajama tops draped over the lap of Warren Weathers. Six other
girls in various states of dress were seated on the couches surrounding the big
armless chair that was the feature of every lounge in the dorm. Gail Weathers, standing
beside the door, motioned the four girls to come in and sit down.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Who's getting spanked,&#8221; Laura asked
in hushed tones.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"The girl getting spanked right
now is Corrine Larrabee from the third floor." the Counselor whispered back.
The black girl in the corner is Linda Kramer, her roommate." For the first
time Kate saw the dark-skinned girl standing in the far corner - leaning actually,
she seemed barely able to stand - and was weeping profusely as her hands frantically
tried to rub the sting out of her seared bottom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"What did they do?" Kara asked
fearfully.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"They were caught downtown using
forged ID to buy booze,&#8221; Gail explained. "The town police brought them up here
and turned them over to us. Lucky for them, actually, they could have gone to jail
and had to explain to their parents."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kate doubted the "lucky" part.
Warren was using a heavy hairbrush and laying on the spanks with full strength.
The tormented teen was screaming at the top of her lungs and bucking up and down
with the vigor of a rodeo bull as the big brush thundered into her quivering bare
bottom. When her bottom was bright red all over and she was sobbing incoherently,
Warren stopped spanking and helped the girl to her feet.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"All right, Corrine." he stated
calmly. "Now stand with your hands on the chair seat and your feet together.
Linda, come over and stand on the opposite side of the chair in a similar pose."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The black girl complied and soon the
two roommates were standing on opposite sides of the chair, presenting their bare
bottoms at the appropriate angle. Gail reached into their equipment bag and produced
two long, thin sections of flexible composite material - actually the ends of fiberglass
fly rods with the ferrules and wrappings removed. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Now you will be feeling the sting
in your bottoms for a few days," Warren stated. "But that will probably
not be observed you your fellow students. What they WILL observe, however is the
stripes that these rods will be putting onto your thighs. That will remind them
of the penalties for forging ID's."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Warren tapped the fiberglass rod against
Corrine's thighs a few times as the terrified teen cringed. Then he brought it down
with a swift CRACK at the juncture of her bottom and thighs. This produced a loud
yelp and while line which almost immediately turned red and swelled into a welt
across both thighs. Gail repeated the stroke on Linda and was rewarded by the same
loud howl and a comparable welt. This was repeated five times on each girl and produced
six red welts which would obviously take many days to fade away completely.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The two girls managed to remain in position
during this final ordeal but the tears were flowing down their cheeks in a steady
stream and their breath came in wrenching sobs. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail handed her rod to Warren and addressed
the two punished girls and the others in the lounge. "This concludes the first
phase of your punishment. You will be confined to the dormitory during non-class
hours for one week, beginning tomorrow. You will be escorted to and from classes
and appointments by one of the Student Monitors. Should you misbehave in any way
wile under escort, the escort will have the full authority to take down your panties
and paddle your bottoms wherever you may be and whoever else may be present. Do
you understand this?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Ma'am,&#8221; both girls replied
in shaky voices. Gail looked around at the rest of the girls. "For those of
you who have not yet read all of with your Student Manuals, Student Monitors are
upper level male cadets at Bridger Military Academy with which we have association
agreements. SM's are specially trained to deal with naughty little girls."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kate winced at the &#8220;naughty little girls"
reference and visualized herself being spanked on the bare bottom by one of the
smartly uniformed cadets. Somehow, that was scary and erotic at the same time.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Gail turned back to the two punished
girls. "Now Corrine and Linda, you will report to this room promptly at 7:30
each evening for a bare-bottomed slippering to be delivered by Dr Weathers or myself
or by a Student Monitor we have designated for the task. Finally, you will each
prepare a fully researched article of between 1500 and 2000 words on the dangers
of alcohol to the physical, mental and emotional development of adolescents. That
paper will be delivered to me at the time of your final slippering, eight days from
now. Do you have any questions?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"No, ma'am,&#8221; &#8220;N-no, Dr Weathers,&#8217;
came from the two punished girls.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Fair enough," the counselor
stated. "All of you are dismissed, go straight to your rooms and get ready
for bed. Tomorrow will be another busy day.'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-US">End of Part 2</span>
