McClintock College, called Fawn Hall, is a four-story building. The first floor
houses the cafeteria, lounges, a small gym, training rooms, laundry rooms and
other accessory facilities. The upper three floors are basically identical
dormitory sections. Each floor has three wings. The North wing holds an
apartment for the Faculty Residents &#8211; married couples who are in charge of
their respective floors, smaller rooms for Student Mentors and a lounge for
residents. The East and West wings each hold six suites, each containing a
small common room, a bathroom and two bedrooms, each bedroom occupied by two
girls. Kate and Rachel live in room E11A, Kara and Laura live in in E11B. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Part 3</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The four girls from suite E11 wandered into
their suite looking a bit overwhelmed. Laura was quick to remind them of the
&#8220;Pajama rule.&#8221; While there were no formal bedtimes, all girls in the dormitory
after 8 PM were required to be in their pajamas, with no underclothing. This
rule was enforced by the SM&#8217;s who had full access to all areas of the
buildings. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As the four girls scrambled into their PJ&#8217;s,
Rachel whined, &#8220;You know they are treating us like grade-school kids, not like
the young adults that we are supposed to be.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kara laughed out loud. &#8220;Rachel, you know damn
well that we ARE little kids in ways that matter. None of us is remotely close
to being adults. I&#8217;m twenty years old, twenty-one in two months. I should be in
my third year of college now. But I had to repeat the eighth grade because of &#8216;behaviour
problems&#8217; and I got kicked out of two colleges for the same reason. I KNOW that
I&#8217;m an immature brat and so are all the girls in this dorm. That&#8217;s why we are
all here instead of a grown-up college.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Laura nodded. &#8220;She&#8217;s right. You notice that none
of the faculty called us &#8216;women&#8217; or even &#8216;young women&#8217; like they do in REAL
colleges. They call us &#8216;girls&#8217;, &#8216;kids&#8217;, &#8216;children&#8217; and worse. We&#8217;re all
somewhere between age 10 and 13 mentally and emotionally.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Kate grumbled. &#8220;Did you notice that
there are no locks on any of the doors? Not the door to the suite, our bedrooms
doors or even the bathroom doors. Anybody can walk in on us any time. Other
girls, the faculty or even the SM&#8217;s. How would you like sitting on the can and
having some guy our age walk in on you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Laura shuddered. &#8220;Gross. But the only guys
allowed above the first floor are the SM&#8217;s and they are used to seeing little
girls&#8217; bare bottoms all the time.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kara chortled. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re doing it too. You
just called us &#8216;little girls&#8217; just like they do.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Rachel sighed. &#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t solve anything
tonight. We really better go to bed like good little girls. Tomorrow is going
to be another long day. Let&#8217;s hope we can get through it without another
spanking.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Anybody want to bet on that?&#8221; Kate asked. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">There were no takers, so the four wandered off
to bed, all sleeping on their tummies for obvious reasons.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The girls got up on time the next morning and
made it through breakfast without incident. Kate's first class was English 101
which started at 8:00 AM. Somehow, she lingered a bit too long on the building
steps gossiping with Kara, whose first class was not until 9:00 AM.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As the bell rang in the classroom building, Kate
realized that she was late for her very first class. She also realized that she
had forgotten the room number and had to look at each door before she found the
one that said, "English 101 - Mr. Talbot." By the time she had
recovered her breath and a small degree of self-possession, it was 8:06. She
entered the room as quietly as she could, hoping to sneak into a seat without
being noticed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">No such luck. the door was right next to then
teacher's desk and Mr. Talbot, a short, middle aged man with a pencil moustache
and a tired look was standing right next to her. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Ah, another young lady has decided to
grace us with her presence, " he sneered. "And, my dear child, are
you one of my students or just some lost waif wandering the hallways of life in
search of fulfillment?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I - I -I am a student, Sir," the
flustered teen replied. "Kate Brady, Sir."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot checked the printout on his clipboard and
made a note. "So you are, young lady, so you are. I would have judged you
to be a few years too young for college, but, be that as it may, you are in the
right place. You are not on time, however, and for that you will be punished. Please
face the chalkboard and bend over my desk."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate blushed furiously noting that there were over
twenty students in the class including two boys in civilian clothing and one in
uniform. She bent over the desk and grasped the far edge.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot lifted up her short skirt and tucked the
hem into the waistband, thus affording the whole class a prime view of Kate's
bikini panties and much of her bottom as well.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I see that you are wearing a paddle pin,
my child," Talbot remarked. "Was that just awarded to you this
week?" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"-Y-Y-Yes, Sir,&#8221; Kate admitted. "Yesterday,
Sir."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I see," the professor remarked
thoughtfully. "Now, you are aware that different instructors have
different procedures for discipline, within some general guidelines, are you
not?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir,&#8221; Kate answered. This was getting
worse and worse. Not only was she going to be spanked, she was going through a
"Twenty Questions" session with her bottom almost bare and exposed to
the whole class, including three boys. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"One of the options involves whether or not
the offender's bottom is bared. I usually spank on the panties for the first
offense, but in the case of girls wearing paddle pins, I lower their panties
even for the first offense."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Putting his words into action, Talbot lowered
Kate's panties to a point just below her bottom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"You also understand that I may, in the
future, lower your panties to your knees or even to your ankles, do you
not?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">'Yes, Mr. Talbot," the mortified girl
responded. More question-and-answer and now the class was looking at her fully
bare bottom. Somebody giggled and Kate almost lost it, making an involuntary
squirming motion that brought forth several more giggles.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot looked annoyed. "This is not an
occasion for entertainment. If there are any further outbursts of that nature,
the young lady responsible will find herself next to Miss Brady and will fully
share her punishment plus five extra strokes."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot made a close inspection of Kate's bottom,
running his fingers over the barely visible marks of her previous spankings. "Your
bottom seems to have recovered quite quickly form your previous punishment, Miss
James. Do you normally heal this rapidly?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I-I-I- guess so, Sir" Kate responded
cautiously. "I haven't been spanked much in the past few years." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{DAMN - that was dumb, opening it up for more
conversation!}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Ah, it appears that a significant part of
your education has been neglected,&#8221; Talbot mused. "Well I am sure we will
make up for that here. Discipline is important for a young girl's journey into
adulthood, is it not?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir." Kate responded</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{Short answers, don't give him an opening for
more conversation.}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Just so." the professor mused.
"Now it comes to deciding the number of strokes to be delivered and the
instrument for delivery. of those strokes. Now Miss Brady, what is the standard
penalty for being late to class?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate was dumbfounded. She should have read the
damned penalty lists more carefully!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">U-u-uh, ten strokes plus one per minute,"
she guessed. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Not quite. Does anybody know the correct
answer?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">(DAMN again!! Now we have the class answering
questions and I'm still showing my bare bottom to everybody in the room and I
am starting to sweat where my bare tummy is pressing on the desktop.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, the young lady in the second row Miss,
uh Davenport?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Twenty stokes, Sir?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Also, incorrect. The proper answer is five
strokes plus one for each minute late. Since Miss James was six minutes late,
she would normally receive five for being late and six for the six minutes of
tardiness for a total of eleven. But since she asked for ten plus the six, we
will give her the full sixteen. Do you understand that, Miss Brady?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Very good, now that we have established
the number of strokes to be administered, we must decide upon the means of
delivery. What are the allowable devices to be used on tardy students, Miss Brady?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate racked her brain. {fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck -
I'm gonna be standing here with my bare ass in the air all morning.} "Uh,
Paddle, ruler and strap, Sir?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot shook his head in mock dismay. "My
dear child, you don't seem to have studied very well. The strap is not to be
used for tardiness and you forgot about the hand. That's two errors, so we will
add two strokes to your spanking for a total of eighteen."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"You know that most instructors give a
simple hand spanking for most trivial offenses. I might simply have put you
over my knee, raised your skirt and spanked you eleven times on your panties.
Do you know why I have elaborated so much on the procedure, Miss James?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{Because you're a dirty old man who likes to
look at little girls' bottoms and show off your power to scare the other kids}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Aloud, she said, &#8220;No, Sir"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"This little demonstration is to impress
upon you and the other students the importance of following school rules and
even more so, the importance of KNOWING the school rules. Do you think you have
learned something this morning, Miss Brady?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir," Kate responded. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{I've learned that you are a sadistic bastard
who should be castrated and shot}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">At that point, Kate's uncomfortable position
betrayed her and a sharp spasm convulsed her lower body so that her bottom
gyrated wildly for a few seconds. There were a few giggles and one loud titter
from the class and her face blushed bright red.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Mr. Talbot had been watching out of the corner
of his eye and spotted the girl who had tittered. "Miss Armstrong, will
you step forward please."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Connie Armstrong whom Kate had met briefly the
previous day, gave out a gasp of despair and walked slowly to the front of the
room. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot smiled at the prospect of another victim,
"Well, Miss Armstrong, do you remember what I said a few minutes ago about
outbursts from the class?'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir," Connie replied
tremulously.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"And what was that?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Th-th-that any girl who laughed at Kate
would share her punishment plus five strokes, Sir." Connie tried to cover
all the bases.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Very good, Miss Armstrong." At least
you have learned to listen to instructions, but you don't seem to have made
much progress in obeying them, have you?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Umm, No, Sir." Connie answered. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{Oh, God, I am still showing off my bare ass to
the world and now THEY are playing twenty questions. Why can't he just spank me
and deal with her afterwards?}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Well Miss Armstrong, it is time for you to
assume your proper position next to Miss Brady on the desk," the professor
stated.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Connie reluctantly bent over the desk and
whimpered a bit as Talbot secured her skirt and lowered her panties to expose
her full bare bottom. Talbot carefully examined the fresh bottom. "It
would appear, Miss Armstrong, that you have not been spanked during your brief
tenure at McClintok. Is that true."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"That is correct, Sir," Connie said.
"I have not been spanked while I have been here."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot spent a few moments rearranging the two
bottoms so that they were touching each other. Kate could feel the warmth of
Connie's bottom cheeks and was sure the other girl was blushing as strongly as
she was.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"You girls may hold hands, if you
wish," Talbot offered. "It may help you stay in position."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate reached out toward Connie and her right
hand grasped Connie's left hand. Both girls squeezed gently, and it did feel a
little reassuring.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot surveyed the situation and readjusted the
two bottoms one last time. "Since we have a rather larger target here with
two bottoms instead of one, I believe the instrument of choice will be the
ruler. This is my personal favorite, a heavy wooden 24-inch model that has
brought tears to the eyes of many naughty little girls over the years." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Now for the ground rules: I will alternate
spanking between the two bottoms. Miss Brady will receive eighteen spanks and
Miss Armstrong will receive twenty-three. Both of you will remain in place
until both have received their full quota. If you raise your body up off the
desk or lift your feet off the floor, the stroke will not count. If you let go
of the other girl's hand, both of you will receive an extra stroke. If you use
a curse word or foul language, you will receive an extra stroke per word. Do
you understand these rules?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Y-yes, Sir,' from both girls.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Good, now rise up onto your tiptoes and
push your bottoms up and out for maximum exposure. Good." Talbot moved
over and pressed the two bottoms more closely together.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Do not move from this position until I
tell you to do so."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">{Oh, God, here it comes, and now I have the urge
to pee.} Kate thought frantically. {If I start the school year by peeing on the
teacher's desk in my first class, I am doomed forever. I might as well enter a
convent. But Methodists don't have convents, do they? Well if they do, they
probably spank girls there, too.}</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Talbot drew back his arm and let fly with the
first stroke. It struck Connie full on the center of her buttocks and both
girls screamed. The next stroke on Kate's bottom produced the same results. Talbot
spanked at a steady pace with surprising strength for a small man. the girls
noticed almost immediately that the long ruler caused the spanks to overlap
bottoms so that Connie received a partial spank every time Kate got a full
spank and vice versa. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Both girls were weeping by the tenth spank and
their bottoms were squirming in unison like a synchronized swimming team. This
observation brought a broad smile to Mr. Talbot's face and more covert smiles
to the class members who were wary about joining the two victims over the desk.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate got one penalty stroke for lifting her
upper body off the desk, but Connie was able to withstand the full twenty-three
strokes. Both girls were bawling uncontrollably by that time and they were
slumped over the desk in a state of exhaustion. Talbot stepped up and ran his
hands over both hot red bottoms, stroking, rubbing and patting here and there.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"You took your punishment quite well,
children," he stated. "You may now stand up and return to your
seats." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">They stood up shakily and rubbed their sore
bottoms. Kate reached down and drew up her panties to cover as much as
possible.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Just a moment, Miss Brady," Talbot
remarked sharply, &#8220;Just what do you think you are doing?" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"P-p-p-pulling up my panties, Sir,"
Kate stammered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Were you told to pull up your panties,
Miss Brady?" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"N-N-N-No, Sir."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Then don't do it. Now bend over the desk
again."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate gave out a stifled sob and resumed the
hated position. Talbot stepped forward and pulled her panties back down. He
then delivered two very hard spanks with the ruler - aimed at the junction
between bottom and thighs. Kate yowled in pain and frustration.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Stand up, Miss Brady." Talbot said
calmly. "Now both you girls will keep your panties at half-mast and your
skirts tucked into your waistbands for the duration of the class. There is
nothing quite like the feeling of a freshly spanked bare bottom on a hard-wooden
chair to remind a young lady of her responsibilities."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"When you leave the classroom, and are out
in the hallway, you may pull your panties back up to their normal position. You
will, however, keep your skirts tucked up and your panties exposed until you
enter your next classroom. I will provide each of you with a note for your next
teacher. He or she will verify that my orders are carried out. If not, you will
find yourself back in the same position next class. Is that perfectly
clear?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Sir," both girls meekly replied.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate and Connie squirmed uncomfortably through
the rest of the class and made a point of walking very slowly out of the
classroom when the next bell rang. Once in the hallway, they stopped to examine
the damage on each other's bottom before pulling up their panties.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Wow, that&#8217;s gotta be burning something
fierce, Connie said. "I know mine is." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, it's a major fire for sure,"
Kate replied. "Where is your next class?'</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
