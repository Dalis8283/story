<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Kate&#8221; is Katherine Rose Brady, 18 years
old, from Long Island, New York. She has just entered the freshman class at
McClintock College, located in a small town "a few miles off the
four-lane" in the rural West. Kate's parents separated when she was quite
young and she has grown up with a lack of strong male figures in her life. She
is 5'1'' with a tiny waist and full hips, (what some call a "very
spankable bottom"). Being small and baby-faced, she is often treated as
being much younger than her real age. Kate is quite intelligent when she wants
to be, but is a born-again procrastinator, which often gets her into trouble
with schoolwork. Her personality is described by some as "frisky",
"spirited" or "playful." Others have been known to use the
terms "mischievous," "immature" and 'bratty." Kate has
not been subject to much discipline in her life and has come to realize that
she probably needs a strong hand, appropriately placed, to keep her in line. This
is the major reason she agreed to go to McClintock College.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">McClintock College is a small liberal arts
college founded as a girls-only school in the 19th century by a retired cattle
rancher who believed in strict discipline for young ladies. There is an
exchange program with nearby Bridger Military Academy a mostly male school some
20 miles away. A few male cadets attend McClintok morning classes and a few
upper-level girls from McClintok take science labs in the afternoons at
Bridger. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">McClintok has a school uniform for girls, which
they wear at all times on campus except to gym classes. It consists of: black
and gold skirt, white blouse, gold regulation panties, black blazer with school
logo on left breast, black and gold diagonal stripped tie, gold knee socks,
white and black Mary Janes. Uniform regulations are rigorously enforced except
in the dorms where a more relaxed atmosphere prevails. The girls also wear
regulation 2 piece pajamas, which are "ski pajama" like (without
feet) and are gold with a black school logo on the tops and thin, close fitting
bottoms. PJ&#8217;s are worn with rubber-soled slippers. The Gym uniform is a light
shade of green-gold with a loose-fitting blouse and bloomers. Worn with white
athletic socks and black and gold tennis shoes.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">All girls who enter McClintok must sign a waiver
in which they agree to accept "reasonable" corporal punishment for
their misdeeds. Parents and/or guardians also sign the waiver. Boys from
Bridger are not spanked at McClintock and girls from McClintock are not spanked
at Bridger. If a student gets into trouble at the &#8216;other&#8221; school, he or she is
reported to the appropriate &#8220;home&#8221; school. School faculty and staff at
McClintock are permitted to spank students on the panties or bare bottom with
their hands or school-approved instruments. </span>

across the hall from Kate, Kara has long blonde hair, stands 5-7" and is

toward the younger girls.</span>

responsibility for 48 freshman girls. (NOTE: Junior faculty members at
McClintok are not well paid, so often take additional jobs as counselors for
the free apartment and dining room privileges. Most consider it a fringe
benefit to be able to spank naughty young girls.)</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Come on, Kate. we're going to be late for
the fitting," Rachel pleaded to her new roommate. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I'm coming, I'm coming," Kate
responded irritably. "I just can't decide between the pearl and the topaz
earrings. Which goes better with this outfit?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"This stupid 'outfit' is just a God-damned
oversize gold tee shirt they gave us to cover the fact that we're just wearing
bra and panties for the uniform fitting, " her exasperated roommate
snapped. "You're going to get us both spanked on our first day of
Orientation."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Don't be silly, Rachel," Kate
laughed. "They won't spank us for something that trivial. Spankings are
for things like missing curfews, cheating on tests or not doing homework."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I hope you're right," Rachel said,
"but I wouldn't count on it - and we're already ten minutes late."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The two girls scurried from their room and down
the hall to the main lounge. They felt a bit silly in their huge gold tee
shirts, but it was better than running around in nothing but underwear. The
main lounge was empty, but a sign saying "Fitting" pointed down the
west hallway. Kate could see two girls in gold T-shirts standing outside a room
toward the end of the hallway. They hurried to join them, but the girls entered
the room and the door closed behind them before Kate and Rachel could catch up.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate tried the door, but it was locked. "Oh
shit," she said. "Now what?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Just knock on the door, dummy, "
Rachel said impatiently.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">At that point, there was a sound like a slap
from the other side of the door, followed by a girlish yelp. this was repeated
three more times in two different voices.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"I knew it," Rachel wailed.
"Those girls are getting spanked and we're next!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate sighed, but knocked anyway. The door opened
and she was looking at Gail Weathers, their Dorm Counselor. Her husband,
Warren, stood behind her in the room. Two girls in gold tee shirts stood
against the far wall, one was rubbing her bottom. Kate noticed in dismay that
Warren was holding a long, narrow spanking paddle.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail checked her clipboard. "Katherine Brady
and Rachel Miller, right?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, Ma'am," the two girls chorused.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail made a notation on the clipboard. "OK
Katherine, step forward, turn around and lift up the back of your shirt. Fifteen
minutes late, three strokes on the panties."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Oh shit!" Kate exclaimed
involuntarily.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail made another mark on the clipboard:
"Foul language, two more strokes, total of five, all on the bare."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate dropped the hem of her shirt and held both
hands firmly over her bottom. "No way!" she protested.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail made another note. "Resisting
punishment, Five additional strokes, ten in total, all on the bare."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate stood dumbfounded. This was a disaster! She
took two steps toward Warren and started to cry. Warren shook his head, smiled
sympathetically and guided her into place, pressing his left hand into the
small of her back to bend her over. He then lifted up the hem of her shirt to
reveal her pantied bottom. Murmuring, "Don't make it any worse, little
girl.," he pulled her panties down just far enough to expose her full
bottom."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate cried harder.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Warren drew back his arm and laid the paddle
squarely on the center of her left rump cheek.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate yelped and would have jumped away if his
hand was not keeping her bent over. The professor then carefully placed nine
more paddle swats on the bawling girl's ample bottom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate howled, sobbed and pleaded for mercy to no
avail. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When the tenth stroke had landed, Warren pulled
up her panties and motioned her over to the wall to join the other two girls.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail checked her clipboard and made another
mark. "Rachel Miller, fifteen minutes late, three strokes on the
panties." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Having observed the fate of her roommate, Rachel
stepped forward, bent over and flipped up the tail of her shirt. Warren took
aim and gave her three hard, rapid smacks on the seat of her panties. Rachel
yelped at each stroke, but kept her composure and was only sniffling a bit when
she joined the other three girls against the wall.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"OK girls, turn around and face me,"
Gail ordered authoritatively. "You are not off to a good start. You were
late to your very first appointment and that is something we do not tolerate
here. You now know the penalty for tardiness and one of you has learned the
penalty for using bad language and resisting punishment."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"What you experienced today was just a
token punishment. Most of your spankings will be over the knee and of much
longer duration. We don't expect that you will be perfect little girls all the
time, you will make errors and be punished appropriately. But what we do expect
is that you will not keep making stupid little mistakes like you did this
morning."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"The other girls from your corridor, the
ones who were on time and obedient, are being fitted for their uniforms now. You
four will wait here until they are finished, and then you will get your
fittings. This means that you will probably miss most of your free time this
morning, another result of your irresponsibility. We will come back and get you
when it is your turn."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"If you need to use the bathroom, there is
one behind the door to your left. Katherine, I suggest you wash your face
before the other girls see you. And definitely wash off that ridiculous eye
makeup that is running down your cheeks. It's the wrong colour for you and eye
makeup is not permitted for freshman girls here. The rest of you stand facing
the wall until I come back to get you. You may talk in low voices and you may
rub your bottoms if you wish. Any questions?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"No, ma'am," came back four voices in
nervous disharmony.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Good, try not to get lost." The young
woman said sarcastically as she and her husband left the room.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">There was a moment of silence and then Rachel
spoke up. "Nice going, Kate, you got us spanked on our very first day -
actually our very first appointment."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"Hey, don't complain," Kate protested.
"You just got three spanks on the panties. I got TEN spanks on the
bare."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">One of the other girls spoke up. "We only
got two spanks each on the panties. But we were only ten minutes late."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Rachel smiled. "I'm Rachel Miller, and this
silly child is Kate Brady. We are roommates."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The blonde girl smiled. "I'm Kara Floyd and
this is Laura Campbell - we're roommates too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The girls discovered to their delight that they
were all sharing the common room and facilities at the end of their corridor. They
chatted for a few minutes while Kate rubbed her sore bottom. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"It sounded like you got it really
good," Kara said, sympathetically. "Let's take a look at your
bottom."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate blushed, but lifted up her shirt and
lowered the back of her panties. The other girls clustered around and made
little noises of sympathy. Laura said, "I wish we had some cream to put on
that, it looks kind of rough."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">At that moment, the door opened and Gail came
back in. "Good Grief," she exclaimed, "what are you children
doing? You look like a bunch of six-year-olds comparing bottoms." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The girls froze and blushed in unison. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail shook her head. "Well, I guess I'd
better give you something to compare. Kate, leave your panties where they are.
The rest of you girls pull down your panties so they match Kate's. And pull up
your shirts and bend over." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Warren walked into the room and smiled at the
sight of four quivering bare bottoms. "Again, already?" he asked.
"These kids are really something." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail laughed. "Yep they are gonna be a
handful, good thing we have them all together at the end of the corridor. The
daily spankings won't disturb the good girls too much." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Warren agreed. "Yes, we'll need to give
them special attention. Hand spanking on the bare this time?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Gail
nodded, &#8220;A dozen apiece should do it. Your hand is bigger and harder than mine,
so you can do the honors." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate's bottom cheeks clenched in anticipation,
but she said nothing as the tall professor pulled her shirt up, encircled her
waist with his left arm and rested his big right hand on her already pink-red
bottom. He patted her cringing bottom a few times and then gave a full-strength
SWAT that covered both her bottom cheeks and brought forth a loud yelp. By the
fourth spank she was bawling and squirming, so he lifted her up slightly so
that her toes were barely touching the floor and her bottom was fully exposed. A
few swats to her thighs below the bunched-up panties brought more yelps and a
frantic toe dance that caused her bottom to bounce around delightfully. He
finished up with a series of four spanks to the sit-spot and released the
blubbering teen. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate sank to the floor and wailed in pain and
humiliation. Gail helped her to her feet, rolled up her shirt bottom so it
would stay in place and pulled up the front of her panties to cover her private
parts while leaving her bottom bare. "OK, Katie, over to the wall, hands
on head and no rubbing." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kara was next. She was much taller than Kate,
but her bottom was rather slim and boyish.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Tucked under Warren's arm, however, she was
still very much a little girl and she was crying before the first smack. Warren's
hand covered her entire bottom and he actually had to cup it a bit to avoid
overlapping onto her hips. The first hard smack brought forth a loud screech
and subsequent smacks turned her very pale bottom a bright red and elicited
more yelps, tears and wails. Kara, despite her bravado when other girls were
involved, lost all control while being spanked and Warren hand to hold her
waist tightly to keep her from collapsing by the tenth spank. The last two
spanks, delivered to the sit-spot, caused the wailing teen to run frantically
in place and at one point both her feet were off the floor, almost resulting in
knocking her spanker off his feet. Released from his firm grip, she ran around
the room doing the "spanked girl dance" with full sound effects. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">As Gail was readjusting Kara's clothing and
putting her next to Kate against the wall, Laura turned bright red and blurted
out. "Dr. Weathers, I have to go to the potty, right now!" She was
obviously in distress, crossing her legs and writhing in embarrassed agony.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Warren laughed. "Well, I don't want to have
to change my pants and I am sure the janitor would not appreciate a puddle on
the floor so go ahead. But don&#8217;t take too long and be sure to wipe
carefully."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Laura flushed even redder and barely managed to
choke out, "Thank you, Sir," before dashing into the little bathroom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Warren beckoned to Rachel. Determined to
maintain her dignity as long as possible, she walked calmly over to the tall
counselor and bent over next to him. Warren admired her classic proportions and
demeanor as he took a firm grip and patted her bottom. But when the first solid
SMACK landed, Rachel jumped and yelped, just as the others had done. She was
crying by the fifth spank and bawling and hiccupping by the tenth. Like the
others, the final two spanks on her sit-spot brought forth squeals and frantic
footwork. But she walked over to the wall on her own and allowed Gail to adjust
her meager garments without comment or resistance. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">There was the sound of flushing water and Laura
came out of the bathroom, already crying her eyes out. When Gail stopped her,
and pulled open her bottom cheeks to "check for proper wiping," the
humiliated girl redoubled her sobbing. She was blubbering from the first spank
as Warren reddened her bottom and was virtually limp when he finished. Gail and
Warren helped her to the wall and let her lean on it to recover her breath and
strength. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Gail smiled at Warren. "I am not sure
whether we should take these silly little children into the next room for
uniforms or down to the Day Care Center for diapers." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The four punished teens said nothing but each
was privately considering murder and/or torture for their counselors. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">When the four chastened girls had recovered
somewhat, Gail led them through the door into the fitting room. They were met
by three older girls in immaculate school uniforms and a rather tired looking
middle-aged woman with a tape measure. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"OK, girls," Gail said. "Here we
have bins of panties in various sizes, bras over here, skirts on the hangers
over there and blouses on the racks against the far wall. Hopefully, you all
know your sizes, but we need to check them anyway. These are all used clothes
left over from last year, but they will get you through the day. Once we have
your sizes, the campus store will deliver your full uniform issue to the dorms
tomorrow morning. The only exception is your blazers. they will have to be
tailored, so it will take a week or so to get them to you. In the meantime, you
will be given a slip that says you can go without it." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"At this time, take off your shirt and
panties and put them in one of the plastic bags from this pile. You were told
to wear a plain white bra; I will check it to make sure that it is within
specifications. When you find a pair of panties that fit properly, report to
Martha - the girl with the red bow in her hair. Then, go on over to the bra
section and see Jennifer - the blonde girl. Then go over to Sharon and have her
help you select a blouse. Finally, Mrs. Higgins will measure you for your
blazer and fit you with a skirt." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"At McClintok, skirt length is an
indication of class status. Senior girls wear skirts that are between one and
two inches above the knee when standing. Sophomore and junior girls wear skirts
that are between two and three inches above the knee. Freshman girls, like you,
wear skirts that are at least four inches above the knees. Among other things,
this makes it easier to expose your bottoms for spankings." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">The four girls quickly doffed their shirts and
panties and moved over to Gail who checked their bras. "Kara, this bra is
padded, that is not allowed here, please remove it and put it in your
bag." </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kara blushed and removed the offending garment,
leaving her completely nude except for her shoes and socks. Gail laughed and
smacked her bright red bottom. "Ok go get some undies on, silly
girl."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Laura also flunked the bra check, &#8220;This is pink
and too fancy for school. Take it off and follow Kara."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Kate and Rachel were spared this further
embarrassment but were profoundly grateful there were no males in the room. They
found panties in the proper size and slipped them on gratefully. Kate noted
that the panties were high cut and would expose a fair amount of bottom cheek
even in the normal position. This did not bode well for modesty when bending
over or climbing stairs, and even less for spankings. Blouses were easy and
skirts were not much of a problem, although the skirt Kate received was a bit
shorter than she would prefer, she figured she would get used to it.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Finally, all four girls were properly dressed,
minus the blazers. Gail lined them up and gave them a quick inspection. "OK
that is acceptable for now. Let&#8217;s go get some lunch and we'll meet with the
others in the main lounge at 1:00 sharp. And you four had better be there on
time or those panties will be coming down again. Now scoot."</span>
