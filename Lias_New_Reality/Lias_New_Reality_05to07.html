<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lia's new reality</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> <br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Part 5</span><br> <br> <br>
The day had gone well for Lia; the trip to Trevor's campus and the time
spent on campus were uneventful. Lia had been on her best behavior; her
mom had threatened to take her clothes away while on campus, and Lia
took this seriously. After the stunt she pulled with Carol yesterday,
she knew she was on thin ice and didn't want to fall through. Her
parents had allowed Mike, the cute young intern who worked for her
father, to see her in all her naked glory. But not only that, she had
to adopt the humiliating position of putting her arms behind her head
and her legs standing apart. Mike got very familiar with Lia's
previously private areas. So she knew that both her parents didn't have
any reservations about getting her naked in front of others.<br> <br> Today it was just Lia, her parents, and Trevor. Chuck was staying the night with Gil.<br> <br>
Lia didn't pack her own bag for this overnight trip; she didn't have
any clothes in her room anymore after all. Her mother assured her that
she had packed something for Lia to wear the next day. Today Lia was
given a tank top, jeans, and, of course, underwear. It was actually
nice to not have to worry about packaging. Like many other 15-year-old
girls, Lia struggled to decide what to pack, even for a quick trip like
this one. But unlike other girls; her clothes could be taken from her
at the drop of a hat. Everyone in her family had this power over her,
even Chuck. She suspected, though, that her parents retained final
authority whenever they were around. Her older brother, Trevor, was the
only one that hadn't taken her clothes from her; technically, her dad
had not done so either, but he was there when her mom did, so he might
as well have.<br> <br> Back at the hotel room, after a long day on
campus, Lia was laying in bed watching TV while Trevor and her parents
discussed his upcoming freshman year at college in the next room. Her
parents had two rooms that were connected by a door in the middle. The
hotel they were at was nice. Indoor pool, large workout room, and
several conference rooms. There were a lot of people at the hotel, a
combination of other parents visiting the college with their kids, and
there was at least one conference in town, but Lia wasn't sure what it
was for. Something political, but she never heard of it before.
Something to do with liberty<br> <br> The conversation in the other
room had turned from college stuff to Trevor convincing his parents to
take the night out for themselves.<br> <br> "With Dad's campaign and
work, you two don't get to go out much. Lia and I can hang out here;
we'll grab dinner in the restaurant or something."<br> <br> Her parents
had agreed and decided to go out for dinner and probably a few drinks
in town, leaving her and her brother at the hotel.<br> <br> <br> The
evening was still young, and about 30 minutes later, Lia's parents left
for their date. Lia's mom left with some departing words that made Lia
slightly nervous. "Trevor is in charge."<br> <br> Trevor lay in the other bed, watching TV and engaging in small talk with Lia. It was all very normal, and Lia began to relax.<br> <br>
"It was silly to be nervous." Lia thought to herself. "My punishment
probably isn't even on his mind after the events of today."<br> <br>
The conversation died down, and the siblings watched TV for about
another 10 minutes. Then suddenly, Trevor got up, dug into his bag,
pulled something out, and then went into the bathroom. He came back out
minutes later wearing swim trunks and a T-shirt.<br> <br> "I'm bored and hungry; let's grab a bite, then hit the pool."<br> <br> "Well, I can eat, but I'm not going swimming." Lia replied, sitting up and looking for her shoes.<br> <br> "Sure you are; you'll have fun. They have a huge pool; there is even a hot tub we can use."<br> <br> "Trevor, I can't go swimming; I don't have a bikini anymore."<br> <br> "I know, you destroyed it to prank poor Carol. You can just swim in what you wore yesterday."<br> <br> Lia's eyes went as wide as saucers. "But I wasn't wearing anything yesterday."<br> <br> "Personally, I think it's the best swimsuit you've ever had." Trevor said it with a huge, ear-to-ear smile.<br> <br> "Trevor please! I can't go down there naked!"<br> <br> "You won't be naked; you'll be wearing your new swimsuit, all natural and very eco-friendly."<br> <br> Lia shot up and ran to her brother, putting her hands together in a begging fashion, and tears began to well in her eyes.<br> <br>
"Please, please, don't make me go down there naked, please! I'll get
naked in the room if you want! But please don't make me leave the room!"<br> <br>
Lia felt her brother's arms close around her in a hug. Her brother was
very big and strong, and it actually made Lia feel a small level of
comfort.<br> <br> "Shhh, now, sis, don't cry." Trevor brushed her hair
out of her face. He could be quite paternal when he wanted to be. "At
first, I was angry with you; you put mom and dad through hell with how
much they worried about you. And then what you did to Carol was harsh.
But I've cooled off, and now that I'm trying to help you, you'll
probably enjoy it."<br> <br> "Enjoy it? How could you possibly think that I would enjoy it?"<br> <br>
"You can't fool me, sis." Trevor replied, breaking the hug. "I can tell
you are turned on by the exposure. I'm not blind. And I'm pretty sure
Mom and Dad can see it too."<br> <br> "No, I'm not! How could you even say that? Being naked is awful!"<br> <br> "You don't have to lie to me, sis; I saw how much you let Gil look at you. And from behind too, that's quite a view he got."<br> <br>
"I was….that's….it's not true! I don't enjoy this! And besides, I can't
go out there naked; I'll get arrested! Or someone will assault me!"<br> <br> "No, you won't trust me."<br> <br> "If you are so sure, then why don't you go out there naked too?" Lia was getting increasingly desperate to deswade her brother.<br> <br>
"I can't, see because I'm a guy; no one wants to see a dick flopping
around. It could be threatening to women, but a cute little girl like
yourself? People won't mind much."<br> <br> Lia couldn't believe Trevor
was actually making the argument that it was more okay for her to be
naked than him, simply because she was a girl.<br> <br> "I'm not a little girl!"<br> <br>
"True, but you are cute, especially when naked." Trevor patted the top
of Lia's head. "Look, sis, I don't make the rules of society; the fact
is that you being naked is much more acceptable because you are such a
cute girl. You might get some other women annoyed at you, but that's
it. And no one is going to assault you; I'll be with you and look at
me." Trevor took a step back. He was 6'2 with a fair amount of muscle.
"No one will try anything while I'm with you."<br> <br> The physical
disparity between them was vast; Lia was a small 5'3 and very petite,
but still with a womanly figure. Her breasts were small, but she
couldn't really be mistaken for a little girl. She was very clearly a
teenager.<br> <br> "Can I have a shirt to wear until we get to the
pool? You're wearing a shirt, and I would be too if I wasn't being
punished and still had my bikini."<br> <br> Trevor contemplated for a
moment. "That's true, but your clothes are in Mom's bag, and I don't
think she'd want me going through it. I don't want to invade her
privacy."<br> <br> "Well can you give me a shirt?"<br> <br> "The only
shirt I have left that's clean is what I'm wearing tomorrow. Sorry,
sis, you'll just have to make do with your natural bikini."<br> <br>
Lia was sunk; she was about to leave the safety of the hotel room
completely naked. Her mother's words, "Trevor is in charge," echo in
her head. She would have to listen to him. She could detect a bit of
wetness between her legs already. "No way Trevor was right," she
thought to herself. "Just because her body reacted this way didn't mean
she liked it."<br> <br> "Come now; we are wasting time, and I'm hungry.
You know the rules by now. I am officially ordering you to remove your
clothes."<br> <br> Lia's heart was racing now, and her breathing was
fast-paced. She turned from Trevor and slowly lifted her shirt another
head and off. Her fingers trembled as she unbuttoned her pants. These
were the type of pants that didn't have a zipper, just a series of
buttons, each one harder to unfasten than the one before it. Once her
pants were off, she looked back over her shoulder at Trevor, pleading
with him to change his mind. But he said nothing. Turning back, Lia
reached back and unclasped her bra, discarding it. One more item left,
she placed her thumbs in the waistband of her panties and slowly inched
them down her legs. Her cute little apple-shaped butt came into view.
She discarded her panties with the rest of her clothes, covered her
breasts and bald pussy, and turned back towards her brother.<br> <br> "You know the rules, sis; no covering. Besides, this is a view I've seen many times."<br> <br>
Lia knew, but somehow this stripping felt almost worse than any of the
others. Stripping just for her brother was harder; she knew with Chuck
it was just funny to him, but Trevor was able to fully enjoy the nude
female form. She didn't think that Trevor was attracted to her, but he
was capable of it, and that made it harder. Trevor was probably the
worst member of her family to strip for alone. Lia would have even
preferred to have just her father there. It would still be very
embarrassing to have to strip for her dad, but she knew he wouldn't run
lustful eyes over her. Trevor had a hint of that now—not much, but
enough. Still, she dropped her arms and let him look. She watched as he
ran his eyes up and down her nude body, stopping at her freshly shaved
pussy.<br> <br> Trevor took his time, drinking in his sister's naked
form. She was quite stunning naked. Her small breasts were perfectly
symmetrical; they held themselves up nicely. If it weren't for the fact
that her little pink nipples would poke holes right through her shirt,
he would say that she didn't need a bra. Speaking of her nipples, they
were as hard as ever, and he thought that they might be able to cut
glass. His eyes traveled down her body to her flat tummy and her cute
belly button. Further down his eyes went to the main event, her puffy
little pussy. It seemed slightly swollen with arousal already. Her
little thigh gap made it impossible for her to hide it, even if she
kept her legs together. Bringing his gaze back up to her face, the
whole package was tired of the pouty look she had on. Trevor couldn't
deny it; his sister was stunning. He was grateful that he suggested
nudity to their parents as a form of punishment, it was meant as a joke
but he was glad that they took it seriously. He focused on her pussy
again, noting that she was aroused. He was now convinced that Lia, on
some level, enjoyed having her clothes taken from her.<br> <br> "You want to know how I know you like your punishment? You keep shaving your pussy. I think you want us to see it."<br> <br> "That's not true! Stop being a perv!"<br> <br> "Mom never said you had to keep shaving; you do that all on your own."<br> <br>
The truth is, Lia wasn't sure why she kept shaving her pussy. It
couldn't be because of what Trevor said, could it? "No," she thought.
"Of course not!" And she wasn't going to stop because Trevor said
anything either. She liked to be shaved, and she was going to keep
doing it. She detected more wetness.<br> <br> "Shut up! That's not true; I just... don't want to leave hair anywhere; pubic hair falls out all the time."<br> <br> His pink nipples were rock hard, pointing directly at Trevor, almost begging to be looked at.<br> <br> "Sure, sis, whatever you say. Ok, let's go."<br> <br> Lia followed Trevor to the door. He stopped at the bathroom.<br> <br> "Oh wait! Almost forgot."<br> <br>
He went into the bathroom and came back out with a towel. Lia's heart
almost skipped. For a brief moment, she thought Trevor was about to
hand her the towel, but he instead slung it over his shoulder.
"Alright, let's go."<br> <br> He led the naked Lia into the hallway and
shut the door behind her. She was stuck now. She didn't have the hotel
key; Trevor was her only way back in.<br> <br> The feeling was surreal,
standing naked in a hotel hallway. Up until now, Lia had only been
naked at home; even being outside in her backyard wasn't as bad as
this. Being naked on your own property, even outside, could be excused
and explained, but not here. Lia was in a place where she should have
been dressed, and everyone knows she should be dressed. But she wasn't;
she was completely and utterly naked. She didn't even have shoes.
Thankfully, no one was in the hallway.<br> <br> Trevor took off at a brisk pace towards the elevator, like it was completely normal to have his naked sister by his side.<br> <br> Lia made one last effort to be covered.<br> <br> "Trevor, could I please wear the towel? At least until we get to the pool? I'll take it off there, I swear."<br> <br>
"No, I can do it, sis." He replied without breaking his stride.
"Besides, you'd look ridiculous wearing just a towel." He stopped and
placed a hand on her shoulder. She thought he would be angry, but
instead he had a sincere look on his face. "Just act confidently, like
you would if you had clothes on, and don't cover yourself or look
embarrassed, and I promise you you'll be ok."<br> <br> Lia nodded, and
they resumed walking towards the elevator. Her legs felt like jelly,
and her heart was beating out of her chest. She was about to walk
through the hotel naked as the day she was born. Hairless from the
eyebrows down.<br> <br> Trevor was walking so quickly, and with long
strides, Lia had to almost jog to keep up, her small breasts bouncing
with every step. She could even feel her butt juggling; she kept
looking back to see if anyone was behind them. Thankfully, no one was.<br> <br> "If anyone says anything to us, just let me do the talking."<br> <br>
Lia was totally fine with that; if she had to be naked in public, then
her brother should have to be the one to explain it; it was his doing
after all.<br> <br> They made it to the elevators without any problems.
So far, Lia had been lucky to not be seen, but she knew that luck would
run out very soon. There was no way she wouldn't be seen; she wasn't
sure what exactly lay ahead of her, but Trevor was about to march her,
naked, through a very busy hotel.<br> <br> The elevator doors opened
from there on the top floor. There was no one inside, but the site had
caused Lia's anxiety to spike. The elevator walls were basically
mirrors; she could see exactly what she looked like. Up until now, her
mind didn't fully accept what she was about to do, but seeing her own
nude form standing in front of her really hammered it home. She could
see, even feet away, how hard her nipples were and how red and puffy
her lower lips had become. Her arousal was obvious.<br> <br> "Trevor please! I'll do anything! Don't make me go down there like this!"<br> <br> "It's ok, Lia." Trevor spoke softly, placing a hand on her back. "Let's go." He nudged her softly forward.<br> <br> Not resisting his nudging, they both stepped into the elevator.<br> <br>
Trevor guided Lia to the center of the elevator; with mirrors on every
side, Lia could see all angles of herself. Her own frontal features she
knew well, but now she could see her tight, well-toned butt without
straining. Trevor was offering no mercy; when this elevator reached the
bottom floor, complete strangers would get to know these features too,
but her ordeal would start sooner than expected.<br> <br> "Hold the door, please!" I heard a voice from around the corner.<br> <br>
The elevator doors had just been about to close when Trevor shot his
hand through and allowed the doors to open back up. He held his hand on
the door to keep them open for whoever just called.<br> <br> "Remember, Lia, be confident, and no covering up." He spoke softly.<br> <br> The man who called to halt the elevator came jogging in, slightly out of breath.<br> <br> "Thank you; I'm already running late, and these damn...whoa, young miss? I think you forgot something in your room."<br> <br>
The man seemed to be in his 60s, very well dressed, and had a warm
smile on his face. He stood right in front of Lia, looking her up and
down. Lia stood firm with her hands and her sides, making eye contact
with this stranger.<br> <br> "Don't mind my sister, sir; she hasn't
forgotten anything. She is like this by choice, and it took her hours
to work up the courage."<br> <br> "Is that so?" The man replied. Again,
looking Lia up and down. The elevator doors had closed, and with every
wall being a mirror, this stranger had a complete 360-degree view of
her.<br> <br> "Yes sir… I chose to be like this." Lia meekly replied, deciding to follow Trevor's lead.<br> <br> "Young lady, forgive me, but I must ask, why have you chosen to be naked?" The man asked.<br> <br>
Lia didn't know how to answer this; of course she didn't choose this,
but she had to go along with Trevor's plan now. Her confidence failed
her as she just bit her lower lip and stared into the man's eyes.<br> <br>
"Please excuse my sister; she's very shy, but she believes strongly in
what she's doing. You see, she is making a political statement with her
nudity. She believes that our high school's dress code is very unfair
to girls. She believes that a girl should be able to choose whatever
she wants to wear and not have to worry about being a distraction. Even
if a girl chooses to be naked,<br> <br> "I see." Said the man, turning
his gaze from Lia to Trevor, then back to Lia. "This wouldn't have
anything to do with the libertarian convention downstairs, would it?"<br> <br>
"Actually, that's exactly why we are here." Trevor replied. We know
that a convention like this is not really the best place to make a
statement about an unfair school dress code, but Lia is hoping to make
a statement about women's rights in general."<br> <br> "No need to
explain to me, young man; to see a young person believe so strongly in
her right to decide for herself fills me with hope for our future." The
man smiled warmly at Lia.<br> <br> It was then that Lia realized that,
even though this older man had been eyeing her up and down, he didn't
have a creepy way about him. He even looked as though he had pride
behind his smile. This actually made Lia feel a little better, and she
returned his smile with one of her own.<br> <br> "I'm actually one of
the organizers of the convention." The man said, "My name is Devon, and
it's a pleasure to meet you, Lia, was it?" Holding out his hand.<br> <br>
Lia managed to shake it. "Yes, sir, and this is my brother Trevor; he's
helping me." She almost couldn't believe her own words. She should have
told this man that Trevor was forcing her to be naked and beg him for
help. Something told her that he probably would've helped her if she
asked. Devon had a nice way about him, and he seemed gentle. But she
didn't tell the truth; she would continue with Trevor's game and her
nudity.<br> <br> "I must say,I have not seen anyone take such bold
action before, but I admire your courage. If even a third of our party
had your conviction, we'd have the White House by now. Oh, but I'm
running late; press main floor' for me, will you?"<br> <br> They hadn't
even been moving that whole time. Lia had to endure the ride down
still, and even though the man, Devon, had not been looking directly at
her now, with the walls, he could see her no matter where he looked.<br> <br>
As the elevator came to a stop and the doors opened, Devon turned back
to Lia. "I do hope to see you at the convention; there are other young
people in attendance who I'm sure would be glad to meet you." With
that, he turned and left.<br> <br> That small interaction was such a
rush for Lia; her heart was still pounding. A complete stranger had
just seen her entire naked body. Her mind was desperate to reject what
her body was feeling. She couldn't understand why she reacted this way;
she wanted nothing more than to go back to the room and hide.<br> <br> Now Lia's ordeal would truly begin. The elevators were around the corner from the main lobby, so she was not visible just yet.<br> <br> "That was great, Lia! See, I told you to just act confident and you'd be fine."<br> <br> "We aren't going to that convention, are we"? <br> <br> "No, we'll just go to the restaurant and then go for a swim."<br> <br> "The restaurant!? I can't go like this! They'll never let us in!"<br> <br> "Remember, Lia, confidence. Now let's go."<br> <br>
Trevor took off towards the lobby, and Lia had no choice but to follow.
She could hear the slapping of her bare feet on the cold floor. I kept
reminding her of her reality, never letting her forget that she was
naked and far from the safety of her room and clothes. But she could
hear another thing: the sound of many voices coming from around the
corner. They would have to cross right through the lobby to get to the
restaurant.<br> <br> Lia's heart was pounding with each step, and the
wetness between her legs seemed to increase with each slap of her foot
on the floor. Soon, her moisture would be running down her legs. The
two teens turned the corner into the lobby. It was quite crowded.
People in line to check in are fiddling with bags, and parents are
trying to corral their kids. It seemed to be a busy season for this
place.<br> <br> Trevor didn't stop or try to walk around the lobby for
a more private path; he just started marching straight through. Lia
knew if she stopped walking, she may never be able to start again. She
didn't want to jog to keep up with Trevor this time; she knew her
bouncy bits would draw far too much attention. She opted to fall behind
slightly but still maintain a fast pace.<br> <br> It didn't really matter in the end; she was seen almost immediately as she made her way through the crowded lobby.<br> <br> "Woah dude! Check it out!"<br> <br> "What the hell!"<br> <br> "Mommy, what is that girl doing?"<br> <br>
Lia heard many other comments. Nearly every eye was watching her as she
moved through the lobby. She was unable to stare straight ahead; she
looked around at a lot of faces looking back at her. The expressions
ranged from wide smiles (by far the most) to shock, and only a few were
disgusted, mostly from younger women who had a man with them. She
received a very warm smile and a nod from a little old lady in a
wheelchair. This old woman must have been in her 90s, and was way past
holding to social decorum, and was enjoying the antics of youth. Lia
had tried to keep a straight face but was able to genuinely smile back
at the old lady.<br> <br> The worst part of the walk had been that
nearly all conversations had died off and the lobby became quiet, aside
from the comments she heard and the slapping of her bare feet on the
floor. The sound of every slap would be burned into Lia's mind forever.
She had been naked in front of others before, but this was her first
naked experience in public, and every second felt like a minute.<br> <br>
Finally, Lia and Trevor had rounded the corner to the hallway leading
to the restaurant. Lia was back out of view of the lobby, and she was
surprised that no one stopped her; they didn't even follow her. Trevor
stopped to let her catch her breath. Lia was breathing hard; she felt
exhausted, like she had just run a mile. She had to lean her back
against the wall.<br> <br> "Oh my God... I…can't believe I…just did that!" Lia said, finally catching her breath.<br> <br> "See, I told you that you'd enjoy it." Trevor replied.<br> <br> "How could you possibly think I'd enjoy that?" Lia said it incredulously.<br> <br>
"Just look at yourself; you might be my sister, but I can tell when a
girl is turned on. And you are a horny mess right now, sis."<br> <br>
Lia looked down at her body. Her nipples were as hard as they've ever
been; that could be explained by the cold air of the lobby. But what
couldn't be explained by the cold air was her pussy; it was very red
and super puffy. There must have been a ton of blood rushing to that
area; it was a wonder Lia had any left going to her brain. Her little
clit was poking out. But the worst part had to be her legs; her juices
had run down both, and it was obvious that it was her own lubrication.
Her thighs and pussy were glistening with moisture. This was the most
aroused she had ever seen herself. Lia reached up with a shaky hand and
gently pinched her left nipple.<br> <br> "Ahhh….mmmph…" Lia had to bite
her lower lip to stop herself from crying out in pleasure. This had
only been her nipple; she couldn't imagine what touching her clit would
feel like.<br> <br> "You can tell me, sis. You like this, don't you?"<br> <br> Lia could feel herself getting annoyed with her brother. Her body and her mind were apparently not on the same page.<br> <br> "No, I do not like this! I can't explain why I react this way! Don't you get boners you can't control!? Same thing!" <br> <br>
"Suit yourself." Trevor was not convinced. He was certain his sister
was enjoying this on some level. "Come on, I'm hungry; let's go eat."<br> <br>
"Trevor, please; I can't take much more of this. Can we just go back
and order a pizza? I'll even answer the door naked for the delivery
boy."<br> <br> "I love your enthusiasm, but no, we are going here." He pointed to the restaurant door.<br> <br> "Well, can I at least dry myself off then?" Lia motioned her hands over her bare pussy and thighs.<br> <br>
Trevor thought for a moment, then answered. "No, you may not. I want
you to stay like this. Embarrassment is good for you. In fact, when we
get to a table, I don't want you using your napkins down there either."<br> <br> He didn't let her respond; he just turned and walked towards the doors.<br> <br>
Lia was in awe of his attitude towards her. First, he makes her strip
naked, walks through a crowded lobby, accuses her of being an
exhibitionist, and then won't let her clean herself up. She could only
follow her brother into the restaurant.<br> <br> They entered the doors
and approached the host booth. The man at the host booth stared
wide-eyed at Lia. Trevor stood up in the booth with Lia right by his
side, arms dangling at her sides, letting the man get a full frontal
view of her lady parts.<br> <br> "Table for two, please." Trevor said it with a smile.<br> <br>
"I'm sorry, sir." The host replied. "But your friend can't come into
this establishment dressed like that." His eyes seemed to point at
Lia's nakedness to accent the last word of his sentence.<br> <br>
"Excuse me, sir!" Trevor replied firmly. "My sister is dressed this way
for political reasons, and she has every right to dine here!"<br> <br> "I'm sorry, sir, but the young lady must be dressed to enter here." The host rebutted.<br> <br>
"We are attending the Libertarian convention here, and this is the
manner in which my sister has chosen to attend! She is here to make a
bold statement about the unfair dress standards imposed on women and
girls! Our father is a lawyer, and when he hears that your restaurant
was discriminating against her….” Trevor was putting on a good
performance. But it was drawing attention.<br> <br> Lia noticed that a
few groups seated near them were now staring at her. A few people had
also entered behind them and had been watching the scene unfold, along
with staring at Lia's little butt.<br> <br> "Please, sir, this
establishment does not discriminate on political grounds; please wait
here while I get the manager." The host didn't want to argue with
Trevor anymore. He didn't find Lia's antics cute either. As far as he
was concerned, this little tart should go parade here somewhere else.<br> <br> "Wait here." Trevor said this to Lia and marched off after the host, still arguing his case.<br> <br>
Lia couldn't believe Trevor had just left her there, completely naked,
at the entrance of a hotel's restaurant. Lia slowly turned to look at
the people behind her. The group was made up of three men and two
women, all seemed to be college aged, a bit older than Trevor. They
were all silently talking to one another while looking at Lia,
seemingly discussing different aspects of her nude body. They seem very
amused by Lia's nudity. They were even giggling with one another; they
didn't say anything to her, but one of the women gave her a thumbs up.
Lia did her best to smile and gave a little wave. She couldn't find the
energy to turn again, so she just stood there while they continued to
take in her nudity.<br> <br> She almost went into a trance; the more
this group looked at her, the deeper her trance seemed to go. It was
like her body had a mind of its own, keeping her planted facing them so
they could look all they wanted. The butterflies in her stomach were
going crazy. The tingling in her pussy intensified. It was like her
body took over and held her captive; she couldn't move and couldn't
cover. Her body knew the effects it had on others and forced her to let
them look. The wetness on her thigh was getting a new coat. These
strangers were getting to watch it happen.<br> <br> Finally, after what seemed like hours, Trevor finally returned.<br> <br> "Lia! Come on, we have a table."<br> <br> Lia was snapped back to reality. She trotted off to catch Trevor.<br> <br> "What happened?" She asked as they approached their small table towards the back of the restaurant.<br> <br>
"The manager was pretty cool about the whole thing, actually. He has no
problem with you eating here naked; you just can go near the salad bar,
so I'll get that for you if you want salad."<br> <br> Sitting down was a relief for Lia; she would be somewhat concealed.<br> <br> "Legs open, Lia; remember mom's rules. Not like that; wider, please."<br> <br> Lia sat with her legs spread wide. She was facing away from the rest of the restaurant, at least.<br> <br>
They ordered food; Lia got just a small appetizer and salad. She would
make Trevor get that for her. The waiter was a woman and, thankfully,
did not stare at her naked chest.<br> <br> As Trevor was leaving to get
her salad, she noticed that the five people she had her encounter with
at the entrance were seated at the next table behind her. Lia's face
became red with embarrassment, and she quickly turned away from them.<br> <br>
Lia sat there, thinking about how events led to her sitting naked and
alone in a hotel restaurant. She had no idea that sneaking out of her
house at night would lead to the most embarrassing situation of her
life. There was no way her parents would be okay with what Trevor was
doing to her now. Sure, they made her get naked, and her mom said she
should get used to the idea of being naked out of the house, but they
couldn't have meant for something like this to happen. She had every
intention of telling her parents about this. Lia knew if she ran to her
dad first and started crying, he would cave in and maybe even stop this
ridiculous punishment, perhaps even get Trevor in trouble in the
process.<br> <br> Trevor returned with a pretty impressive-looking salad for her.<br> <br> "Oh, look, your new friends are here." Trevor said, indicating the group of five behind Lia.<br> <br> "They aren't my friends; I don't know them."<br> <br> "Well, they seemed to be getting to know you pretty well a few minutes ago."<br> <br>
Lia didn't respond; she just started on her salad. Dinner was quiet
between the siblings. Just a normal meal in public between a brother
and sister, only the sister was completely naked.<br> <br> As they were finishing their meals, Trevor finally broke the silence between them.<br> <br> "Ya know, I've been thinking we should go to that convention after all. We can always go swimming after."<br> <br> Lia dropped her fork, staring wide-eyed at her brother.<br> <br> "You can't be serious. You can't possibly expect me to go that naked! There could be a hundred people there!"<br> <br>
"Probably two hundred, and you totally can go. In fact, they would
probably care less than the people in the lobby, or this restaurant."<br> <br> "Please, Trevor, haven't you put me through enough?"<br> <br> "You'll be fine; you saw how happy Devon was to meet you, right? We can't let him down. We have to go."<br> <br> "But I don't even know what a libertarian is! And I'm naked!"<br> <br> "Yeah, but you'll be okay. They'll love you!"<br> <br>
"What if they find out we're not Libertarian? They think I'm making fun
of them; they might call the cops if they figure out I'm not protesting
anything."<br> <br> "It's because you're naked that they won't find
out. No one is going to interrogate the ideas of a naked girl.
Especially one as cute as you."<br> <br> "But what if they do!? I can't fake something like this."<br> <br>
"Just stick to the protesting of the dress code thing, and you'll be
fine. If the conversation goes anywhere else, just say you hate taxes
and big government. Oh, and that you believe in the non-aggression
principle. You know we have a Libertarian club school? You should get
out more, sis. Well, maybe not; that's what landed you here in the
first place." Trevor wore a smirk on his face at that last part.<br> <br> "I'm your little sister! You should be protecting me, not showing me off to the world!"<br> <br>
"I am protecting you and showing you off. I won't let anyone hurt you.
One day you'll look back on this and thank me. And this might even be a
political awakening for you too."<br> <br> Lia knew there was no
arguing anymore. She was after all sitting naked in a restaurant; she
knew he was going to make her go to that conference too. Maybe he was
right, though; Devon seemed pretty open to her "protest." Maybe she
made it through.<br> <br> "I want to talk to your friends for a
second." Trevor got up and went to the table behind Lia, where the five
people she saw at the entrance sat. He leaded over their table and
talked so low that Lia couldn't hear them. Trevor would occasionally
look back at Lia, indicating to her that they were clearly talking
about her. Trevor and the group were all smiling; he was especially
engaging with two of them, a man and a woman. They seemed to be a
couple and were very interested in Lia.<br> <br> Finally, after several minutes, Trevor returned to Lia.<br> <br> "I need to go to the bathroom. I want you to stay here."<br> <br> Lia nodded.<br> <br> "Stand up for a second."<br> <br>
Lia stood, feeling ten pairs of eyes on her naked butt. Trevor took her
chair and turned it around to face the group at the table. He also
placed it about a foot closer to them.<br> <br> "Ok, you can sit down again."<br> <br>
Lia was past the point of being able to argue with him; she sat, now
facing the table with the five people. She had her legs closed.<br> <br> Trevor leaned down and whispered into her ear.<br> <br> "You know how you're supposed to sit, sis; it's ok, your friends won't mind."<br> <br>
Lia looked at him, pleading with her eyes. Trevor only nodded. Lia
slowly opened her legs a little wider. Trevor cleared his throat with
an expectant tone. She finally relented and spread her legs much wider.
The table of five now had a close and intimate view of Lia's glistening
pussy.<br> <br> "Just stay right here and don't close those legs; I'll
be right back." He patted her head and walked off. Leaving her lewdly
exposed to these strangers.<br> <br> Lia's breathing was becoming
ragged. She just looked at the faces at the other table. They were all
just drinking in her nudity. She was beginning to enter the trance
state again; her arms fell to her sides and hung uselessly. The
tingling in her pussy was incredible. The actions her brother took were
deliberately meant to expose her, and her body reacted to this face in
an intense fashion. Lia began to breathe heavily, her chest heaving up
and down.<br> <br> The two just stared at each other for minutes. The
two men and one woman were silently talking to one another, but the man
and woman at the other end had lustful looks in their eyes.<br> <br>
Finally, the woman, the one who gave her the thumbs up, got up, brought
her chair, and sat off to Lia's side so she didn't obstruct the view,
but sat facing her.<br> <br> "Hi sweetie, My name is Martha; what's yours?"<br> <br> "Li…. Lia…" Lia breathed out her name. The chest is still heaving.<br> <br>
"That's a cute name, a cute name for such a cute naked girl." Martha
said sweetly, brushing her hair behind Lia's ear. "I think it's brave
what you're doing; your brother told us you like to be seen, but you're
too scared to go alone. That was nice of him to go with you."<br> <br>
Lia didn't answer; she just looked at Martha, still breathing heavily.
Her brother must have told them she was an exhibitionist and liked what
she was doing. She didn't have the mental power to contradict him now.<br> <br>
"Most brothers wouldn't do this for their sisters; he must care about
you a lot." Martha placed an arm around the back of Lia's chair,
leaning in closer. "You see that guy there on the end?" Indicating that
the man is not whispering with the three others. "That's my boyfriend,
Gary. We think you are just the cutest thing we've ever seen. So
adorable." She again brushed through Lia's hair. "Give him a little
wave."<br> <br> Lia brought a shaky hand up and waved at Gary. He smiled wide and waved back.<br> <br>
Martha leaned in closer. "Do you want to know a secret? I love it when
Gary looks at a naked girl. It's a little kink of mine. Do you know
what a kink is, sweetie?"<br> <br> Lia just shook her head.<br> <br> "How old are you? Martha asked.<br> <br> "15…um…I'm 15."<br> <br> "Oh my, forbidden fruit. Still a virgin?"<br> <br> Lia nodded yes.<br> <br>
"Well don't worry, my little cutie; no one here will be taking that
from you. We just like to watch, and you like to be watched." She
turned to Gary and mouthed the word 15 to him. He just nodded that he
understood.<br> <br> "Sometimes, I like to take my Gary to strip clubs and watch naked girls dance for him. Do you want to know why?"<br> <br> Lia just looked at Martha, her chest rising and falling still.<br> <br>
"Because after we get home, he ravages me all night long. But they
aren't like you; they aren’t nearly as cute as you, and they certainly
aren't as innocent either. Gary and I are going right back to our room
after this; he is going to split me in half tonight. I may never walk
right again, all because of you, sweetie. This situation is a dream
come true for us. You are a bit on the young side, though, but we won't
tell if you won't." Martha winked.<br> <br> Lia was looking back and forth between Gary and the three others.<br> <br>
"You don't have to worry about them, sweetie; they know about our kink.
Just look at my Gary and me; you're perfectly safe with us."<br> <br> Lia's chair was beginning to get very wet. Through all of this, she had kept her legs well spread.<br> <br> "I think you're enjoying this as much as we are." Martha whispered to Lia.<br> <br> Lia looked and shook her head, but she couldn't say the words.<br> <br> "Shhh, it's ok; it's ok to enjoy it. Listen to your body; it knows what you want. Rub your thighs for me, sweetie."<br> <br> Lia looked around the room; they seemed to be alone in this section.<br> <br> "It's ok; it's just us here. Go on, rub your thighs for me."<br> <br>
Lia was well past the point of rational thought again. The only thing
that made sense to her at this moment was Martha's instructions. She
brought up her hands and began to rub her inner thighs, feeling just
how wet they had become.<br> <br> "Good girl, just rub them slowly; they need your attention. Just keep rubbing and looking at Gary."<br> <br> Lia looked back and forth from Gary to Martha, all while rubbing her thighs, not realizing where Matthias was taking this.<br> <br>
"Good, Lia. Now take your left hand and rub just under your breast.
Don't touch your nipple just yet. Good girl, just like that."<br> <br>
With her right hand, Lia was rubbing her thighs, and with her left,
just under her breast. She kept this up for minutes; the embarrassment
of the situation was just too much, and she had to close her eyes to
continue.<br> <br> "No, no, sweetie, keep those eyes open. I want you to look at Gary and myself. Only us, no one else."<br> <br> Lia had given up all control; she obeyed and opened her eyes to look at Gary, then Martha, then back to Gary.<br> <br>
"That's it; it's Lia, just Gary and me. We're here for you; we
understand you and what you need. Now move a little higher with your
hands; no nipple yet."<br> <br> Lia was now rubbing her breasts full
on, but as Martha instructed, she was avoiding her nipple. Her right
hand was rubbing the part of her thigh that almost met with her wet
pussy. He was screaming at her to move higher, to finish herself, and
now. To hell with who was around. She needed it more than she ever had
in her life. But she could still Martha didn't give her permission just
yet. Her body wanted to listen to Martha.<br> <br> "Just keep rubbing, baby girl, just like that, nice and slow. Gary and I love when you go slow,."<br> <br> Lia kept rubbing, and her desperation was reaching a peak. She was now softly moaning with every breath.<br> <br> "Shhh, you're doing so well, sweetie, just like I told you. "What a good girl you are."<br> <br>
Lia kept rubbing; in this moment, she wanted nothing more than to
please this young woman; her mind was putty in her hands. But she
managed to break through just slightly to beg one word through her soft
little moans.<br> <br> "Uhh…please…"<br> <br> "You've been such a good girl for my Gary and me. It's time, sweetie, to give us a nice big cum."<br> <br>
In unison, Lia's hands finally made contact with her little clit and
nipple. She barely had time to process how quick it came. Her back
arched, the air from her lungs had been sucked out, her toes curled,
and her open mouth formed an O. No sound came out; Lia's entire body
was spasming. She shook and shook; the oragasmic wave was intense and
unrelenting. Once again, she couldn't breathe as pleasure wracked her
body.<br> <br> Finally, after an eternity in bliss, Lia's senses began
to return one by one. But now the moans kicked in, and she couldn't
stop them. They were low, unlike the time in her room when her parents
heard; these were softer.<br> <br> "Can you give us one more, sweetie?"<br> <br>
Lia nodded, keeping her eyes open as she looked from Gary to Martha,
and began to rub her clit intensely. Pinching her nipple as hard as she
could, Lia wanted nothing more than to give Martha and Gary what they
wanted—another big cum from their good girl.<br> <br> It took longer
the second time, but her second orgasm was nearly as big as the first.
Finally, Lia descended back to Earth. The rational parts of her brain
returned. Embarrassment set in again.<br> <br> "Oh my God, I… I can't believe I… I'm so…."<br> <br>
"Stop them right there, Lia. Don't apologize; never apologize for your
body's desires. You just shared something special with us, and we'll
never forget this."<br> <br> <br> Lia was starting to feel a little
better about what just happened. She gave into her body, and it was
okay. Martha even called it a gift.<br> <br> Martha helped Lia stand and clean up her chair. When Lia went to wipe her pussy and legs, Martha stopped her.<br> <br>
"Your brother said that when you were finished meeting him in the hall,
he said you could use his towel to clean up. If you'll excuse us, I'm
going to get drilled silly by my boyfriend now."<br> <br> Lia and the group parted ways, and she walked back through the restaurant to the entrance, turning heads the whole way.<br> <br> When she got to Trevor, who was waiting outside, he was holding out the towel.<br> <br> "I caught your performance; you're such a good girl, Lia."<br> <br>
Lia said nothing and snatched the towel away from him. She cleaned up
herself and was about to wrap the towel around herself, but Trevor
extended his hand expectantly.<br> <br> Lia just tossed the towel back at him, the only thing she could cover, and stood naked, waiting for him to say something.<br> <br> "Now we have a convention to get to."<br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Lia's new reality</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> <br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Part 6</span><br> <br>
Lia was standing in a large hallway in a busy hotel, completely naked.
Having just thrown the towel back at her brother, the only thing close
that she could cover herself with Having just masturbated in a
restaurant for a group of complete strangers, her strength was just now
returning to her legs.<br> <br> "Did you have fun?" Trevor asked her.<br> <br>
Lia just glared back at him. She couldn't understand why her body got
so worked up whenever someone, basically anyone, saw her naked, but she
knew she didn't have fun. Or at least she thought she wasn't having
fun. Once she hit a certain level of arousal, it was like she became a
different person; she would just give in to whatever urges her body
wanted.<br> <br> And now she had to endure the smug look on her
brother's face. After what she just did in the restaurant, there was no
way she was going to be able to convince him that she didn't enjoy her
nudity. She was completely at his mercy; he had complete control over
her modesty, and he decided that she didn't need any at the moment.
There was no way around it; she would have to just have to be naked for
the night and hope her parents would rescue her when they found out
what Trevor was making her do.<br> <br> "Let's just get this over with." Lia demanded. "Where is this thing happening anyway?"<br> <br> "It's the large room around the corner; down the hall, let's go."<br> <br>
Trevor and Lia turned from the smaller hall leading to the restaurant
to the larger main hall that held the convention room entrances. As the
two teens entered the main hall, Lia immediately began to turn heads.
There was a mixture of wolf whistles and catcalls. Lia just held her
head high and walked as proudly as she could, her hands swinging at her
sides.<br> <br> The double doors were propped open, with a sign showing
that this was the location of the convention. Lia’s heat began to do
flips once she saw it. There was a fair amount of foot traffic just
outside of the doors. The mixture of men and women had spotted Lia
coming and simply had smiles on their faces. Not one of them seemed
like they were going to stop her.<br> <br> Trevor stopped and turned
back to Lia. “Ready for this?” not giving her an opportunity to
respond. “Just remember to stick to your story; you are making a
statement by showing up naked.” Trevor just threw the towel he had been
carrying aside to the floor. “Someone will pick it up; besides, it's
not like I can use it now that it has your juices on it.” He was
clearly enjoying teasing Lia.<br> <br> “You are still wearing swim trunks. Won’t that be weird?” Lia shot back.<br> <br> "Yeah, but next to you, no one is going to notice.”<br> <br>
They resumed walking. Lia was determined to make it through this
ordeal: “I just have to hold on long enough; Mom and Dad will see what
Trevor is making me do, and maybe they will finally put an end to
this.” Lia thought to herself.<br> <br> They made their way past the small group at the entrance. Lia was hoping they would stop her from entering, but they didn’t.<br> <br> "Welcome, young lady!”<br> <br> “Glad you could make it.”<br> <br> “...so brave.”<br> <br>
She only heard positive things from this group of adults as they made
their way past and into the main convention hall. “Devon,” she thought.
He must have told people about a certain young, naked girl who planned
on attending naked. He did tell her that he was one of the organizers.
He was so excited to have met her; he must have made sure she wouldn’t
be thrown out.<br> <br> Lia and Trevor stopped after just a few feet
inside, taking in the sight of the large hall. There were several
booths lined along the walls, and two rows of them went down the middle
of the room, ending in a somewhat large standing area and a stage at
the back of the room.<br> <br> One by one, each person that had been
near the entrance of the convention hall noticed Lia, and turned to
watch what the girl would do next. Lia just stood and looked at all
their faces. Her chest was heaving with her heaving breathing. Her
little pink nipples were pointing straight out at them. Standing with
her feet slightly apart, her pussy lips were parted, and her little
clit was poking from its hood. She was strangely thankful for the
masturbation session she had in the restaurant now; she was still
getting turned on again, but she was able to have it at a manageable
level now. She was not yet leaking all over her thighs, but she knew
that wouldn’t last forever.<br> <br> “Ah, you made it!” Devon spotted
them and was heading over. "I would not have blamed you if you had a
change of heart and not showed up at all, but it appears that I’ll need
to ask for forgiveness for underestimating you.” Reaching the two
teens, Devon shook both their hands.<br> <br> “I almost did, sir. As
you can imagine, I’m still very nervous about being here like this.”
Lia answered back. She was surprised at her own words. She was barely
able to speak in the elevator, but now she was taking the lead in this,
even over Trevor. Lia had quickly decided that the best way to get
through this was to take Trevor’s advice and play the part of a
political girl making a statement.<br> <br> "Well, I’m very glad you did! You are going to set a fine example for the other younger members here.” Devon said. <br> <br>
“What others?” Lia asked, a little nervous to hear this after Trevor
had said that there was a Libertarian club at their school.<br> <br> “They are about your age, I believe. They have a club at their high school a few hours away.”<br> <br>
Lia’s heart sank; knowing her luck, she was bound to run into someone
she actually knew. Then there wouldn't be any escaping the talk once
school started again. Everyone would think that she likes to walk
around naked.<br> <br> "Well, I won’t keep you two; I’m sure you’ll
want to make your rounds. If anyone bothers you in any way, Lia, simply
let me know and I’ll take care of it. I have informed the other
organizers about you being here, and we are all in agreement. You have
the right to attend in any dress, or lack of it, you choose to.” Devon
took his leave after that.<br> <br> Trevor placed a hand on Lia’s shoulder. “That was great, sis! See? You can handle this; come on, let's walk around some.”<br> <br>
Lia and Trevor started off through the room; they made their way along
the outer walls and booths. For Lia, it was a surreal feeling to be
walking naked among so many clothed people. She was trying to act as
though she wasn’t completely embarrassed about it. She suppressed all
urges to cover herself and just kept moving. The feeling of carpet on
her bare feet was a constant reminder of her state. It kept her arousal
levels up, though thankfully not to the level where people could see
the evidence of this on her thighs. But her clit was still poking out,
maybe even more than when she first entered the room. She was certain
that a few people were able to spot it. But even if they weren’t, they
could all still see her shaved pussy.<br> <br> Not everyone was as
thrilled to see a naked Lia, as Devon was. Waking deep into the
convention hall, she was starting to draw some disgusted looks too.
Mostly middle-aged women with their smiling husbands But still, no one
made an attempt to stop her or tell her to put something on. She tried
to smile when she could manage it, but she mostly kept a neutral look
on her face, as if she were still wearing something.<br> <br> They were
coming up on the entrance doors again, but this time from the other
side, as they had made their way around the entire room. Lia was hoping
that Trevor would get bored of being there and want to leave. She had
done more than she ever thought possible. She has walked through a
crowded convention hall entirely naked. She was about to ask Trevor if
they could leave; at least if they did actually go swimming, she could
hide under the water. Just as she was about to ask, she was stopped
cold by what she saw about twenty feet ahead of them. There were kids
from her school at a booth near the entrance. Their booth was slightly
obscured from the doors, so she didn’t notice them at first, and they
haven't yet noticed her.<br> <br> “Trevor, wait!” Lia grabbed his arm
and pulled him to a stop. “I recognize them! At the booth up on the
left! They go to our school! They can’t see me like this!”<br> <br>
Tevor looked at the booth, then back at Lia. "Well, they are going to
see you eventually; we have to pass by them if you want to leave.”<br> <br> “Pleeese! Can we just go back around the way we came? I’ve done everything you asked for so far, haven’t I?”<br> <br>
Trevor looked Lia up and down. He was a half-second from taking pity on
his naked sister. She had managed to endure everything he put her
through so far but then he noticed her nipples were still rock hard,
and her bare pussy still showed signs of arousal. Even after that huge
orgasm she had in the restaurant, she was revving back up. He decided
to keep pushing her.<br> <br> “I’ll make you a deal; if you talk to them for just a few minutes, then we can leave.”<br> <br>
Lia looked over at the booth again. There were three of them: two boys
and a girl. Zack, Leon, and Claire She didn’t know them well; they were
a year ahead of her, and they would be juniors when the school year
started again. But still, Lia was sure they would know who she was. If
she went to talk to them, then there would be no way they wouldn’t say
anything about it, and then it would be all over school how she walks
in crowded areas naked. By some miracle, her dancing topless at the
frat party had not gotten out, but she would have rather dealt with her
school knowing that than what was about to happen.<br> <br> Lia didn’t
let herself think about it anymore; if this was going to happen, then
it was best that she just jumped right in. Lia took a deep breath and
strode off to the booth where her schoolmates were sitting.<br> <br>
Trevor, being impressed by his sister’s resolve, was about to follow
her when he got a phone call from his mom. He decided to take the call
past the booth near the entrance of the convention hall; he figured Lia
would be able to handle herself on her own for now.<br> <br> Lia, not
realizing Trevor was no longer with her, walked as confidently as she
could. Leon spotted her first, aggressively tapping Zack on the
shoulder to get his attention, causing him to drop his drink. When he
finally did notice Lia, neither boy seemed to care about the split
drink; they both just stared slack-jawed at the naked beauty
approaching. Lia stood in front of the booth; she stood far enough away
that none of her body was hidden.<br> <br> The boys continued to stare in disbelief, but now Claire had finally noticed her.<br> <br> “Lia? Is that you? What the hell are you doing here?<br> <br>
“Oh hi, Claire, I just thought I’d come by and check things out.”
Turning to the boys “You are Leon and Zack, right? I’ve seen you guys
around school.”<br> <br> Both boys could barely utter responses. They
were in awe of the sight before them. Lia was sure by the looks on
their faces that she might have been the first naked girl they had ever
seen. This level of embarrassment was new for Lia; besides Stacy and
Kyle, these were the first kids around her age, and she knew seeing her
completely naked. She couldn’t help thinking about the fact that she
would have to see them again when school started, and they would
forever know what she looked like naked. This thought had caused her
arousal to kick up in a big way; she could feel the wetness between her
legs returning. Lia began to wonder if it was possible for a girl to
dehydrate by losing so much moisture through her vagina.<br> <br> Here
it was—the very thing Lia was afraid of. Other kids from school saw her
naked. This wasn’t the first time people she knew from school—Kyle and
Stacy had both seen her—but after they were hauled off by the cops, she
wasn’t as worried about them. These three were wildcards. Lia could
feel the six eyes on her body, traveling up and down. She could feel
their eyes watching her tits rise and fall with every breath she took.
Then she could feel the eyes wander down to her shaved pussy, looking
at how red and puffy it was due to her growing arousal. She had to let
them look; she had to fight the urge to cover and keep her arms at her
sides.<br> <br> "Lia, why are you naked? You do realize you’re naked, right?” Claire asked.<br> <br>
“Well…” Lia went into explaining what Trevor had coached her. In an
effort to protest their school's dress code for girls and to make a
statement about the standards of dress for women in general, she
decided to come to the event without anything on. Even as Lia was
laying it all out, she was worried that they wouldn’t believe her; she
didn’t believe what she was saying, and she didn’t think anyone else
would either. But exactly as Trevor had predicted, Lia was not
challenged on any of it.<br> <br> “I didn’t think our dress code was
all that unfair to us, but you certainly are making your point known,
or, I should say, points.” Claire answered back, clearly meaning Lia’s
nipples.<br> <br> Lia blushed at this.<br> <br> "Sorry, Lia, I make
jokes to break tension. I think it's really brave of you; it takes a
lot of guts to do what you’re doing.” Claire said.<br> <br> Claire was
cute; she was not as good-looking as Lia, but she was definitely a
looker in her own right. She had a slightly mousy face and glasses with
big lenses, brown eyes, brown hair, and small button noises. She was
several inches taller than Lia, with bigger breasts, around a C cup.<br> <br>
“It's alright; as you can imagine, I’m very nervous about being here
like this, but this issue is important to me, and I wanted people to
notice.”<br> <br> "Well, we definitely noticed.” Zack finally found his
voice. “I thought Clarie here was the most political girl I knew, but
clearly that's changed now.<br> <br> Clarie shot a side glance at Zack,
bothered by the remark that she was not the most political girl there.
She was already starting to feel a little jealous of the attention Lia
was getting.<br> <br> “So what are you guys doing here? Is this for school or something?” Lia asked.<br> <br>
“Yeah, we are just advertising our club; you should join! It's just the
three of us.” Leon chimed in. “We could use another girl to balance
things out.”<br> <br> Clarie has now shot him a look too. Before this
moment, she had been the center of attention in the group. She started
the club her freshman year and suspected at times that the only reason
Zack and Leon agreed to join was because they might be into her. She
was used to both of them hanging on her every word, but now one naked
girl comes along, and it's like she's not even there anymore. She was
jealous now but still admired Lia’s conviction, so she couldn’t be
upset at her, but she could be upset at the mindlessness of teenage
boys.<br> <br> "Um, maybe I’m not really into clubs." Lia was noticing
that the two boys were just running their eyes up and down her body
still. “Can I ask you guys a favor? Could you not mention this to
anyone from school? I don’t think they would understand what I’m trying
to do here.”<br> <br> The group agreed to keep Lia’s naked attendance
to themselves. They were a nice group, and soon the conversation turned
from Lia’s nakedness to mundane school activities and other teenage
topics. Lia was becoming more comfortable being naked in front of them,
even though the boys were still stealing glances at her naked breasts
and bald pussy.<br> <br> <br> Trevor was watching this unfold from the
entrance doors; he was waiting for their parents to arrive. They had
cut their date short and made it back to the room when they called
Trevor to find out where he and Lia went. Trevor asked them to meet him
there. He wanted them to see firsthand their daughter attending such a
public event completely naked.<br> <br> When they arrived shortly after
the call, they were both shocked to see that Lia was naked, and Trevor
was surprised by this reaction.<br> <br> “You brought her down here like that!" Steve exclaimed with a bit of anger behind his voice.<br> <br>
The family could see Lia standing at the booth, naked, talking to the
other students. But Lia was so involved with her conversation that she
hadn't noticed them.<br> <br> “Why are you guys upset? You told her yourself, mom, that she would have to be naked out of the house.” Trevor replied.<br> <br>
"Yes, but I mostly told her that to scare her; I never intended to go
this far with it!” Diana argued. “That deal with Mike yesterday was as
far as we were going to go.”<br> <br> “What about letting her spend the day with Carol, mom? Who knows what that girl is already planning?”<br> <br>
“I suggested that, in the heat of my anger, Lisa’s family are big
campaign contributors. I was just upset that Lia put that at risk, but
she didn’t know that; it wasn’t fair to hold that against her. I was
planning on calling Lisa tomorrow to call it off and arrange something
else for Lia to do to make it right.”<br> <br> “So what was your plan
for the rest of Lia’s punishment then? Just keep naked at home? Maybe
embarrass her in front of a guest. That won’t be good enough for her.
If we don’t expose her more, then she’ll revert back to her bad
behavior.”<br> <br> Steve watched his son with intense interest,
clearly thinking of something, but Trevor couldn’t figure out what it
might be. But Diana was more vocal.<br> <br> “What are you talking about, Trevor?”<br> <br>
Trevor had formed a theory about Lia—that she was definitely an
exhibionist, but one that couldn’t accept it—that denial would confuse
her feelings on the matter and cause her to behave in ways that would
get her attention. Like seeking out the approval of two popular high
school students, allowing herself to be talked into sneaking out to
parties, and dancing topless for college boys. But now that she was
under her current punishment, that type of behavior mostly went away.
Lia would make mistakes, like what happened with Carol, but Trevor
figured that was probably due to Lia becoming comfortable with her
situation. After a couple of weeks, being naked at home would be
easier, that it wouldn't satisfy her body’s urge to be shown off or
seen. So she acted out again to gain that attention back. Trevor
explained this theory to his parents. Steve continued to watch Trevor,
but still had the look of compilation on his face.<br> <br> Trevor reminded his mom that she was the main enforcer of Lia’s punishment so far.<br> <br>
“You can’t make empty threats to Lia; she’ll figure out the boundaries
eventually and find a way around them. You should keep her day with
Carol; it will have the benefit of serving as a punishment for what she
did to her and helping satisfy her exhibitionist needs.”<br> <br> “You really think Lia is an exhibitionist?" Diana asked.<br> <br>
Trevor went on to explain what he suspected he walked in on yesterday
with Gil and Lia in the living room and what he saw when Gil was
putting sunscreen on her. He even included how she reacted after the
walk through the lobby and what happened in the restaurant; he
conveniently left out the part where he basically set Lia up for her
performance, but she still did it; she didn’t put up THAT much of a
fight to any of the night's events so far. “The more we expose Lia, the
better for her it will be; she has already improved a lot. The last two
weeks of school, she wasn’t hanging around Kyle and Stacy. And just
look at her now; she might actually be making new friends over there.”<br> <br>
Lia, who still hadn’t noticed her parents, did seem to be having a good
time talking to the other kids; she was even smiling. The two boys were
hanging on every word of hers, but that wasn’t all that surprising.<br> <br> Finally, Steve spoke up. “I think Trevor is right.”<br> <br>
“Steve? Are you serious? I’ve had to drag you along at every step so
far with this punishment. You asked me twice already to take back the
leg spreading and masturbation.”<br> <br> “This has not been an easy
thing for me to deal with, but Trevor has been making good points. I
also noticed how she was with Gil putting sunscreen on her. She does
seem to have these tendencies.”<br> <br> “Steve, I…”<br> <br> “Diana,
seeing Lia in that ambulance was the most scared I had been in my life.
Trevor is right; if we don’t control this with our daughter, she could
get herself hurt. What if the police had arrived at the party just ten
minutes later? What would have happened to her? Lia is a lot like your
sister. Your parents took the opposite approach with her; look how that
turned out.”<br> <br> “Wait, Aunt Laurel was like this?” Trevor asked.<br> <br>
“Nevermind about that.” Diana shot the question down. "Okay, Steve, but
if we are going to commit to this, then you have to participate as
well; no more letting me and your sons do all the work with Lia. You’ve
always been soft on your little princess, and she knows it.”<br> <br>
“I’ll commit; we’ll keep her naked through tomorrow and on the ride
home. If we make any stops, she won’t be allowed to just stay in the
car. And she’ll spend that day with Carol; we’ll trust Lisa to not let
Carol get out of control.”<br> <br> “We actually do need to stop and pick up a present for Gil; his birthday party is coming up.”<br> <br> “I have an idea for a second present; we could get Gil." Trevor said.<br> <br> <br> <br>
Lia was just beginning to get a little more comfortable, she had
managed to turn the conversation from her nudity to other topics, but
that didn’t last; the boys were just too interested in their
schoolmate’s nudity.<br> <br> “I can’t get over how much guts it takes for you to be here naked, Lia, and you look beautiful too.” Zack said. <br> <br> "Yeah, I agree, Lia; you shouldn’t be embarrassed; you really are beautiful.” Leon chimed in.<br> <br>
Lia could hardly process this feeling. Having the boys bring her nudity
back to the center of attention did basically destroy the small level
of comfort she had started to feel, but hearing the boys give her
compliments instead of laughing made her feel really good about her
body. If she had to be naked, at least it was nice to hear that she
looked good while being unclothed. Their words also had another effect
on her body, between her legs.<br> <br> “Thank you guys. I am still very nervous, but it's nice to hear.”<br> <br>
Lia was hoping that with the conversation back on her body, her growing
arousal wouldn’t become more noticeable. The boys probably weren’t the
problem; Lia has a strong suspicion that they didn’t see many naked
girls and would not pick up on the signs. But Claire might be able to,
no doubt having felt the same feelings Lia had at some level.<br> <br>
But Claire wasn’t noticing Lia’s body in the same way; Claire was
struggling with the fact that she was no longer the center of these
boys' attention. She wasn’t a vain girl, and even though she was very
cute and had features that any teen boy would gawk at, but due to her
excessive nerdiness and unnatural love of politics for a 16-year-old
girl, she wasn’t very popular with boys at her school. Being in this
small, three-person club had finally given her a taste of being popular
with boys, Zack and Leon. She had been the leader of this group, mostly
due to being an attractive girl, but now she was losing them. Her heart
had sunk when Lia was asked to join their club; there wouldn’t be any
way she would be able to compete with her, especially if she was prone
to taking her clothes off. Claire had to get them back, and there was
only one idea that came to mind.<br> <br> “I’ve been thinking about
what you're doing here tonight, Lia, and your reasons, and well... I
support them 100%. In fact, I think I’ll join you if you don’t mind.”<br> <br>
Lia stared wide-eyed at Claire. This girl was offering to willingly
take off her clothes because she was inspired by her own nudity!<br> <br> The two boys finally turned their attention back to Claire, in utter disbelief at what she was suggesting.<br> <br>
"Um, are you sure? This isn’t as easy as it seems, you know.” Lia was
starting to panic a little. She couldn’t let this girl strip off her
clothes, but she couldn’t come right out and admit what was really
going on.<br> <br> “My heart is pounding, but I’m sure. You have
inspired me, and I think what you are doing is important for women.”
Claire was lying; she didn’t have any strong feelings about her
school's dress codes or societal dress expectations, for that matter.
But what she did believe was that she needed to keep the boy’s
attention. She had tasted a small amount of popularity, and she wanted
to keep it. “Could you two stand and shield me while I undress? Face
away, please.”<br> <br> The boys didn’t need to be asked twice. They
quickly stood together, facing outwards, towards Lia and the rest of
the convention.<br> <br> Claire figured the best way to do this was to
quickly rip the bandage off. She didn’t know Lia well, but Lia had a
reputation at school for being a follower, Kyle and Stacy’s little
shadow, and a lost puppy. If Lia could muster the courage to take a
stand on something, then she could too. Claire started with her blouse,
then her pants; without thinking, she continued with her bra and
finally her panties. She was now as naked as Lia. With her heart
beating out of her chest, she turned to face the boys’s backs and the
convention. "Ok, you can turn around now."<br> <br> The boys parted
from one another, turning towards Claire. They couldn’t believe their
luck. First they got to see Lia naked, and now Claire too.<br> <br>
Claire’s breasts were larger than Lia's; they didn’t hold themselves up
quite as well as Lia's, but they still held themselves up. She had
larger areolas, about the size of a silver dollar, with pink upturned
nipples. Claire was in great shape as well, with a flat stomach and
wide hips. The boy’s vision had traveled down from her amazing breasts
to what was the main show—her pussy. She had a light tuft of public
hair above her lips, which had smaller, sparse brown hairs on them.
Claire didn’t shave, but it was clear she kept herself trim down south;
everything was visible.<br> <br> Claire’s impressive chest was heaving
up and down, not due to arousal, like Lia’s often did, but nerves. The
boys were staring at her like she had never seen before. Their booth
was also starting to attract more looks from other convention goers.
First there was one naked girl; now there were two of them. Some of the
older members were starting to get concerned that this was turning into
something else. There would later be many complaints made to Devon, one
of the organizers, mostly by older women, but these would fall on deaf
ears.<br> <br> The look of Clarie was stunning to Lia. She seemed so
vulnerable and exposed. Seeing Claire like that was causing Lia’s
arousal to spike again. It wasn’t because she was into girls; no, it
had to be the fact that Claire’s nudity reminded Lia of what she looked
like most of the time now: a naked, vulnerable teen at the mercy of
everyone's eyes, and there was nothing she could do about it.<br> <br>
"Ok, guys, I might be naked now, but that doesn’t mean you can just sit
there and stare at me.” Claire was a bundle of nerves, but she was
enjoying the attention far more than she had expected when she first
thought of this crazy idea. Maybe she should do a meeting or two like
this. “No way,” she thought to herself. This one time was enough.<br> <br>
Claire set her clothes on the edge of the table. She made sure to hide
her panties in her pants because, for some reason, even though she was
now naked, she was concerned about the boys seeing her panties on the
table.<br> <br> "Why, hello there, Claire! I see my sister's bold
statement is rubbing off on you!” Trevor made his entrance to the
group, having parted with his parents, who went back to the room.<br> <br>
“Trevor! Wha…what are you doing here!?” Claire had jumped in surprise,
knocking herself into the table. Like all the other girls in her
school, she knew of Trevor well and had a huge crush on him. He was the
cutest boy in school and had brains too, something Claire had found
most attractive about him. She was so upset that he had graduated and
wouldn’t be at school anymore, but now here he was, seeing her
completely naked! Claire quickly covered herself, one arm covering her
breasts and the other covering her pussy.<br> <br> It never crossed her
mind to grab her clothes and try to get dressed again. It was a huge
mistake on her part, not thinking of her clothes. If she had, she might
have noticed that when she bumped the table, all of her clothes fell
off the edge and into a trash can sitting right near the table.
Unfortunately for Claire, there was too much female nudity for the boys
to notice either. But that wasn’t the most tragic part; the most tragic
part was the nearby janitor. He was looking for any reason to somehow
get a closer look at the girls and had decided to empty the trash can,
even though it didn’t really need it. However, he also failed to notice
the clothes that had fallen in. He was too busy trying to get a look at
the girls; one was covering herself now, but he could still see her
perfect, apple-shaped ass, but the other girl wasn’t covering at all,
and he got a great look at her.<br> <br> The janitor couldn’t justify
staying too long; he emptied the can into his mobile cart and
reluctantly moved on, taking all of Claire’s clothes, as well as her
room key, with him.<br> <br> <br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Lia’s new reality</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> <br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Part 7</span><br> <br>
Claire was panicking now. She was already a bundle of nerves when she
first took off her clothes, fighting every urge to cover herself in the
process, but she was desperate. She had succeeded, at least she
thought, in regaining the admiration of the two boys in her little club.<br> <br>
The sad truth was that she never lost it to begin with. Sure, the boys
had their eyes glued to Lia’s naked body, but when she eventually left,
they would have been back to trying to impress Claire.<br> <br> But
Claire would never realize this, and now she was just as naked as Lia
was, and after seeing Trevor show up, she completely lost her nerve for
it.<br> <br> “Trevor! Wha… What are you doing here!?”<br> <br> “I’m
just here to support my sister and to keep an eye on her, of course.
It's not exactly safe for a naked girl to be wandering around by
herself.”<br> <br> Claire, now attempting to cover her breasts and
pussy, just stared at him in desperation. Her little outburst of
embarrassment was starting to turn some heads among the other
attendees. Now there were two naked girls, and one of them appeared to
be in some level of distress. Lia was still standing, uncovered.<br> <br> “So why don’t you guys tell me what's going on here?” Trevor asked.<br> <br>
Claire and the boys were frozen; they all felt as though they might be
doing something wrong. Lia, knowing almost exactly what Claire was
going through, decided to take the lead. She explained to Trevor how
Claire was inspired by her and wanted to take part in being naked to
show support.<br> <br> Lia was feeling incredibly guilty about it. She knew that the only reason Claire was naked was because of her.<br> <br>
Trevor was truly enjoying himself now; he wanted to feel bad for
Claire, who was clearly extremely embarrassed to be naked. Probably
more so than Lia ever was, the odds of her being an exhibitionist like
his sister were low, but Claire had willingly stripped, so he didn’t
feel too bad for her. He couldn’t deny that his sister looked amazing
naked, but she was still his sister and he wasn't sexually attracted to
her. But Claire, on the other hand, was not related to him; he felt
that ogling her was completely fine. She didn’t quite have the body
that Lia did, but her tits were bigger, and even with her covering them
and her pussy, the sight was incredibly hot.<br> <br> “Well Claire I have to say, I’m proud of you both.” Trevor smiled at her.<br> <br>
Claire felt a flutter in her chest at this compliment; even being more
embarrassed than she ever had been in her life, she almost beamed at
his attention.<br> <br> "Thanks, but I think I’m done being brave; I’m going to get dressed now.”<br> <br>
Claire turned to retrieve her clothes, but obviously they were not
where she left them. Frantically, Claire began to search all around the
table; she had been the closest to her clothes, so she knew that none
of the boys had hid them. There wasn't anywhere they could be; there
was nothing around the table for them to hide behind except an empty
trashcan. In her panicked search, Claire had stopped trying to cover
herself, once again putting all her naked charms on display. Trevor and
Lia simply watched, and her large breasts swayed and bounced as she
looked all around the table. Zack and Leon were trying to help as best
they could, but they were very distracted by all the naked girl flesh
and were barely looking.<br> <br> When it became clear that her clothes
were gone, Claire resumed trying to cover her breasts and pussy. She
began to hyperventilate, saying over and over, “They're gone!” Zack and
Leon tried to calm her down, saying that they would take her back to
her room to get dressed in whatever clothes she bought for the next
day. Claire, being only 16, was not at the hotel alone; her parents had
driven her and her friends, the boys had their own room and Claire was
with her parents. Her parents would be out still; she could get back to
the room before they got back to get dressed, but of course she
couldn’t without her key.<br> <br> “My room key was in my pants pocket! I’m stuck out here like this!”<br> <br>
Zack had suggested finding her parents, who were somewhere in the
hotel, for their key. Claire, not wanting to find them herself, had
reasoned that if one of her friends had asked for a room key, then they
would think something was wrong and come find her. Her parents would
not be happy at all to find her in her nude state; what parent would?
No, if Claire had any hope of getting back to her room before her
parents did, she would need another key from the front desk. But she
had no idea how to get one in her current state.<br> <br> Zack and Leon
offered to help in whatever way they could. Zack would look around the
convention to see if somehow he could find her clothes, and Leon would
go to the front desk to get a replacement key. The boys were staying in
their own room nearby, and it never crossed any of their minds to offer
Claire to hide in there or offer her anything from their own suitcases
to wear. None of the teens were thinking straight at this moment.<br> <br> “You can’t leave me here alone!” Claire said.<br> <br>
“Why don’t you come with us?” Trevor offered. “Lia and I were just
about to leave; we were going to the swimming pool. It's an inside one,
and there probably won’t be a lot of people there.”<br> <br> Claire bit
her lip while she thought that, even though she thought Trevor was
incredibly cute and was very attracted to him, she hardly knew either
Trevor or Lia. She decided that being with another naked girl was
better than being alone, and she agreed. The boys would meet her there
if they managed to find her clothes or get her a new key.<br> <br>
Before Leon turned to leave, he had one suggestion for his naked
friend. "Um, Claire, I don’t want this to sound bad or anything, but
since you are going with them," He motioned towards Lia and Trevor.
"Then you should probably act more like Lia.”<br> <br> Claire looked at him puzzled.<br> <br>
“It's probably best that you don’t cover yourself; otherwise, people
will think that there is something wrong and try to help, which could
complicate things; they might even try to find your parents. Lia has
been walking around naked for a while now, and no one has messed with
her. Try to act more like her.”<br> <br> Claire, realizing he was
right, attempted to drop her arms again. She only managed to muster the
courage again after looking at Lia standing a few feet away with her
arms at her sides, still drawing many looks from those around her.
Claire too let her arms hang at her sides again, giving Leon a close
look at her naked body. He and Claire exchanged a small smile, and he
ran off out of the convention hall and towards the front desk.<br> <br>
Trevor, Lia, and Claire started off towards the swimming pool, finally
leaving the convention hall. From the moment Lia arrived, all she
wanted to do was leave and go back to her room, but now that Claire was
also naked, she felt like she needed to stay with her. She could see
that Claire was having a much harder time than she was with nudity. She
was more used to nudity than Claire, but she still thought that she
handled it better, even when it first started. Claire’s first time
naked had been a lot more public than Lia’s, but stripping in the
living room while everyone in her family watched wasn’t easy either.
Lia began to seriously wonder if her brother had been right about
her—maybe she was an exhibitionist. Lia quickly suppressed this; she
hated being naked in public; it didn’t matter how well she handled the
punishment or how her body reacted.<br> <br> The three teens finally
entered the pool area. It was an indoor setup with an Olympic-size pool
and a large hot tub nearby that could hold 10 people. Trevor was right;
there were not very many people there—one lifeguard on duty and three
others in the pool itself. Lia could see that the three were about her
age, and the lifeguard was maybe in her early 20s.<br> <br> The three
were not noticed, and Claire took the opportunity to quickly run to the
hot tube and get it up to her neck. The jets were already going and
were able to cover the girl.<br> <br> Lia took off after her, thinking
Claire had a great idea. Lia ran to get in, catching the attention of
the lifeguard, who yelled “No running!” as soon as Lia managed to
submerge herself to her neck as well. The three boys in the pool
noticed that there were now teen girls around, but not that they were
naked yet. They were whispering to each other, but none had approached
yet. Probably due to Trevor being there and being much bigger than the
younger boys, he had an intimidating presence. Trevor removed his shirt
and joined them in the tube. Claire kept stealing glances at him.<br> <br>
Lia was finally able to relax now, finally having some level of cover
since she left her room. She and Claire were able to have some small
talk, although Claire was distracted by her situation and kept looking
at the door, hoping that Zack or Leon would walk through any second
with a solution to her problem.<br> <br> The boys in the pool kept
looking over at the girls; they couldn't have known they were naked,
but just the fact that there were some teen girls around had already
started them thinking of ways that they could go over. Even the
lifeguard kept looking over; he didn’t know the girls were naked
either, but he knew something was up with them.<br> <br> Trevor was
staying mostly quiet as Lia and Claire were talking. He was processing
his luck at getting to see another girl naked. Claire was a bit dorky,
but he thought she was cute and had amazing tits. He liked big tits;
Lia’s were quite small; he thought they were cute and perfectly shaped,
even if she was his sister, but he preferred Claire’s impressive rack.<br> <br>
As the conversation went on, Lia’s guilt was increasing, and she could
see that as the minutes ticked away, Claire was getting more and more
restless. Lia was actually starting to like Claire and thought maybe
she could make a friend, a real one, and she knew that if there was any
hope of being friends in the future, then Lia had to come clean about
why she was naked.<br> <br> “Claire… There is something I have to
admit... Um, you are going to be mad, and you have to know before I go
on that I am very sorry and didn’t mean for this to happen this way."<br> <br> Claire just looked at Lia, puzzled.<br> <br>
Lia started at the beginning, talking about how she had been hanging
out with Stacy and Kyle, which of course Claire knew, but also about
how she had been sneaking out at night and the party where she was
busted by the cops. She spilled everything from there—that she wasn’t
naked by choice and her punishment and how it works—finally ending up
where the two naked girls were right now, sitting in a hot tube with no
way of getting dressed. Lia even included the part about her
masturbating in the restaurant; she held nothing back.<br> <br> Claire just sat in stunned silence, processing everything Lia had just told her.<br> <br>
“I’m really, really sorry, Claire! I wanted to stop you from taking
your clothes off, but I didn’t know how. I was too scared to admit my
situation.”<br> <br> Claire finally sat up and began to yell at Lia and
Trevor. “You lied!? This whole time!? I thought you were serious about
your beliefs! I was actually inspired by you! And you let me humiliate
myself in front of Zack, Leon, and everyone else there! I could still
get caught by my parents! They’ll kill me!"<br> <br> Claire was so
distracted by her own anger and shock that she didn’t realize that by
sitting up, her naked breasts were out of the water and fully visible.
The boys in the pool couldn’t see them, but the lifeguard and Trevor
sure could. The lifeguard made no attempt to stop the situation; he was
enjoying the show.<br> <br> Finally, Claire turned her attention to
Trevor. “And you! How could you do this to your own sister!? Taking her
outside naked! And having her do that at a restaurant! Just what the
hell kind of punishment is this!?”<br> <br> Trevor was barely able to
concentrate on her lecture; he was too busy staring at her breasts,
which would bounce and jiggle a bit as she was scolding the two of
them. Finally, Claire was done yelling and just looked at the two of
them.<br> <br> Lia sat in silence, but Trevor just chucked a bit before
responding. "Look, Claire, I get you are upset, and this punishment
seems harsh, but you have no idea what Lia put our parents through.
They were out of options, and believe it or not, Lia’s behavior has
improved a great deal since this started. Besides, I think Lia here
likes it on some level.”<br> <br> Lia just lowered her head and shook it. It was no use arguing with him anymore; he wouldn't change his mind.<br> <br>
Trevor then noticed the three teen boys looking over at them and
talking; they seemed to be able to make a move to come over. Trevor
thought that it might be best to stall them if he could, but Claire
didn’t seem to be in the mood to have to deal with them. She had
lowered herself back down so her breasts were once again covered by the
water and bubbles of the hot tub. “I’m going to go talk to those boys;
see if I can keep them from coming over here till your friends come
back.”<br> <br> Trevor left for the pool. Claire was happy that he left, more because she wanted to keep the boys away for now.<br> <br>
"Look, Claire, I’m really sorry that this happened. I feel terrible.”
Lia kept her head down and couldn’t look at her. A single tear now
streamed down her cheek.<br> <br> Claire could see that Lia really
meant it; her initial anger at learning the truth was starting to calm.
In fact, it was not Claire’s turn to feel a little guilty for just
yelling at Lia; she realized that being naked wasn’t her choice; who
wouldn’t come up with a cover story? She also realized that she lied
about her own stripping, not to show solidarity with Lia but to take
back the attention of her friends that Lia was stealing.<br> <br>
“Listen, Lia, it's okay. I think it’s time that I be honest with you
too. Claire began to explain to Lia that she stripped because she was
jealous of the attention she was getting from her friends.<br> <br> “Oh Claire, I’m sorry, I don't know what to say." Lia finally met Claire’s gaze.<br> <br>
"No, it's fine, really. Of course the boys were going to look, with a
body like yours... Well, I’m not into girls or anything, but you look
amazing naked!”<br> <br> Lia blushed bright red. She wasn’t into girls
either, but this was a genuine compliment about her naked body that
wasn’t motivated by lust. “Ya know, you look really good naked too; I
wish I had breasts like yours.” Lia blushed some more. To actually
compliment another girl about her naked breasts was not something she
thought she would ever do.<br> <br> Claire smiled; she was actually
beginning to like Lia for real now. "So, is your brother right? Do you
actually like being naked in public like this?”<br> <br> “No! I mean, no, I don’t think so. I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the lobby earlier."<br> <br> "Well, what about the restaurant?” Claire asked. “You would have to be pretty worked up to do something like that.”<br> <br>
“I can’t explain why my body reacts like that; it's not like I want it
too; it just happens. It's like another part of me takes over, and I
just give into the situation. I swear, Claire, I’m not an exhibitionist
or anything like that.”<br> <br> “Well, when this ‘other part’ of you takes over, do you feel the same embarrassment then?”<br> <br>
“No, I guess not, at least not while I'm, um, you know, like that.” Lia
was struggling to say that when she was really turned on, her
embarrassment levels were far more manageable. She briefly thought back
to the board game with Gil and how she willingly exposed herself to him.<br> <br>
“Have you thought about just giving into that? It might make it easier
to handle being naked, and if your parents think you like the
punishment, then they might stop.”<br> "Well, I'm hoping that when they
find out Trevor made me come down here like this, they will freak out
and stop anyway.” Lia had no idea that they were won over to Trevor's
side to expose her as much as possible now.<br> <br> “What if they
don’t? You should prepare yourself in case they don’t, for all you
know, your brother already told them what he was doing tonight.”<br> <br>
This idea drained the blush from Lia’s face. Claire could be right, and
her nudity could be very long term. “How could I prepare!? I’ve already
been naked in front of a ton of people now, and it's all been awful!”<br> <br>
"Well, except for the restaurant.” Claire and Lia locked eyes. "Sure,
it was bad at first, but when the ‘other part’ of you took over, you
were not embarrassed, at least according to what you just said, and
don’t feel bad, Lia, but it sounded like you enjoyed the ending of that
too.”<br> <br> Lia just stared at Claire incredulously.<br> <br> “Look,
I’m not agreeing with Treavor or anything; I’m just saying that you
should use every advantage you have to deal with this. Maybe you could
control this ‘other part’ of you, then you could show your parents that
this isn’t much of a punishment, and they’ll probably give your clothes
back.”<br> <br> “I don’t know." Lia was thinking that Claire could be
on to something, but that would mean going further into the abyss to
get herself out, but if it worked, then it would be worth it. “How
would I even do this?”<br> <br> “I’ll help; it's going to mean exposing yourself more, but that's the point.”<br> <br> Lia nodded; she was ready to try, and the intense tingling in her pussy was agreeing. "So, what do I do?”<br> <br>
"Ok, so I’ll tell you to do something; don’t worry, it won’t be too
crazy, and as soon as I say go, I want you to do it. Don’t think about
it; just go. Don’t give yourself a chance to think about it; just let
your body take over. Don’t think about how embarrassed you are; just
move your body. It will probably be really hard, but if we do this
enough, it will get easier."<br> <br> Lia gulped. She was being told that she was about to expose herself again, but this time she wasn’t supposed to think, just do.<br> <br>
Claire was looking around, trying to figure out something minor for Lia
to do compared to what she had already done. Claire found her answer.<br> <br> "Ok, I got it. Before I tell you, just remember, don’t think, just go; maybe focus on how your body is feeling, okay?”<br> <br> Lia nodded, her eyes wide.<br> <br>
“See the cute lifeguard over there? Sitting in the chair? I want you to
get out of the hot tub and walk slowly over to him. Keep your hands
behind your back the whole time. I want you to stand right in front of
him, with your legs at least shoulder-width apart, and ask him if it's
okay that you are here naked. I want you to mention the word naked at
least three times. Let him get a good look, and if we don’t get kicked
out, you can walk slowly back here. Ok go!”<br> <br> Lia, in her best
attempt to follow Claire’s advice, only thought about her instructions
briefly before standing and climbing out of the hot tub. She stood at
the edge proudly; she could feel that the conversation Trevor was
having with the boys had stopped immediately, and all eyes were on her
now, even the lifeguard. Lia put one foot in front of the other and
began her slow walk towards him.<br> <br> The boys were in shock. They
would be entering high school at the end of the summer, and they had
never seen such a beautiful sight. They had all silently agreed that
deciding to swim that evening was the best decision they had made in
their lives. “Calm yourselves, boys; that's my sister; you can look all
you want, but keep your distance for now.” Trevor told them.<br> <br>
Staying true to Claire’s instructions, Lia kept her hand behind her
back and walked slowly towards the lifeguard. She could feel the eyes
of everyone on her body, and she walked. As she got closer with every
agonizing step, Lia was able to see his face more clearly. He had a
blank expression. Realizing this, Lia’s anxiety and heart rate started
to increase; she was becoming more and more scared that she was about
to get yelled at. In any other situation, she would run and hide
herself. Even though Trevor and Claire were close by, she felt alone,
walking away from them and towards this younger man, not knowing how he
would react. Each step felt heavier and heavier.<br> <br> Finally, Lia
stood in front of the young man, still with a black expression. His
eyes were roaming up and down her body, pausing briefly on her bald
pussy, then moving back up. At this point, all Lia could focus on was
how embarrassed she was feeling. This ‘other part’ or her was nowhere
to be found at the moment.<br> <br> “Um…hi sir…um” She was struggling to find any words.<br> <br> The man locked eyes with her for a moment, then a huge smile spread across his face.<br> <br>
Lia was able to breathe a bit easier seeing this; she still had to deal
with her embarrassing instructions, but at least she was not going to
be yelled at or kicked out.<br> <br> "Why, hello there! How are you tonight?”<br> <br>
"I'm good; I just thought my friend and I would go for a swim. I wanted
to ask if it was okay that I’m here naked.” Having to mention the word
‘naked’ three times was not going to be easy; talking about her nudity
out loud caused her incredible embarrassment, and she still had two
more times left.<br> <br> “It's definitely fine with me. What’s the occasion? Are you pledging to a sorority?”<br> <br> "Yes, we are! We were told that we had to come here naked, but that we had to ask for permission.” Two down, one to go.<br> <br> “Oh, is your friend naked too? I thought I noticed something off about her.”<br> <br>
Lia realized she just outed that Claire was naked too. She felt a bit
guilty that she kept doing this to Claire, but consoled herself a bit
with the knowledge that he and the boys were bound to find out
eventually.<br> <br> “I’ve seen a lot of crazy things my freshman year,
but this tops it! You seem kind of young to be in college, though. What
sorority are you joining?”<br> <br> Lia’s panic was back; she had no
idea what to tell him. Not only did she not know any sorority names, he
was beginning to figure out that she wasn’t college age either. But she
had to think of something. She now realized that she hadn't been
standing the way Claire said. Lia squared up to him and placed her feet
apart. His eyes immediately went to her pussy, and she felt the
tingling return. The ‘other part’ was begging to make itself known.<br> <br> “I skipped a grade in high school, and we aren't supposed to say which sorority, sorry.”<br> <br> The lifeguard broke his eyes away from her pussy.<br> <br> “That's alright; I have a pretty good idea which one," he replied.<br> <br>
Lia wanted to wrap up the instructions Claire gave her; she wasn’t
thinking when she asked. “So do you think naked is a good swimsuit for
a girl?”<br> <br> “Are you kidding!? I wish all girls used the swimsuit you are using now."<br> <br>
“Okay, bye!” With her tasks done, Lia wanted to get back to the hot tub
and not get into a huge conversation with this guy. She had to remember
to walk, even though she wanted to run as fast as she could.<br> <br>
Finally making it back to the hot tube, Lia resubmerged herself in the
hot water. Her heart was racing, and the fire in her pussy was burning
hotter than the water in the tub.<br> <br> “Oh my god, Lia! That was great! How do you feel? Is that other part of you coming out?” Claire asked.<br> <br> “I feel ok; I do feel it a little bit; I think it did actually help a bit.”<br> <br>
“Good! Then all we need to do is get you used to it and try to bring it
out more, and once your parents see that you're liking it, they’ll stop
your punishment. Maybe just ground you instead.”<br> <br> Lia shivered
at the thought that she would have to look like she was enjoying her
nudity in front of her parents. But Clarie was right; if they didn’t
stop her punishment after they saw what Trevor was making her do now,
then this would probably be the only way.<br> <br> Cliare was feeling
elated at what she just saw Lia do, and she did all of her instructions
too. She couldn’t deny that it gave her an incredible thrill to tell
Lia to show herself off and then watch her do it. She had to do this
again. But if she was going to get a thrill out of showing Lia off
under the guise of "training,” she felt that she needed to tell her
first.<br> <br> “I have something to admit to you, Lia." Claire
explained the feeling she got watching Lia show herself off and
admitted that it actually turned her on a bit. “I do genuinely want to
help you, but I want you to know that I will really enjoy it as well.”<br> <br>
Hearing this didn’t upset Lia; it seemed everyone wanted to show her
off now, but with Claire, it seemed to come from a good place. But Lia
wanted some proof first.<br> <br> “I think I believe that you actually
want to help me, but I need something from you first. To prove that you
are serious, if you do this, then I’ll agree to let you help train me.
I want you to do what you told me to do. Just so I know that you are
willing to do what you ask me to, even though this might be the only
time you would actually do it.”<br> <br> Claire was thrilled that Lia
was willing; it would only cost her a bit more embarrassment. Trying to
stay true to her instructions, Claire got up and started her walk
toward the lucky lifeguard.<br> <br> Lia was amazed; Claire must have
been serious. She watched her walk just as slowly as she did, stand in
front of the lifeguard, and start a conversation with him. Watching
another girl do what she just did, seeing what she must have looked
like, caused her arousal to spike again. She couldn’t take her eyes off
the naked Claire; she didn’t realize her hand had found its way to her
pussy and was slowly rubbing up and down it.<br> <br> Claire finally returned and got back into the tub.<br> <br> “Oh my god! That was embarrassing! I don’t think I could ever do something like that again! Lia, what are you doing?”<br> <br> Lia realized that Claire just caught her rubbing her pussy.<br> <br> “Oh…uh…nothing! I was just… I had an itch.”<br> <br> Whispering. “Were you just masturbating?”<br> <br> Lia hung her head a bit and nodded.<br> <br> “Keep going; I want to watch.”<br> <br>
Lia looked up at Claire, surprised at what she just heard. She then
looked to Trevor and the boys, who were now watching them, and to the
lifeguard, who was doing the same.<br> <br> “It's okay, Lia; don’t worry about them. Masturbate for me; I’ve never seen another girl do it before.”<br> <br>
Lia was so worked up, she needed this release. Her hand found its way
back between her spread legs and began to rub again. She started slow,
then increased speed. Soft little moans were escaping her slightly open
mouth; she could see Claire watching her intently. She closed her eyes
and increased her rubbing.<br> <br> Claire found the scene incredibly
hot; the little whimpers this younger girl was making were beautiful.
She looked so cute, making herself feel good. But she couldn’t really
see anything with the water jets going. The only thing she could see
were Lia's little tits that were just peeking out of the water.<br> <br> “Wait, stop for a second, Lia.”<br> <br> Lia opened her eyes again and gave a frustrated whimper, but she did as she was told and stopped.<br> <br> “I can’t see anything; you should sit on the edge of the hot tub.”<br> <br>
There was no way Lia could refuse this request in the state her mind
was in now. On shaky knees, Lia rose from the water and sat on the edge
of the tub. Now her entire body was out in the open again, except for
her shins dangling in the hot water. Lia spread her legs again, as wide
as she could, closed her eyes again, and resumed stroking her pussy and
clit. Her little moans are getting louder and faster. She was
increasing speed now; her hips started to thrust back and forth to aid
her hand. She was getting very close; it wouldn’t be long now.<br> <br> “Stop again, Lia; don’t cum yet.” Another command from Claire.<br> <br>
Lia again gave off very frustrated moans, even whining a bit. She
kicked her legs out a bit, like she was throwing a fit from the days
when she was younger. She opened her eyes again, but saw a completely
different scene in front of her. Along with Claire watching her, the
boys and her brother had made their way over to them. They were sitting
around the tub, laser-focused on the show Lia was giving. Even the
lifeguard had scooted his chair closer; all but Claire were sitting in
a way to hide what must have been erections. The power Lia’s body had
over males was incredible.<br> <br> “I wanted to see, and now that you
were being watched, Lia, Move your hands; let them get a good look at
you.” Claire commanded her.<br> <br> Lia moved her hands and let them all stare at her bald pussy.<br> <br> “I wanted you to see that all these boys are about to watch you cum."<br> <br> Lia whimpered again, a whimper that begged Claire to let her go on.<br> <br> “I want you to look them all in the eye and make eye contact with the boys that are going to watch you have a powerful orgasm.”<br> <br>
Lia looked at every boy. Not really making eye contact because they
couldn’t take their eyes off her pussy. Only Trevor looked her in the
eye; he simply smiled and winked at her, then returned his eyes to her
pussy.<br> <br> “They can see all of you; now show them how you cum."<br> <br>
Lia shot her hand back to her pussy, rubbing her clit faster than ever
now. She was full on moaning now, loudly. Lia slid her other hand down
to her vaginal opening and slipped in a finger. Lia didn’t have much
experience inserting anything in herself; the idea scared her because
of how tight she was around even a single finger, but that one finger
went to work pumping into her wet hole.<br> <br> Lia’s breathing was
becoming more difficult; she could feel all the muscles in her torso
begin to tense. It was harder and harder to take in air. Finally, Lia
cleared the horizon of pleasure; she threw her head back, kicked her
feet up, and her pussy was spasming violently. Lia tried to cry out,
but no sound came out. This often happens to her. Finally, she was able
to take in enough air to finish out her silent cry with a satisfied
grunt.<br> <br> Her orgasm was finally subsiding; she let her hands
fall away from her pussy, keeping her legs spread and her small chest
heaving up and down.<br> <br> Claire was going through powerful
feelings herself. She gave Lia embarrassing commands to follow, and the
girl followed them without question. Watching Lia masturbate was the
hottest thing she had ever seen; she looked so adorable, pleasuring
herself, so adorable and vulnerable. In that moment, Claire wanted
nothing more than to keep showing this girl off while also protecting
her. The idea of making a vulnerable Lia show herself off while also
making sure nothing hurt this adorably cute girl was a thrill that
Clarie had to have again. All of a sudden, she realized why Trevor did
what he did, and now she was insanely jealous that he could seemingly
do this anytime he wanted. Claire was turned on and needed exactly what
Lia just got, but she knew there was no way she would do it with this
many people around. She also realized another thing: Trevor was 100%
correct, Lia was definitely an exhibitionist. Claire didn’t want to
pile on to Lia; she wouldn’t tell her that she agrees with her brother.
Maybe if she keeps putting Lia in intense exposure situations, then the
girl might eventually realize it on her own.<br> <br> Lia, coming back
down to reality, slowly closed her legs again and sank back down into
the hot tub to get some level of cover again. The boys and Trevor were
still in awe of what they had just seen.<br> <br> Finally, Trevor has
regained his senses and managed to usher the younger boys back to the
pool. He felt that after everything Lia did tonight, she could use a
bit of a break.<br> <br> “That was amazing, Lia! I think I’m going to have to take care of myself when I get in the shower.”<br> <br> “You could always do it here, Clair. I’m sure the boys over there wouldn’t mind seeing that.”<br> <br> “No way! I’m not as brave as you are.”<br> <br> "Well, these days I don’t have a choice about people watching me masturbate, so it's not really being brave.”<br> <br>
“You weren’t being forced this time; you didn’t have to listen to me.
The ‘other part’ of you took over just now and made it easier to be in
front of other people naked. This is the kind of reaction we want to
train you to have more of.” Claire was laying it on a little thick; she
wanted to show Lia off more; hopefully next time she’ll have clothes
on. “Would you want to maybe do this again sometime? Maybe it won’t be
as intense as this time, but I think I can help you.” Claire was
hopeful.<br> <br> Lia thought for a moment that she did want to be
friends with this girl, and probably Zack and Leon too, since the three
were always together. “Okay, you can help me. I’m pretty nervous about
the idea, but you’re probably right. As long as my parents let me hang
out with you again, I am still being punished after all.”<br> <br>
Claire was elated; she was going to get another opportunity to expose
Lia. She silently promised herself that she would not do anything to
upset or hurt her. She was starting to really like Lia and thought it
would be nice to have a female friend. “We can figure that out later.
Thanks, Lia; I really think we could also have some fun too! Zack and
Leon are going to be so upset they missed the show,” Claire giggled.<br> <br> “Well… Have you thought that maybe you could put on the same show for them?” Lia slyly asked.<br> <br> "Oh, I don’t know about that; they may never look at me the same again.” Claire said it nervously.<br> <br> “I don’t think so; I just masturbated for you, and you don’t think less of me.”<br> <br> Claire was biting her lower lip, clearly thinking about it.<br> <br>
“They kind of deserve it, don’t you think? They both are out there
right now, trying to help you instead of hanging out with naked girls.”
Lia pressed.<br> <br> “Okay, you’re right. But you have to do it with
me; there's no way I can do it by myself. And I can’t do it tonight; I
really need to get back into my room before my parents catch me.”<br> <br> “Deal! Those boys have no idea how lucky they are.” Lia giggled. “Next time we hang out, we'll do it for them!”<br> <br> The girls sealed their deal with a hug, their naked breasts pressing into each other.<br> <br>
Just then, Zack and Leon returned at the same time. It was clear that
Zack didn’t find her clothes; he wasn’t carrying any, but maybe Leon
had better luck.<br> <br> Unfortunately for Claire, both boys had
struck out. Looking at the situation now, Claire realized that Leon had
no chance of getting a room key for a room that was not his. But the
boys had even worse news.<br> <br> “We ran into your parents, Claire.
We didn’t tell them where you were, but they are looking for you. They
saw that we were not at the convention; they looked worried when we
said we were looking for you too.” Zack told her.<br> <br> The color
drained from Claire’s face. “I’m dead; if they don’t find me soon,
they’ll get people at the convention involved, probably the hotel
staff, maybe even the cops!”<br> <br> “The guy at the front desk said
that you might be able to get the key yourself; if he recognizes you,
that's your only chance now.” Leon said.<br> <br> “The Lobby…” Claire was staring at the back wall.<br> <br>
“That's our best option now.” Lia told Claire, snapping her back to
reality. “I’ll go with you so you won’t be naked alone. I walked
through the lobby tonight; it was hard, but we can do it.”<br> <br> Lia
managed to get Claire out of the hot tub, showing off their naked
bodies to the boys and lifeguard once again. She got Trevor’s attention
and told him the plan: to get to the lobby and try to get Claire a key.
He agreed, and off the group went.<br> <br> The lobby was nearly as
crowded as it was the first time Lia walked through it; this time they
had to stand in line. Every head was once again turned on them. Lia
felt a bit better this time, not being naked alone.<br> <br> Claire was
doing her best to maintain her composure, keeping her hands at her
sides. “Thanks for being here with me, Lia; I really don’t have the
strength to be naked in public.”<br> <br> “Of course, you want to help
me, so I want to help you; it's what a friend would do.” Lia said the
last part in an almost-asking tone. She was basically asking Claire to
be her friend.<br> <br> “It sure is.” Claire smiled at Lia, and they were about to hug again when Claire heard the last thing she ever wanted to hear.<br> <br> “Claire! What in the hell are you doing, girl!?” A male voice yelled.<br> <br>
Claire and Lia whipped around to see who was yelling. It was the worst
thing Claire could have seen at that moment; her parents, she was
caught.<br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
