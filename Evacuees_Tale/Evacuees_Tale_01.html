is September 1939 and like thousands of wartime children, we find
13-year-old Edward Anderson and his best friend Robert Kemp, together
with their classmates Jennifer Garland and her twin sister Dawn, being
evacuated from their homes in London. They are heading for a quiet
fishing village in the English West Country where they will avoid the
anticipated German bombing of Britain’s capital city. The boys are
billeted in the cottage of Mrs Dalby and her three daughters Elizabeth
14, Gloria 12, and Faith 8, while the girls stay with her neighbour Mrs
Bentley, and her daughters, Rebecca 13 and Samantha 9. They find this
rural harbour a very different place from the poorest part of East
London where they have spent all their lives.</span><br><br>*****<br><br>My
name is Edward Anderson. I’m 13 and live in the docklands of East
London with just my mum. My story starts on Friday 1st September 1939
with mum listening to the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain on the
radio. I was barely paying any attention as he droned on and on in his
boring voice.<br><br>“I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10
Downing Street. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed
the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from
them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their
troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I&nbsp;have
to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that
consequently this country is at war with Germany.”<br><br>Mum suddenly let out a cry of anguish.<br><br>“Oh my God Edward, what are we going to do? We’re at war with the Germans.”<br><br>Just
then we heard the wail of the air raid sirens going off. They had been
testing them occasionally over the last few months. Was this for real?<br><br>“Quick Edward, we’ve got to get to the shelter in the new Bethnal Green Tube Station.”<br><br>When we got there, we met my best mate Bob Kemp with his mum. She was wittering on about something called evacuation.<br><br>“Yes
Mrs Anderson, it was on the radio. All children are to be sent away
from London to avoid the bombing. The evacuation started today, but
we’ve got to pack a suitcase and get our boys to Paddington Station by
10am tomorrow.”<br><br>“Where are the boys being sent Mrs Kemp?”<br><br>“That’s not yet clear. Somewhere in the West Country I think, where they will be safe from the bombing.”<br><br>My history teacher came up in his new Air Raid Warden’s uniform.<br><br>“Sorry Mrs Anderson, it’s a false alarm. Hitler’s not coming today, so you can get off back home now.”<br><br>He spoke to my mum, ignoring me and Bob as if we weren’t there.<br><br>“Evacuation
of your children is starting tomorrow. You don’t want to worry the
little tykes. Just tell them they’re going off on an exciting holiday.”<br><br>**********<br><br>It
was absolute chaos when we got to Paddington Station. There were kids
and mums crying, people rushing about all over the place, and no one to
ask what we had to do. Mum had found a battered suitcase, which I think
was my granddads. I had a luggage label on my lapel with my name and
other details and carried a cardboard box with my gas mask inside. I
was relieved to see Bob and his mum coming towards us. He had a label
around his neck, a bag over his shoulder and that cardboard box. He was
wearing long trousers, which made him look older than me. My mum still
made me wear short trousers like I was still a little kid. He looked as
nervous as me, since we knew our mums were not coming with us. This was
a time when a friend was going to be essential.<br><br>“Hi Bob. We’d
better stick together. We can say we’re cousins so we won’t be
separated when we get to our new homes, wherever that will be.”<br><br>He gave me a feeble smile.<br><br>“Sure Ed. That sounds like a plan.”<br><br>Up came this fat old lady with glasses and looked at our labels then scribbled something on her clipboard.<br><br>“Right you little boys. Say goodbye to your mummy and line up over there. Hurry along, the train leaves shortly.”<br><br>“Where are we going miss?”<br><br>“I don’t know. You’ll find out when you get there. Now hurry along unless you want a spanking.”<br><br>Mum chipped in.<br><br>“Don’t we get to know where our kids are going?”<br><br>The fat lady with the glasses looked irritated.<br><br>“I’ve got 50,000 kids to shift today, and no one’s told me. Your kids can send you a postcard when they get there.”<br><br>She glared down at me and Bob.<br><br>“You can write I suppose.”<br><br>I was a bit pissed off and was rather sharp with my reply.<br><br>“Of course we can!”<br><br>Her clipboard connected solidly with my head.<br><br>“Don’t you start getting cheeky with me boy.”<br><br>Before
I knew it, I was over her lap with my short trousers and underwear down
as she laid into me. Several girl classmates were only six feet away,
including my next-door neighbour, Jennifer Garland with that cute
freckle on the side of her nose, and her twin sister Dawn. All the
girls were giggling at my yelps as her hand reddened my bare bum. After
about 30 smacks she yanked me up. I had tears running down my cheeks as
I faced the grinning girls. They pointed at my willy and balls waving
in the breeze as I got berated for at least 30 seconds about how
ungrateful I was for everything that was being done for me. She landed
a final smack on my bum and shoved me over to the girls. With my
trousers and undies around my ankles I fell, landing at the feet of
Jennifer and Dawn. I looked up as the wind caught Jennifer’s dress.
There were her white frilly knickers. Please not now I thought. She
smiled down at me.<br><br>“Hi Eddie. Let me help you up.”<br><br>She
grabbed my right hand and put her other hand under my armpit as Dawn
did the same with the left hand. They lifted me up and their friends
all laughed at my 4-inch boner sticking out. Mum had a big grin as she
came round to my front and brushed the dirt off my legs and boner, then
pulled my undies up. She put her hands inside to rearrange my foreskin
and stiffie, then reached down and got my short trousers up, finally
fastening the belt. I must have gone scarlet at these girls all seeing
my willy, and my erect willy at that. My mum hadn’t seen it since I was
five, and she had not only seen my maturing willy now when it was all
stiff, but I’m pretty sure she deliberately squeezed it as she slid the
foreskin back over the head. She had little sympathy for my predicament.<br><br>“Serves you right Edward. That’s what you get if you’re rude to adults.”<br><br>The girls giggled as mum looked down and patted the bulge in my short trousers.<br><br>“It’s grown since I last bathed you.”<br><br>I went even redder as she gave me a big kiss on my cheek in front of the girls.<br><br>“I’ll say goodbye now. Send me a postcard when you get to your new home. Look after my little boy please Jennifer.”<br><br>Jennifer smiled at me again.<br><br>“I will Mrs Anderson.”<br><br>Another
lady with a clipboard came over and told us to line up with the others.
Dawn grabbed Bob as Jennifer grabbed my hand. She smiled so sweetly at
the lady then she told the same lie I was going to use.<br><br>“These are our cousins miss, and we told their mums we’d look after them miss.”<br><br>She looked us all over and gave Jennifer a big smile.<br><br>“These
are difficult times, and keeping families together is important. I’ll
note all four of your records to see you are kept together. I doubt
there will be someone who can take you all in the one house, but I’m
sure they can find two nearby houses with a room for two young ladies
and another with room for the two little boys.”<br><br>She ruffled my hair as she spoke to Jennifer. Why do adults do that?<br><br>When
we got on the train, Jennifer bagged a seat for four with a table
between us. I sat next to her as Dawn sat next to Bob. She looked at
me, then at Dawn, and giggled.<br><br>“That was hilarious seeing Eddie’s spanking, wasn’t it Dawn? You’d better not piss off any more adults Eddie.”<br><br>Dawn grinned at me. I must have gone red and was at a loss for words as Jennifer carried on.<br><br>“Did
you get a boner because of the spanking? Our 16-year-old brother Jim
always goes hard after mum spanks him. It’s always fun to watch as he
has to stand there while mum gets him bare before he goes over her lap
to get spanked with his very own slipper. His willy and balls are much
bigger than yours Ed and he’s a lot more hair down there too.”<br><br>Dawn nodded in agreement with her twin. I couldn’t possibly tell her my stiffie was the result of seeing her knickers.<br><br>“Err… It… err… does that… err… sometimes… err… Jennifer.”<br><br>I squeaked as she moved her hand under the table and grabbed the front of my short trousers.<br><br>“I can feel it’s gone down now Eddie. Don’t boys’ willys look so weird Dawn, especially when they go stiff.”<br><br>Dawn giggled as I saw her hand reach under the table.<br><br>“How big is yours Bob?”<br><br>She grinned at him as she felt his trouser front.<br><br>“That feels very interesting Bob.”<br><br>My friend smiled back at her as she copped a feel.<br><br>“It’s a bit public here, but no doubt we could find somewhere quiet when we get to wherever it is we’re going.”<br><br>I
got out a book to pass the time away. Jennifer had dozed off and was
leaning into me. She had a hand resting on my stomach which felt so
warm and lovely. As I turned towards that cute freckle, I realised I
could see right down her blouse and vest as she breathed in and out.
The gap was continually changing, and I kept seeing an expanse of pink
curves with two nipples sticking out. They had a brownish ring around
them. It was the most wonderful sight ever.<br><br>It must have been
some 10 minutes later when the carriage gave a sudden jolt as we went
over some points and she woke with a start. She lifted her head to look
at me and I went red. She instantly realised where my eyes had been
focussed and gave a grin as her hand went south to grip the front of my
short trousers. She leant in close and smiled so sweetly as she
whispered in my ear.<br><br>“If you ever look down there again, I’ll snap this off.”<br><br>I went scarlet at being busted and my willy collapsed in fear.<br><br>“Err… I’m… err… so sorry… err… Jennifer.”<br><br>She
lifted her hand up to my chin and grinned as she saw me breathe again.
She moved my chin round, and I was astonished as she came in to gently
kiss my lips. She pulled slowly away and gave another smile as she
whispered.<br><br>“When I want you looking at what’s down there Eddie, I’ll let you know. Meanwhile, keep your eyes up here.”<br><br>Was she saying I might get to see them sometime? Good job she’d removed her hand, as it went hard again.<br><br>“Err… Yes Jennifer… err… I will.”<br><br>We went over some more points and Bob and Dawn stirred. Bob yawned and looked out the window.<br><br>“Any idea where we are?”<br><br>I hadn’t a clue, but Jennifer had seen something.<br><br>“We went through Taunton earlier, so I guess we will be coming into Exeter soon.”<br><br>Just then a friendly looking guard came past. Jennifer gave him her sweetest smile.<br><br>“Do you know where we are headed sir?”<br><br>“We
will be in Exeter in 10 minutes, where we split the train. These rear
four carriages will go on to North Cornwall with me. My mate George
will be taking the front carriages, which go on ahead of us fast to
Plymouth, then stopping at all stations down to Penzance. I think your
group has been allocated to stay with someone in Polkerry.”<br><br>“How much longer will it be sir?”<br><br>“You’ll be all settled in by six. I grew up there, and you’ll love being by the sea. Where do you kids all come from?”<br><br>“We’re from a place in London called Bethnal Green sir. I’m Jennifer Garland, and this is my twin sister Dawn sir.”<br><br>“You’re a polite young lady, and that’s for sure. How do I tell you from your sister?”<br><br>Jennifer giggled and pointed to the side of her nose.<br><br>“I’ve got this freckle on my nose sir.”<br><br>“I’m pleased to meet you Jennifer Freckle. Are these your friends?”<br><br>She chuckled at the nickname he chose to use and decided to maintain the lie she began the day with.<br><br>“These are my cousins sir. I promised their mums I’d look after them, and we hope to be accommodated together sir.”<br><br>He smiled at me and Bob.<br><br>“You’re two very lucky lads to be looked after by such a sweet young lady.”<br><br>We just smiled back.<br><br>“I’ll see you all later Jennifer Freckle. I’ve got a lot to do when we get to Exeter.”<br><br>**********<br><br>It had been two hours since we left Exeter when the guard came past and smiled.<br><br>“We’re
approaching Polkerry Road station Jennifer Freckle. This is where your
group gets off. There will be a charabanc from the station to the
village hall where you will be allocated to your new homes. My sister
Jean Bentley lives in Polkerry with her two daughters and is handling
the allocation of evacuees like you kids. You tell her Tom sent you and
mention that I would like her to see you’re all sorted as a favour to
me. It’s a lovely place for you kids to stay. I know you’ll get a true
Cornish welcome there. Mind you, best not to get the wrong side of the
old headmaster. He was to retire this year but they’re keeping him on,
what with all you extra evacuees to teach. Whacker Richardson we called
him. You girls only got to do lines, but he was a demon with the cane
if a boy didn’t do as he was told.”<br><br>He laughed and rubbed his rear.<br><br>“Many is the time I came home from school and had to stand to eat my tea. Mum and my sisters always laughed.”<br><br>It
was just after 5pm when we pulled into the station. We waved goodbye to
the guard as we went out into the car park and got on this open-topped
ancient motor coach. It took about 10 minutes along a narrow
single-track road when we saw the first signpost to our new home
‘Polkerry 2 miles’. As we reached the top of a hill, the vista opened
up to see the village about a mile ahead in a steep-sided green valley
with a blue sea beyond. Jennifer smiled.<br><br>“I’ve never seen the sea before Eddie. With all those green fields, it looks so pretty. We’re going to have fun here.”<br><br>We
pulled up outside a large stone building with a tatty sign that
announced this was the village hall. The four of us hung back until
last. We went in to see our school chums lined up on the stage with
women looking them over. There was a lady with a clipboard who looked
like she was in charge. As one by one the women said, ‘I’ll have this
one’, she would scribble something on her clipboard and off they would
go. Jennifer went up to her.<br><br>“Excuse me miss, are you Jean Bentley?”<br><br>She had a big smile as she looked down at Jennifer.<br><br>“I am indeed my dear, and who are you?”<br><br>“I’m
Jennifer Garland miss. This is my sister Dawn and the boys are Edward
Anderson and Robert Kemp. We’re cousins miss. I promised their mums
that I’d look after them. We were hoping we could all be placed
together miss. Your brother Tom was the guard on our train, and he said
he would like you to get us sorted as a favour to him miss.”<br><br>“I’m afraid all the larger houses are already filled.”<br><br>We all looked at each other, worried we would be split up. Mrs Bentley looked at our disappointed faces and smiled.<br><br>“I
have a plan. I can take you two girls, and my neighbour, Mrs Dalby,
told me she could accommodate two children. We could put you two boys
in with her, so you would be next door to each other. How does that
sound?”<br><br>We all agreed that was great.<br><br>“That’s you four all settled then. You and your sister are like two peas in a pod. How are we going to tell you apart?”<br><br>Jennifer giggled as she pointed to that cute freckle.<br><br>“I’ve got this freckle on my nose. Your brother kept calling me Jennifer Freckle.”<br><br>“That’s
my brother for you. Now, if you would just pop over to Janice, she’ll
give you some tea and cake. When you’ve eaten, I’ll take you to meet my
two daughters, and Mrs Dalby with her three daughters. You’ll soon fit
in.”<br><br>As we ate our cake, I was wondering what the Dalbys would
be like. I’d never been in a house with girls and wondered if they
would get bathed in a tin bath in front of the fire like I always was.
My willy went stiff at the thought of seeing my first naked girl. Then
I had another less pleasant thought about whether they would be
watching me get my bath. Mrs Bentley brought me back to reality.<br><br>“There, I’m all done. Let’s get you four settled in.”<br><br>We
went down the hill two by two, with Jennifer holding my hand as Dawn
held Bob’s. We turned into a narrow alley barely wide enough for the
two of us and came out in a slightly wider street. The houses on each
side had tiny gardens in front, and in one of them was a cheerful lady
with three girls leaning on the fence. The middle girl looked straight
in my eyes, so I gave her a smile. As we approached, two girls came out
of the adjoining small house.<br><br>“Hi mum. Are these our evacuees. Surely we can’t take all four.”<br><br>Before she could reply, the cheerful lady spoke.<br><br>“Good
evening Mrs Bentley. Betty told me you had two boys for me. They look
handsome. My girls have never had a boy in the house before and are
looking forward to that. Let me introduce the girls to you youngsters.
This is Elizabeth my oldest, who’s 14. This is Gloria who’s 12, and the
baby of the family is Faith. She’s 8.”<br><br>The three girls all grinned at me and Bob. Mrs Bentley then smiled at her two girls.<br><br>“See
girls, Mrs Dalby will be looking after the boys. Let me introduce them
all. This is Jennifer Garland and her twin sister Dawn. The boys are
their cousins, Edward Anderson and Robert Kemp. They are all 13.”<br><br>The youngest Dalby girl had a puzzled look as she stared at the twins.<br><br>“How do we tell you apart?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled at her and pointed to that cute freckle.<br><br>“I’m Jennifer and I’ve got this freckle.”<br><br>She came over to inspect both twins’ noses very closely.<br><br>“Oh yes, so you have. It’s obvious once you pointed it out.”<br><br>Mrs Bentley then introduced her two girls.<br><br>“This
is Samantha and she’s 9. Her big sister is Rebecca who is the same age
as you. Now Mrs Dalby, would you take the boys and settle them in as I
get the girls all sorted?”<br><br>The house looked tiny but was going to be home for the near future. At least Jennifer and Dawn will be next door.<br><br>**********<br><br>Mum
had told us the village was going to receive a whole load of evacuees,
but I was a bit surprised when Mrs Sweet came in and said Mrs Bentley
had got two 13-year-old boys for us to look after. I’ve never lived in
a house with boys before. My big sister Liz said she hoped they were
cute. Faith giggled as she looked at me.<br><br>“We might get to watch
them being bathed in front of the fire Gloria. My friend Jane said her
little brother has got such a cute little winkle and she loves watching
it wobble about as he gets bathed. When her mum slides the skin back to
pop the little head out, she creases up. Jane says it often grows and
sticks up as her mum rubs soap all over it, but I’m not sure about
that. I’ve watched my boy classmates swimming in the harbour, and I’ve
noticed their winkles always shrink when they get wet. These evacuee
boys will be much older, and I wonder if a big boy looks different.”<br><br>A horrible thought struck me, and I turned to Liz.<br><br>“What if they get to see us being bathed Liz? I would die if I were seen naked by boys.”<br><br>Liz looked anxious.<br><br>“I’ll have a word with mum. I’m sure she wouldn’t let that happen.”<br><br>That was when mum walked in and saw our worried faces.<br><br>“What wouldn’t I let happen? Is there something wrong girls?”<br><br>Liz spoke for us all.<br><br>“Err…
Mum… err… we’ve never had boys in the house before… err… and… err…
we’re wondering about… err… bath night. We don’t want boys seeing us…
err… naked… err… when we bath… err… in front of the fire.”<br><br>“Girls
must have their modesty, so that won’t happen. It would be most
improper for boys to see girls when they are being bathed. I’ll make
sure the boys are in their bedroom when it is your bath night.”<br><br>Faith giggled again.<br><br>“Will
we get to see the boys when they are being bathed mum? Jane said it’s
fun watching their little winkles wobbling about as they get washed.
Can we mum? Please mum, pretty please?”<br><br>Mum raised her eyes to heaven and tutted.<br><br>“You
girls! Well, I suppose that as you will all be mothers one day, you do
need to know how to bath little boys and their winkles, so you can all
help me with their bath night. It will have been a long day for them,
so they will no doubt be glad of one tonight. Would you light the
boiler please Elizabeth, to get the hot water ready?”<br><br>That was a
huge weight off our minds. I was so happy as I looked across at my
sisters. Faith had a grin from ear to ear, and Liz was smiling and
happily humming a tune as she went to get the boiler going.<br><br>Mrs
Sweet said Mrs Bentley would be here in about 15 minutes, so we were
all leaning on the fence as we first saw the evacuees come through the
alley. My big sister giggled.<br><br>“The boy in the long trousers looks cute. I shall enjoy bathing him.”<br><br>I
was staring at the one in the short trousers. He had a rugged charm,
and as he came closer, he gave me a smile. I was surprised to get a
very peculiar feeling in my private parts. Faith had noticed the girls
were identical twins.<br><br>“How are we going to tell the girls apart?”<br><br>After introductions were made, Faith wanted an answer to her question.<br><br>“How do we tell you apart?”<br><br>One of the twins smiled at her and pointed to her nose.<br><br>“I’m Jennifer and I’ve got this freckle.”<br><br>My little sister had no shame as she inspected both twins’ noses very closely.<br><br>“Oh yes, so you have. It’s obvious once you pointed it out.”<br><br>Mrs
Bentley introduced Beccy and Sam to the evacuees, then mum took the
boys inside to show them round. I had noticed they were unconsciously
scratching, and then I saw something tiny hop off the boy in the short
trousers.<br><br>“What was that mum?”<br><br>“What was what Gloria?”<br><br>“Something hopped off this boy’s jacket.”<br><br>Mum inspected the jacket closely, then she shoved the boys out the back door.<br><br>“Out in the yard you two. Get those clothes off. I’m not having any fleas in my house.”<br><br>The boys started to argue, but mum was in full flow.<br><br>“Get
those clothes off NOW! They will all have to be fumigated and washed,
and you boys will be getting bathed with carbolic soap tonight.”<br><br>They were still not moving, so mum turned to me and Liz.<br><br>“I’ll
get this boy undressed, you two get that one undressed. Put all the
clothes in this sack so we can deal with them. Good job we got the
boiler going. You bring that bag and the suitcase out here Faith, so we
can do all their clothes.”<br><br>Mum launched into the boy with the
long trousers. Despite his protests, he was no match for her. Liz and I
looked determinedly at the other boy and, seeing his friend’s futile
efforts, he started to take his jacket off. We glared at him to keep up
the pressure and he was soon down to his underpants, then he stopped.
Mum nodded at me, and I grinned as we pulled down their underpants in
unison. I saw my boy had a bigger willy than any of the little boys I
had seen swimming in the harbour, and he had some hair there too.
Looking over to the other boy, his willy was huge at over 5 inches long
and had thick black hair all round it. He also had two large
plum-shaped things dangling below in a hairy sac. I was puzzled as his
willy looked different, with a large purple head instead of my boy’s
point of skin. The boy with the big willy went to cover up but mum gave
him an almighty smack on his bottom.<br><br>“Get those hands on your head or it’s a full-on spanking.”<br><br>My
boy tried the same, so I gave his bottom a smack. The boys went scarlet
as they did as they were told. Liz had a huge grin on her face as she
stared at these two naked boys. She looked at me and whispered.<br><br>“A bit more than a freckle separates these two evacuees.”<br><br>I
had to agree with my big sister and giggled. That was when Faith came
in to see two naked 13-year-old boys. She walked up to my boy and
grabbed his willy.<br><br>“Wow mum. Their winkles are much bigger than
any I’ve seen on my classmates. That boy has such a lot of hair down
there, and his huge winkle looks different to this one. What are those
big things he has dangling down mum?”<br><br>“Just a minute dear. I’ll call out Mrs Bentley… Err… Jean, are you there?”<br><br>Mrs
Bentley came out with the four girls in tow. Beccy and Sam’s eyes went
wide to see two naked evacuee boys on full display in our yard. Their
twin cousins just smirked at them.<br><br>“Err… Jean, we have a
problem. The boys have fleas, and I’m pretty certain we are going to
find lice too. Err… You will have to check the girls as well, I fear.
They’d better get their clothes off too.”<br><br>Faith let go of my boy’s willy, and I was astonished as it grew before my eyes. My little sister began to giggle.<br><br>“Mum,
it’s alive. His winkle is growing and sticking up. The other boy’s is
enormous now. Jane said a winkle does that when it gets soaped, but we
haven’t even started to bath these boys yet. Why are their winkles
doing that mum?”<br><br>**********<br><br>As Bob and me went in, the
girls followed behind. Their cottage was a bit small, but we would
probably manage. The middle girl gave me a smile, so I smiled at her,
then she suddenly jumped back and said to her mum that something hopped
off my jacket. Mrs Dalby came over, then looked angry as she bundled us
out the back door.<br><br>“Out in the yard you two. Get those clothes off. I’m not having any fleas in my house.”<br><br>We
weren’t getting naked in front of these girls and began arguing. Mrs
Dalby was taking no nonsense as Bob’s jacket got thrown off, then she
reached for his shirt. The two older girls glared at me, making it
plain that if I didn’t get my stuff off, they would. With no choice, I
was soon down to my undies, but couldn’t possibly go further with the
girls there. That was when I saw Gloria grin at her mum. They grabbed
our elastic and slid mine and Bob’s down together. We both tried to
cover up. Bob got a smack on his bum from Mrs Dalby, and I was shocked
to receive a similar whack from Gloria. She hurt! Her mum told us to
put our hands on our heads or we’d get a spanking. We went scarlet as
the girls grinned as they looked us up and down, particularly down. I
had never seen Bob naked and could not help but notice he was much
bigger than me. He was circumcised too. That was when little Faith
appeared.<br><br>“Wow mum. Their winkles are much bigger than any I’ve seen on my classmates.”<br><br>She looked at Bob as she lifted up my willy.<br><br>“That
boy has such a lot of hair down there, and his huge winkle looks
different to this one. What are those big things he has dangling down
mum?”<br><br>Mrs Dalby didn’t answer but called over to her neighbour.
Mrs Bentley came out with the four girls in tow. Her two girls giggled,
and their eyes went wide as they saw us standing naked. Jennifer and
Dawn gave us both a huge smirk.<br><br>“Err… Jean, we have a problem.
The boys have fleas, and I’m pretty certain we are going to find lice
too. Err… You will have to check the girls as well, I fear. They’d
better get all their clothes off too.”<br><br>Their smirks faded. Bob
and I grinned as we were going to see the twins stripped naked. The
little girl suddenly dropped my willy as she felt it throb.<br><br>“Mum,
it’s alive. His winkle is growing and sticking up. The other boy’s is
enormous now. Jane said a winkle does that when it gets soaped, but we
haven’t even started to bath these boys yet. Why are their winkles
doing that mum?”<br><br>We were both sporting full on boners. Bob’s
must have been 7 inches, putting my thinner 4 inch one in the shade.
Jennifer and Dawn had gone red as they started to unbutton their
blouses. Mrs Bentley looked horrified.<br><br>“Not out here in front of the boys! Let’s get you girls some privacy. Go in the kitchen as I draw the curtains.”<br><br>She quickly bustled them off, followed by a swish of the curtains. Mrs Dalby then turned to her girls.<br><br>“You girls won’t have seen older boy parts before. I’ll answer Faith’s questions, so you’ll all learn about boys.”<br><br>She grabbed my boner.<br><br>“These
boys are going through what is known as puberty, when their boy parts
get bigger as they mature and become adult. This is properly called a
penis. Penises of older boys like these two will frequently grow and
get stiff. Edward’s is about average for a 13-year-old boy. Going stiff
is all quite natural, and boys have almost no control over when it does
that. This hole at the end is where boys pee comes out. As you can see,
Robert’s is much bigger because he has finished puberty. It is also why
he has much more hair down here. Those things swinging below are
testicles. Boys have two in this sac, known as the scrotum. Mature
testicles produce the sperm that makes a baby when it fertilizes a
girl’s egg. It comes out of this same hole at the end. Edward’s smaller
testicles are only just beginning to dangle. Robert’s parts are all
fully adult, although I suspect he’ll still act like a naughty little
boy at times.”<br><br>My mum had never told me any of this, and I was fascinated.<br><br>“Faith asked why their penises look different. They’re not really that different.”<br><br>She yanked my foreskin right back.<br><br>“When
I pull this loose skin right back you will see they look the same. Some
boys get this skin cut off soon after they are born. That is known as
being circumcised, and some religions require all boys to be
circumcised.”<br><br>She turned to Bob.<br><br>“You’re not Jewish, are you?”<br><br>“Err…
No miss. Mum married again after my dad died, and my new dad took me to
a clinic last year to get it done. He said it would look neater and be
easier to keep clean. It hurt a bit at first, but it’s fine now. I
think dad was right miss.”<br><br>She looked down at my boner with its exposed head.<br><br>“Keeping
boy’s penises clean is very important to avoid a build-up of this
smelly white stuff. When did you last clean under here Edward?”<br><br>“Err… I’m not sure miss.”<br><br>She turned back to the girls.<br><br>“When
you bath Edward, you must always slide this skin right back and wash
thoroughly under there. If this white stuff is left, he could get an
infection. You can see it is already a bit red here, but carbolic soap
will get rid of that.”<br><br>Oh my God, the girls really are going to bath us. Why did it just get stiffer?<br><br>“Right girls. Education over, I need to check their hair for lice.”<br><br>She held Bob’s head and peered closely as she parted his hair, then grabbed me and did the same.<br><br>“The boys have head lice. Let’s see what else they have.”<br><br>She knelt down and grabbed my willy, then checked my sparse hair, before doing the same to Bob’s much hairier bits.<br><br>“As I thought, they have lice down here too. You two boys stay right there.”<br><br>As if we had anywhere to go in this state. She shot inside, to come out a few minutes later with an armful of stuff.<br><br>“We’ll
have to cut all that hair off. I’ve got these clippers and scissors,
together with your late father’s razor. I’ll use the clippers to do
both their heads. Gloria, you can use the scissors to cut off most of
the hair down there. Elizabeth, use this to lather everywhere first,
then you can shave all round their penises and scrotums to remove the
rest. Faith, you can help your sisters, so just do as they tell you. I
want to see the boys end up as smooth as a baby’s bottom all over. Put
the hair in this paper bag so it can go straight on the fire.”<br><br>She gave a chuckle, and I nearly fainted at what she said.<br><br>“Elizabeth, be careful with that razor on Edward. I’m sure he doesn’t want to be circumcised… or worse!”<br><br>Mrs
Dalby made short work of Bob’s head and was attacking mine as Gloria
cut most of the hair off around his willy and balls. He looked
extremely worried as Elizabeth was let loose with the razor while Faith
held his parts out for her. Like mine, his willy had shrunk back down
in fear at the sight of the razor. Gloria gave me a big smile, but I
was nearly in tears as I nervously watched my newly grown hair fall to
the ground. I began to shake as Elizabeth came towards me with that
cut-throat razor. Faith giggled.<br><br>“Look at his willy, it’s trembling.”<br><br>Elizabeth gave my bum a sharp smack, which hurt.<br><br>“Hold still boy, or I might accidentally cut it off.”<br><br>That didn’t help as I shook even more.<br><br>“Faith, you hold his penis really tight, so it doesn’t move while I’m shaving him.”<br><br>She
put both hands all round it and squeezed. At least Faith would now get
cut before my willy did. Her sister lathered all round, and a dozen
deft strokes later I could breathe again. Mrs Dalby then felt between
our legs.<br><br>“Excellent job girls. They are so smooth now and both
look like little boys. Faith, you pick up all this hair and put it
straight on the fire. I’ll get all their clothes in the boiler, whilst
Elizabeth and Gloria bath these boys with this carbolic soap. It’s a
mild evening, so set the tin bath up out here. We can all see how very
dirty they are and I’m not having them back in my house until you’ve
got them spotless. You’d better use these scrubbing brushes all over. I
need the hot water for their clothes, but cold water from the outside
tap won’t hurt them. If you start with their top half, by the time the
washing is all under way, I’ll be free to show you how to wash boy
parts properly.”<br><br>Mrs Dalby went inside as Gloria set the tin
bath down right next to the tap and began to fill it up. I looked
around to see two young girls about Faith’s age watching us from a
window opposite. I went to cover up, only to get a smack on my bum from
Elizabeth, which made those girls point and laugh. The bath had about 5
inches of water in it, when Gloria turned off the tap.<br><br>“In you get boys.”<br><br>I dipped my toe in, only to jerk it straight back out of the water. It was freezing!<br><br>“It’s so cold Gloria.”<br><br>“Oh, don’t be such a little baby. Now get in both of you, so we can get you all clean.”<br><br>Gingerly putting a toe back in, we went to pull it out, only to gasp as the girls shoved us in and under the water.<br><br>“Stop making such a fuss.”<br><br>The girls had soaped and scrubbed our top halves when I heard a girl’s voice behind me.<br><br>“Hello Faith. Are these your two evacuees?”<br><br>Turning my head round, I saw it was the two girls who had been at the window and were now leaning over the fence.<br><br>“Yes Jane, they are.”<br><br>Faith giggled as she looked down.<br><br>“Now don’t be rude boys. Stand up and say hello to Jane and her little sister Josie.”<br><br>Elizabeth gave us an encouraging smack, so we had no option.<br><br>“Err… Hello Jane… err… hello Josie.”<br><br>We knew where the girls would be looking and went red as they acted true to form. Josie pointed at me.<br><br>“I though these were big boys. His willy is the same as my little brother Fred, and he’s only four.”<br><br>I
looked down and was aghast to see the effect of the freezing water.
Having been shaved too, we both looked like pre-schoolers. That was
when Mrs Dalby came out. She looked right between our legs, then smiled
at the two girls.<br><br>“Hello Josie, hello Jane. I see you’ve met our two little boys. We’re just giving them a bath, as they are filthy.”<br><br>She turned to her girls.<br><br>“Now,
let me show you how to wash boys. This will be very good experience for
you girls, as one day you will have your own little boys to look after.
Jane and Josie, you might as well stay and learn about boys too. Right
Edward, you sit back down while I use Robert to show the girls how to
wash boys.”<br><br>I was happy to sit back down. Mrs Dalby soaped her
hands, then told him to bend over. She opened his cheeks and rubbed
that smelly soap all round. He squeaked as she pushed her finger in his
bum hole. Even when I was six and my mum used to wash me, she never did
that.<br><br>“You must always soap round here, and do inside as well, so a little boy is properly clean.”<br><br>She told Bob to stand up, then grabbed his willy, which had shrunk down to about two inches, then cupped his balls.<br><br>“You have to wash all round this very grubby boy’s scrotum and testicles to remove the sweat collecting here.”<br><br>She was rubbing quite vigorously when I saw Josie start to giggle.<br><br>“His willy’s getting bigger Mrs Dalby.”<br><br>“That happens to boys sometimes Josie. It’s quite natural and boys have no control over it. It can get even bigger.”<br><br>She turned to her girls.<br><br>“One
very obvious boy part you must pay particular attention to is their
penis. Now Robert here is circumcised, but when washing a boy like
Edward you must pull back the loose skin and clean very thoroughly
under there. You need to soap your hands very well, then rub all along
the penis like this.”<br><br>Bob was now at full attention and grinning as I saw Jane’s eyes go wide.<br><br>“Wow, Mrs Dalby. Fred’s willy sticks up sometimes when he gets bathed, but this boy has gone huge.”<br><br>“Robert
is older than your Fred, so has a bigger penis. Now girls, you must
clean thoroughly around his mushroom shaped head, as well as this bit
of skin below the boy’s little slit, as all sorts of grime can lodge in
the nooks and crannies here.”<br><br>She was soaping all over the end
when Bob started to breathe funny. His face was one of pure pleasure as
he gave out a long groan and white stuff shot out of the end. What was
happening? Gloria had the same thought.<br><br>“What’s happening mum? What is that white stuff? Is Robert hurt?”<br><br>Mrs Dalby grinned at Bob.<br><br>“Did that hurt Robert?”<br><br>My best friend had the goofiest grin ever as he replied.<br><br>“No miss. It felt fantastic miss.”<br><br>“There
you are girls. Robert’s not hurt at all. This can happen when you wash
an older boy’s penis. I used to bath your late father before you were
all born, and he always enjoyed that. The white stuff is called semen,
and contains the sperm made in his testicles. Squirting like this is a
reflex action outside a boy’s control.”<br><br>She squeezed all along
his collapsing willy, picking off the large white drop that oozed from
the end with her finger. She showed it to Gloria before letting all the
girls see. Josie giggled as she leant over the fence to touch the drop.
She rubbed her fingers together then brought them up to her nose.<br><br>“It’s sticky Mrs Dalby and smells funny.”<br><br>Faith touched it and moved her little finger to her mouth. She screwed her face up.<br><br>“Yuk! It tastes horrid mum.”<br><br>“Now
girls, that has shown you how to wash boy parts. They are both very
dirty, so will need to be washed twice. Elizabeth can wash Robert
again, while Gloria washes Edward. Elizabeth, you can monitor Faith as
she gives Edward his second bath.”<br><br>Gloria smiled at me.<br><br>“Edward has a smaller penis. Will he squirt mum?”<br><br>Her mum looked at me.<br><br>“Does your penis squirt yet Edward?”<br><br>This was all new to me, as mum had told me nothing about any of this.<br><br>“Err… I don’t think so miss.”<br><br>She gave me one of those stern glares that said, ‘don’t lie to me’.<br><br>“Have you ever woken up in the morning with sticky pyjamas?”<br><br>Faith giggled.<br><br>“Why would a boy get sticky pyjamas mum?”<br><br>“Sometimes dear, semen squirts out while the boy is sleeping.”<br><br>“Eeewww mum. That’s disgusting.”<br><br>“It’s all quite natural with boys. Mums often need to clean older boy’s sheets more often as they go through puberty.”<br><br>She turned back to me with that glare. I had to tell her the truth.<br><br>“Never miss.”<br><br>She turned to Gloria.<br><br>“When you wash Edward’s penis, it probably won’t squirt yet. I’ll get back to the laundry and leave you girls to it.”<br><br>As Mrs Dalby went inside, Gloria grinned down at me.<br><br>“Up you get Edward. Turn round so I can do your bottom first.”<br><br>Elizabeth
was busy washing Bob again, but four pairs of girls’ eyes were waiting
for me to get up. This was so embarrassing, and I must have gone red,
but Gloria’s earlier smack still smarted so I had to comply. As I
turned round, I heard Sophie’s giggle.<br><br>“Look at that red handprint on his bottom. Was he a naughty boy Gloria?”<br><br>“He wouldn’t put his hands on his head, so I gave him a spank. Are you going to do as you’re told now Edward?”<br><br>What else could I say?<br><br>“Err… Yes Gloria.”<br><br>I felt her part my bum cheeks. These girls should not be seeing there.<br><br>“You are very dirty here Edward. When did you last wipe your bottom?”<br><br>“Err… err… err…”<br><br>I shrieked as her hand landed sharply across my bum.<br><br>“You
naughty boy. You must always wipe your bottom after you go to the
toilet. I will have to take the scrubbing brush to all this. Now hold
still and don’t make a sound, or it’s another smacked bottom for you.”<br><br>The scrubbing brush hurt, but then she pushed her finger in and wiggled it. That felt rather nice, but she pulled out.<br><br>“OK Edward. Turn round so I can do your front.”<br><br>As
I got up, the girls giggled as they saw I had a boner. Gloria grabbed
my balls and started to soap all round and between my legs. This was
the first time a girl had handled me there and I felt it get stiffer.
It also began to feel a bit funny. She then gripped my boner and slid
back my foreskin. Gloria gave a sniff and screwed up her face.<br><br>“Mum said I have to clean this smelly stuff off.”<br><br>As
she started to soap it up, I saw Bob had that goofy grin as Elizabeth
washed his willy. Then he groaned as that white stuff shot out to go
all over Faith, who had leaned in for a closer look.<br><br>“Eeewww… Liz, he got me.”<br><br>Her big sister told her just to wipe it off as she squeezed along his willy to get the last bit out. Gloria grinned at me.<br><br>“OK Edward. Let’s see what you can do.”<br><br>She rubbed her soapy hands all over it. I felt like I needed to pee and tried to pull away, only to get a sharp smack.<br><br>“Stay still Edward!”<br><br>I
had never felt anything like it before. It was fantastic as it went so
hard, then I groaned like Bob as it began to pulse. Gloria grinned at
me, then looked down as she squeezed along my collapsing willy. She
looked disappointed.<br><br>“Oh, nothing’s come out.”<br><br>I was still trying to calm down when Faith grabbed the soap.<br><br>“My turn now. Turn round and bend over Edward.”<br><br>Gloria
was tasked with towelling off Bob, who was still grinning as she dried
his floppy willy and balls. Jane and Josie were grinning too as they
watched Faith go through the same routine as Gloria, supervised by her
oldest sister. It didn’t feel so great as when Gloria did it. After
getting me dry, we went back inside with Faith and Elizabeth, leaving
Gloria to deal with the bathtub. When she came back in, I got a smile
from her, then Mrs Dalby gave us all our supper.<br><br>After eating,
the girls got some candles and took us up the ladder into the attic
where we would be sleeping. Gloria went first and as I looked up, there
were her navy-blue knickers. Faith giggled as she saw the immediate
effect. Gloria looked back and grinned.<br><br>“Now now sis, mum told us boys have no control over their willys.”<br><br>As all five of us got through the hatch and into the attic, Gloria smiled at me then looked down.<br><br>“You look so cute with it sticking up.”<br><br>It
went harder as she gave me a sweet peck on my cheek, then showed us
round our room for the foreseeable future. Not that there was much to
see, as the furniture comprised an old chest of drawers, a small
wardrobe and two made up beds. All our clothes were hanging on the line
in the yard, including our pyjamas, so I knew we would be sleeping
naked. I wondered whether Jennifer and Dawn would also be naked. That
gave me a boner, but to tell the truth we were both past caring after
such a day, and happily slid under the blankets to wonder what tomorrow
would bring.<br><br><br><br>
