<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Chapter 1</span><br>
<br>
My mom and dad always sent me off to summer camp every June.
Don’t get
me wrong, I always had a fun time, but it took me away from my friends,
and…<br>
<br>
Well, and the girl I like. The girl I have a crush on.
Her name is Candice. She is the proverbial girl next door, although she
actually lives across the street from me. She had moved into that house
about 5 years ago. Before then an elderly couple had lived in that
house, but they had retired down to Florida. Candice and I had hit it
off great, and become fast friends. The thing is, I don’t
think she has
any idea that I like her, or knows just how pretty I think she is.
I’m
all but certain she could never have any feelings towards me in that
way.<br>
<br>
We were in the in-between summer now, as both of us had
just finished the 9th grade, and that meant next year we would be
making the leap to high school. Our last three years of school, and of
this kind of freedom, before we would head off to college. Two weeks
after school had let out, I had headed off to camp. Now I was just
arriving back home, thankful that I could finally sleep in my own bed,
and in a room all to myself.<br>
<br>
The first thing I wanted to do
was talk to Candice. Camp had a strict no cell phone policy, so I
hadn’t even been able to text her. I wanted to hear her voice
though,
so I decided to call. My mom wasn’t going to let me leave the
house
until I unpacked, I knew that for sure. Maybe Candice would want to
come straight over to see me?<br>
<br>
I tried her cell phone, but got nothing. I tried her home phone next.
It rang a few times, then her mom picked up.<br>
<br>
“Hi, Mrs. Simmons. Is Candice there?” I asked her
mom.<br>
<br>
“Candice has gotten herself into a bit of trouble.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, what happened?” I asked with concern.<br>
<br>
“I think it would be best if she explained it to you herself.
Let me
get her for you.” She explained, setting the phone down for a
minute. I
could hear her calling for my friend, and then some crackling noise
before she picked up the receiver.<br>
<br>
Her tone sounded kind of down when she started talking, “Hey
Dylan. You’re back?”<br>
<br>
“Hey Candice!” I greeted her happily.
“Yeah, just got back like 20
minutes ago. How’ve you been? Your mom said you were in some
kind of
trouble?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’m grounded…” She said.<br>
<br>
“Aww, really? Dang? For how long? Does that mean you
can’t hang out?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know for how long.” I could hear
the sadness in her voice. “My mom said I could still have
people over, but…”<br>
<br>
Suddenly there was a bit of scuffling noise, and then I heard her
little sister's voice telling me, “You've got to come over
quickly,
Dylan! You’ll never guess…!”<br>
<br>
I heard a bit more fighting, and some yelling by Candice at her sister,
before she came back on the line. “Sorry about
that.”<br>
<br>
“It’s alright. Say, I need to get unpacked, and
then I’ll head on over
to your house. It’ll only take me a few minutes to get
everything put
away.”<br>
<br>
“But Dylan…!”<br>
<br>
I interrupted her. I was too
excited to see her, I’ll admit. “Don’t
worry, I’ll be there in a
flash!” I said, hanging up the phone.<br>
<br>
I quickly dumped the
contents of my suitcase into one of my dresser drawers, and then headed
down the stairs and out the front door, calling to my mom as I left,
“I’m done unpacking! Goin’ to
Candice’s house!”<br>
<br>
“Be back for dinner!” She yelled back. She was used
to me heading out like that.<br>
<br>
I practically sprinted my way across the street. I know she was my
friend, but lately Candice had started to mature quite a bit. She was
no longer dressing like a kid, but more womanly. More feminine. It had
certainly ramped up my interest in spending time with her over the last
number of months. I couldn’t wait to see what she was wearing
today!<br>
<br>
Her little sister, Alexa, answered the door, seemingly wearing a
mischievous grin. She had the cuteness of Candice for sure, but not
quite the maturity, as the girl was still only 12. “Hi
Dylan!” She
almost seemed to be singing my name.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Dylan. What are you doing here?” Alexa and
Candice’s mom came over from the kitchen, giving me a
confused look.<br>
<br>
“Candice invited him over.” Alexa explained to her
mom. I guess if I
would have thought about it, Candice hadn’t really invited me
over. I
had sort of invited myself there, with Alexa being the one to suggest I
come.<br>
<br>
Her mom seemed to be accepting of what the little girl
had told her. “Really? I would have thought that…
Well, no matter.” She
turned back to addressing me. “Candice is up in her room.
Just
remember, don’t think you can take advantage of the
situation, just
because she is grounded!” She looked at me sternly, and for a
second I
thought I might be the one in trouble.<br>
<br>
At the time I just
thought she was making it clear that Candice couldn’t go
anywhere, so I
replied with, “I understand, Mrs. Simmons. Candice and I are
just going
to talk for a bit.”<br>
<br>
With that, Candice’s mom made a gesture
for me to come in, and I made the same climb up the stairs to her
bedroom I had made a hundred times before. “See, it
didn’t even take me
five minutes!” I said as I came in.<br>
<br>
Immediately I could tell
something was off. This was just about the most nervous I had ever seen
her. I don’t think she had even been this anxious about
giving a speech
in front of our class, or staring in the school play. It was weird too.
She had herself wrapped up in her comforter. The only thing she left
showing was her bare ankles and feet, and her head with her long brown
hair of course. Ok, so it was the middle of summer, and the AC was
blasting pretty hard. Maybe she was just cold?<br>
<br>
“Dyl…” She said, staring at me with wide
eyes.<br>
<br>
I’ll admit, I was totally oblivious to what she was actually
going
through at this point. “So, what happened? Why are you
grounded?”<br>
<br>
Candice gave me a totally mortified look, but before she could answer,
her sister interjected herself, “Hey!” She yelled
through the open
doorway from the hall, then turned to run downstairs,
“Candice is
wearing her blanket again, mom!!”<br>
<br>
“Candice!!” Her mom shouted from downstairs,
sounding completely furious. All I felt at that moment was confusion.<br>
<br>
“Dylan, please! Turn around!” Candice begged me in
a panic. I could see
tears welling in her eyes. I didn’t know why she was so upset
or so
afraid, but her request of me seemed reasonable enough, so I complied.
I was still not sure why she had asked me to turn away from her though.<br>
<br>
It hardly took any time for Candice’s mom to come stomping
into the
room. I could only see her out of my periphery, as I pretended to look
over the books on Candice’s bookshelf.<br>
<br>
“What did I tell you
would happen if you were caught wearing your blanket like that again,
young lady!!?” Wow, Candice’s mom was pissed! I
just tried to make
myself seem small, and debated about whether I should just try to sneak
my way out of the room. I didn’t dare turn around.<br>
<br>
“It’s back on the bed now,
mom…” It sounded like Candice was crying. Hearing
that broke my heart.<br>
<br>
“It’s too late for that young lady!!
You’ve lost all bedding privileges
now too!!” I heard a bit more stomping, and then after a bit,
I could
see Candice’s mom out of the corner of my eye. She was
holding all the
blankets and sheets from Candice’s bed in her arms.
“Dylan, you may as
well turn around and look now. Candice is in need of a real good lesson
on following directions.”<br>
<br>
I slowly turned myself around, first
seeing Mrs. Simmons, still holding the bed sheets. Then I think my
heart skipped at least a dozen beets. I was nowhere prepared for what I
saw! There in the far corner of the room stood Candice without a stitch
of clothing! I blink my eyes a few times to make sure I was seeing
straight, and I thought about pinching myself to make sure I
wasn’t
dreaming. Candice, cute as a button, girl next door beauty, pretty as
the day is long, my crush, Candice, was standing there totally, and
completely, NAKED!!!<br>
<br>
She had placed her arms and hands
strategically in front of herself, to cover her more special parts, but
there was still so much of her that I could see! I think the first
thing I noticed was her bare tummy. I had seen small hints of it
before, especially now that she was dressing more flatteringly. Now I
saw the full thing, and just how gorgeous and soft her skin there
seemed to be. My eyes were drawn downwards after that, to where her
hand was hiding whatever was hidden between her legs. I knew girls were
different, but at this point I had no idea what she could be preventing
me from seeing. I had no sisters, and my mom was always very private
with these things.<br>
<br>
Moving my eyes lower, I took in her bare,
shapely legs. I had seen this part of her before, for the most part at
least. This time there wasn’t any skirt or some denim jean
shorts
stopping me from seeing the rest of her sexy thighs. It was enticing to
see the shape of her waist and how her hips flared without any clothing
in the way as well.<br>
<br>
It was like I had tunnel vision at first.
But scanning back up her body, I could see she had goosebumps all over
her skin. Her arm was doing a poor job of blocking her bare boobs. I
could see the round shape of them both above and below that arm. I only
wished I could see her nipples then. Still, there was no denying that
at 15, she had grown quite a lot since we had first met, especially up
top. Her bare shoulders were the last part of her body I took in,
before our eyes met. I could see the absolute shame she was feeling,
and she quickly turned her eyes away from me, I guess so she
didn’t
have to see me looking at her naked.<br>
<br>
“Candice, you better
explain to your friend why you are naked, and just what you are in
trouble for.” I had forgotten her mom was standing there. I
sheepishly
looked over towards her, expecting for her to call me a pervert or
something, but she only gave another stern look towards her daughter,
before leaving the room.<br>
<br>
Candice had a little analog clock on
her nightstand, and the ticking sound it made, along with the blowing
of air though her vent, was the only noise in the room for a while. I
think neither of us were brave enough to say anything. I wish I could
tell you I had been a gentleman and looked away or something, but I
think I was in shock, so I just stared at her with my mouth open. It
was the most humiliated I had ever seen her in her life.<br>
<br>
“So, what happened?” Eventually I had to say
something. This silence was driving me crazy!<br>
<br>
“I screwed up, really badly.” She said in a small
voice. For this whole
time she had just been staring down at her bedroom floor. She had
looked up just a little when I spoke, but only for a second.
“I thought
I was being clever. I was supposed to do the laundry a few days ago.
There were four loads in total, but I guess I just wanted to get it
over and done with. I threw everything into the washer at once, and
jammed it all in there really tight and compact. Then I went to the
mall with Britney, leaving it running. When I got back, my parents
fricken lost it at me. I guess putting too many clothes in the washer
can break it… All the clothes inside were ruined too,
including most of
mine… The motor had shorted out, and caught everything inside
on fire…
I could have burned the whole house down…!” She
made a few sobs.<br>
<br>
“Oh my god…” I said, “At least
no one was hurt.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but Mittens and Colby were here… They could
have died!” Mittens
was her cat, and Colby the family dog. Her tears were flowing freely
now.<br>
<br>
I went over to grab her box of tissues, offering her one.
Neither of us even thought as she took it. But there they were! Her
boobs! I could see her nipples now, and they stood out from her boobs
quite a bit, like cute little wall pegs! I think it was just from the
AC, as I couldn’t imagine she was excited right now, since
she sat down
on the edge of her recently stripped bare mattress to cry. I tried
everything in my power to look away, but I tell you it was impossible!
They were like two pink bullseyes demanding the attention of my
eyeballs!<br>
<br>
Eventually her crying calmed a little, and just
turned into the sniffles. She finally looked up at me, catching me
staring at her. Seeing exactly what I was staring at! Oh of course now
I could look away! After she had caught me staring! Dammit!<br>
<br>
Thankfully, she didn’t seem to want to call me out about it,
but I
could see that her cheeks had turned red before she spoke.
“My parents
said, if I couldn’t handle the responsibility of doing the
laundry
correctly, then maybe I didn’t deserve the privilege of
wearing
clothes.” I was able to keep my eyes locked onto her face
this time,
thank god.<br>
<br>
“So they’re punishing you by making you stay
naked!?” I had never heard of anything like it. This had to
be some
kind of child abuse, or illegal right?<br>
<br>
She nodded. “I’m also
grounded, like I said. I can’t leave the house, not that I
want to go
anywhere like this anyway.” She gave almost a sneering laugh.
It was
the first bit of brightness I had seen in her mood since I had arrived.<br>
<br>
Maybe I could cheer her up a little? “Come on, you could
start the
latest fashion trend. I heard nude is all the rage in Europe these
days!”<br>
<br>
She gave a bit of a giggle. It was good to hear her laugh.
“Dylan…!” She said my name, almost
scolding me.<br>
<br>
My brain was finally starting to catch up to everything that had
happened. “Your sister really wanted me to come over here so
badly, so
I would see you… Like this?” I thought it best not
to directly mention
she was naked.<br>
<br>
“Yeah… She’s been teasing me about this
for the
last three days. She keeps asking my parents if she can invite her
friend Georgie over too…” She folded her arms,
giving a pout.<br>
<br>
Just then we heard a small giggle coming from the open doorway to
Candice’s room. Both Candice and I whipped our heads around,
just
catching Alexa peeking in at us, before she scampered away.<br>
<br>
I
turned back to Candice, who was now once again keeping her breasts
covered with her hands, one in each. She had her legs crossed now too,
meaning I couldn’t really see what she had in between. I did
see a bit
of short dark hair peeking out above her legs. Her face was totally
blushing again when I brought my attention back to her. I guess she
perceived me as checking her out… I mean I guess I sort of
was.<br>
<br>
“Dylan, my mom wants to know if you’re staying for
lunch?” My attention
was turned back towards the door, where Alexa stood, this time openly
letting her presence be known. She was giving us that mischievous
little smirk again.<br>
<br>
I looked back over at Candice, who just
shrugged her shoulders. “Umm… Sure. Just let me
text my mom to let her
know.” I explained to the younger girl, who began skipping
her way to
tell her mom that I had accepted the invitation.<br>
<br>
Things got a
lot more awkward between Candice and myself at this point. Not that it
hadn’t been going awkwardly already. Neither of us seemed to
know what
to say to one another anymore, and again there was a long silence
between us.<br>
<br>
“How was camp?” Candice was the one to break the
quiet this time.<br>
<br>
“Oh… Good. Good. We canoed. Made smores on the
campfire. There were a
lot of arts and crafts. Swimming. I even got to shoot a bow and
arrow!”
I said that last one, quite proudly and excitedly.<br>
<br>
“I wish I could have gone with you…” She
said sadly. She clearly meant so she wouldn’t have gotten
into trouble.<br>
<br>
“I thought you could never go because your parents rely on
you to babysit your sister while they are at work?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that’s true. I’m just thankful
that Alexa wasn’t home when this happened. She was over at a
friend's house.”<br>
<br>
“Hey, look at it this way. I’m sure
you’re never gonna make the same
mistake again in your life. Right?” I gave her a small smile,
trying to
ease her pain.<br>
<br>
“Yeah. You are right about that!” She actually
laughed a little. “I just wish my parents would tell me how
long I will
need to remain naked for.”<br>
<br>
“Your father and I have been
discussing that.” Her mom came back into the room
unannounced, making
both of us jump a little. “Lunch is ready.” She
explained. Then she
went and sat down on the bed next to Candice, and took one of her hands
to hold. I don’t think she realized just what she was doing!
Leaving
one of Candice’s beautiful bare boobs exposed to me!<br>
<br>
“I think a week is enough…”<br>
<br>
“A week!?” Candice complained, looking shocked at
her mother.<br>
<br>
“Yes, a week, young lady! Your father doesn’t seem
to agree though. He
thinks you should have to stay like this until you can afford to buy us
another washer.”<br>
<br>
“Oh my god…” Candice said, getting a
little pale. She looked over at me, I guess to see what my reaction
would be to that.<br>
<br>
“In either case, your father and I have decided that you are
no longer
responsible enough to be left on your own for the rest of summer
vacation. We both agreed it would be best to hire a babysitter for you
and your sister.”<br>
<br>
“A babysitter!?” Candice reacted in outrage, until
her mother gave her another long glare. “Ok… I
guess that’s fair.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly her mom turned to me. “Dylan, how would you like to
babysit Candice and Alexa for the rest of the
summer…?”</p>
