<h2>Chapter 1: I’m Naked?!</h2>

<p>Rebekah’s life was harder than that of most girls her age or even most students. Her parents’ divorce a year ago was the beginning of it all. The meeting was far from peaceful due to the potential NPD diagnosis of her parents. The sad reality was that they even attempted to use her to outdo each other, despite their personality disorder. Rebekah’s mother would make false accusations, even going as far as to claim that he assaulted her daughter. Her father would criticize her mother as being neglectful and immature, when in reality both of them were. Rebekah decided, that was it and decided to tell the judge everything that was happening, including how both of them had used her... </p>

<p>Through her argument, Rebekah was granted emancipation from her parents ... With the law requiring her to attend school, her parents gave her money to attend a good one. She was forced to attend school because of the law, and her parents were forced to provide her with money to attend a good one. <b>Sir Frederick Banting High School</b> was where she decided to enroll.</p>

<p>the institution itself had a stellar reputation and was named after a well-known doctor. Rebekah learned while in class that the cafeteria required a new dishwasher because the former one had graduated and left the school once he finished, which was 8 years after he started. Rebekah believed this would be ideal since she could use the money to complement what she already had and because she was aware of how her parents were and didn’t want to deal with them, she also knew that the money would eventually run out. She thus started working as a dishwasher, where she was employed around lunchtime after finishing her meal. Later, she obtained another position and joined the <b>Helpers Union</b>, a branch of a <b>Workers Union</b>.</p>

<p>Both would ultimately pay her a large sum of money, and the Helpers Union had other benefits, one of which was that charges were reduced in appreciation for some of the things they performed. Rebekah was aware of another way of being that also saves money, but she assumed she wouldn’t be using it. Instead, she believed that when the school contacted to inform her that she was enrolled in the program, she would have the chance to opt-out. After all, parents may choose to have their children not participate in the Naked in School Program, and because she became an adult when she emancipated herself, she was also able to do so.</p>

<p>She was summoned to the office on a Monday, which made her nervous because she was positive she hadn’t done anything wrong. She was also aware that she hadn’t gotten the call informing her of her potential involvement in the program. Rebekah proceeded to the office, informed the secretaries that she was there because she had been called down, and then awaited the Principal’s call to come in. When he finally did so, she discovered the Vice Principal, who had been joined by the Principal and the school’s attorney, Mr. Richard Moneylover. “Miss Elmstadter, welcome, and thank you for coming.” The vice principal said, appearing uneasy.</p>

<p>“I have a duty to let you know that you are in the program.” Rebecca blinking. Hold on!” I never received the call, Then, I would have informed you that I was declining. Rebekah said, feeling a bit irritated as her disbelief subsided. “Miss Elmstadter, unfortunately, won’t be able to take advantage of the opportunity owing to a recently implemented law.” said the attorney before continuing. While his parents had agreed that he would take part in all events, Minister Wilson found it annoying that he hadn’t been given the option of opting out. He declared the program to be a school activity and put into action a legislation that forbade parents from opting their children once they had already registered their children for school,” He added, raising his hand before she could respond.</p>

<p>He produced a recognized piece of paper that she had signed during the registration process for the school. “You did sign this, right?” Rebekah took a closer look at the document and saw her signature, which represented her pledge to take part in all extracurricular activities. “Y ... Yes I did, in fact, sign it.” Rebekah stated as her resentment toward herself for her mistake intensified.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, that means you’ll have to attend school naked for the rest of the week.” The lawyer said. “Additionally, due to an incident that occurred last week, your clothes will also need to be transported home in a box. Don’t worry, the service we employ is reputable. Rebekah recalled the incident in which a girl’s clothing were taken and lost. But she also recalled hearing that her older sister, the team’s basketball captain, had brought her along while they were going home or something.</p>

<p>But back to the main issue: They were expecting her to strip off before leaving the office, which she did. She then carefully tucked her clothing and panties into the box, which she observed being passed to another staff member. She returned to her class and concentrated on her work, recalling both her previous jobs and current dishwashing employment. She contacted her boss for her second job when she had a chance to leave the class for a bathroom break.</p>

<p>“Hello, this is Rebecca, Rebecca Elmstadter. I wanted to inform you ... I’m enrolled in the program, and under the new law, I was unable to withdraw.” She expressed her worry about the implications for her other work as she spoke. “Okay, I’ll mark you for that so that if possible, people who said that they were unconcerned by nudity that way, you can continue to work. That is, if you plan to remain undressed after school.” Her boss responded and asked a question to end his speech. Rebekah said before her supervisor could reply, “They’ve sent my clothes home, so I’ll probably need to be until work is done.” He ended the call by saying, “I understand Have a good day.”</p>

<p>“Ok ... Making sure my other employer is aware is the second order of business.” As she walked to the cafeteria, which was conveniently located on the route to her class, Rebekah said. The teenager entered through the door and circled the counter and railing. As she moved by and approached the kitchen, where she almost collided with her supervisor, the head of the lunch ladies, whose reflection in the cafeteria showed her nude body. Miss Agnes Wilson, a kind lady, exclaimed, “Oh!” as she almost collided with her. “Sorry!” Rebekah said, not wanting to make her fall if that were to happen.</p>

<p>As Agnes took a close look at her, Rebekah added, “I wanted to let you know ... I’m in the program. However, I am concerned about what to do with my job.” Agnes nodded in understanding as Rebekah added, “Yes, I do see the problem, and based on the announcement, I had a feeling that you could have been, but I wasn’t sure. In any event, they’ll let you know when you’re done eating since I believe that the others and i have something worked out about that.” Rebekah was let go so she could go back to class after the elder woman said.</p>

<p>Rebekah attempted to concentrate on her work while in class, but her curiosity kept her from finishing it in time for the bell to ring.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time</b></p>

<p>As she sat with the other Program Participants, Rebekah remained mute. The other diners at the table discussed laws and demands that were no longer considered acceptable because they were made on behalf of some people. A hot dog and some fries that Agnes had graciously left for her made up her meal. Rebekah recalled Agnes leaving her a sandwich for her to eat yesterday. She was always taken care of by Agnes, a compassionate woman who also assisted her with her résumé and helped her land the dishwashing job. She had made Rebekah feel grateful, which motivated her to give her all in her job.</p>

<p>After passing the rest of the fries to the group, she got up from the table and made her way to the kitchen, where she rejoined the other women, carrying her backpack. “Oh!” Jody Belcova said, letting her gaze to drift to the teen’s privates, “Agnes informed us you’d be nude.” The woman said, “Hmm.” As she led the naked adolescent to where the coat racks were, she remarked, “You don’t look like you have too much hair down there, but...” Jody handed her what looked like a pair of underwear and added, “To be on the safe side, we decided you should wear this, in addition to your hairnet and apron.”</p>

<p>Rebekah saw as she held it that it resembled the hairnet in terms of feel and texture. Although she was aware that this was done to stop pubic hair from coming off and touching the meal, she was unsure of how it might be done. Instead, the youngster went to the bathroom, sat at the toilet, and then stood after sticking her legs through the openings in the “hairnet panties.” The string was felt between her butt cheeks as she drew it up and adjusted it over her privates.</p>

<p>Before putting on the second hairnet and the apron, she took a quick look in the mirror. She thought to herself, “Huh ... This kind of makes me think of that movie, Compliance,” and put the rest of the apron and her hair net on. She headed to her station after exiting the restroom. Where she saw a rack and dragged the now-warm rack with the trays of freshly cleaned dishes to the end of the rail so one of the women could take them.</p>

<p>After setting up a different rack, Rebekah entered the cafeteria and proceeded to the larger metal rack holding the filthy trays. She then carried the dirty trays back into the kitchen and quietly started placing them on the rack.</p>

<p>Rebekkah considered the fact that, while working, she was essentially wearing a thong, which was unusual to see in a high school in the middle of the day. She was confident that the hairnet panties she was wearing were noticeable when she returned to her workplace in the kitchen. She continued working since she reasoned that her fellow pupils weren’t paying attention to her. The kid had to admit that she felt glad there were no bullies at her school.</p>

<p>She moved back and forth during the Lunch Hour, taking a rack, loading trays and dishes onto it, then running the racks through the washing machine. She then took hold of one of the pointless racks and began to arrange the utensils on them before pushing them toward the machine so that it would catch them. Later, though, she realized that a tray was jutting out the incorrect direction, so she hit the machine’s stop button and raised its side to get access.</p>

<p>As the machine’s hot steam began to escape, she took a step back. Then, she inserted her hands inside, moved the rack so that it fit, closed the lid, and switched the machine back on. She observed the rack carrying the just realigned rack pass through and come out the other side. “There we go,” she thought to herself before turning around once again and making her way back into the cafeteria.</p>

<p>The teenage girl couldn’t help but think that she was grateful the principals had made her strip off at this particular day because it was warm and not likely to make the cafeteria cold. She thought this as she walked back to where the trays and dishes were dropped.</p>

<p>She noticed the decreasing number of students on her next walk outside to get the trays and was reminded of why she enjoyed working at this time of year. this was due to the fact that it was easier. Her work at that time was much shorter due to the student’s desire to be outside and the change in clothing—or lack thereof, in her case. She had to confess that was one benefit of warmer weather that she enjoyed.</p>

<p>Standing once more next to the machine, she felt an itch because the material of the apron and the other hairnet panties was causing some minor discomfort. She scratched the itch on her belly by slipping her hand under the apron, and then she snuck it under the other hairnet panties before returning to her work.</p>

<p>Rebekah continued to work in the hot and cold environment of the kitchens and the cafeteria and thought to herself, “Might be eating well tonight, not sure if I want to be excited or concerned about that.” She thought to herself, then “I mean, being nude reduces money, and joining the Helpers Union reduces money. Then there’s the possibility of getting money off if I wind up somewhere where they truly prefer having women in their establishment. I’ll essentially be eating for free after all this.” As she carried on with her work, she added.</p>

<p>There were only three trays left in the tray return rack when she arrived, and she noticed that the cafeteria seating area was empty. This gave her a reason to smile as she stacked the three trays, brought them back into the kitchen, set them up in the racks, and gently pushed them into the machine. She then moved to the opposite side and watched as they emerged. She turned and headed to her backpack as soon as the trays had exited the machine without the trays being stuck, at which point she took off her apron and put it up on her hanger. She took off both hairnets and put them in their respective spots in the bag after hanging her apron.</p>

<p>Rebekah walked to the restroom to wipe down her privates because she knew she didn’t need to be there anymore. She then went back to her bag and brought it with her as she proceeded to locate her boss. Her boss had already shut the register and was approaching the naked teenager with a tiny envelope containing her money. Rebekah responded, “Thanks,” as she put the envelope in her backpack and headed back to class.</p>

<p>Even though the lessons were challenging, she was relieved when they were finished since she knew her other job will be waiting for her. She anticipated receiving a call as soon as her mobile phone’s timer hit 3:30 p.m. This would be from a client who wanted her assistance, however it may also be a telemarketer seeking to sell. Those were the most obnoxious calls, but presumably all mobile phone owners had to put up with them.</p>

<p><b>After School, Off to Work</b></p>

<p>After her final lesson, Rebekah ran to her locker while slipping her hand inside her bag in order to get her phone, which had already started to vibrate mechanically. She had reached her locker when she clicked the green accept button and immediately started looking for a notebook. She spoke into the speakers, into what she had been referring to as the Ether, “Hello?” Rebekah had a suspicion when the returning voice made a little groan that wasn’t indicative of sex but rather agony.” I’m sorry, but are you a member of the Helpers Union?” She heard a familiar voice ask, “Did I do that right?”</p>

<p>The voice of the lady stated “Yes, ma’am, I am a member of the Helpers Union, you did it perfectly,” Rebekah replied. Rebekah grinned as she heard what appeared to be the other woman joyfully exclaiming “Yes.”</p>

<p>She introduced herself as Alexandra Blaskowitz and added, “I got into a little bit of an accident the other day and shouldn’t be moving, but I need to go to the Galley, a grocery store, and get some food.” Rebekah recognized the name as she spoke. “Okay, I can do that. Rebekah said, “What food do you need, Ma’am?” as she prepared her pencil to record her client’s order. She then shifted her focus to that.</p>

<p>It’s okay if you get the box with the chicken and turkey, connected, but I need eggs and ham.” Alexandra added a few more things to the list before ending it with Mister Cheeze’s Cheeze, another item she was familiar with, lastly, she was running low on milk. Rebekah responded, “Okay, I got the list, and I will head to the Galley, and I’ll need your address, ma’am.” Rebekah said before Alexandra revealed her address.” I live in the Rupera Apartments, so, um.” She then understood why the voice and name of the woman were so familiar.</p>

<p>Oh, I see why you sounded familiar now, the apartments on Fox Avenue! We’re neighbors; my name is Rebecca Elmstadter and I live in apartment 6C,” she said, grinning at the woman’s reply. She recalled how and why her neighbor had been injured. She slipped in the bathtub and hurt her back and legs, which is a severe injury for someone of her seniority.</p>

<p>Rebekah concluded the conversation by saying, “Okay Alexandra, I’ll head right for the Galley, and will see you in ... A Half an Hour.” As per corporate rules, Alexandra’s app will identify her as the assistant allocated to her as a client of hers. This indicated that Rebekah would not receive any further calls until she had finished assisting Alexandra. Rebekah reasoned that she could leave her bag in her apartment after delivering Alexandra’s meal order and return to work if she got another call.</p>

<p>Using the GPS software on her phone, Rebekah moved to the rear doors. “Hmm, it appears that the Galley is on the opposite side of town, a little past downtown as well. This means that I will be exposed to the sun for most of the trip, which is bad for a nude girl like me. However, it means I’ll have to spend money on cream that will protect me from sunburn. Fortunately, I know one of the greatest locations to go for that,” Rebekah thought to herself as she went outside into the student parking lot’s sunny parking lot. She mostly kept to herself, waving to those she knew and making her way to where her bike was chained.</p>

<p>Her bike was unique since it had the same height as a typical bike but was constructed like a tricycle at the back. Her backpack and any other goods, such as any artwork she needed to bring home, were locked in a box that she could lock, open, and close above the back wheels. She took her backpack off of her shoulder, unlocked the box, and opened it. She then placed it inside, closed the box.</p>

<p>She removed her bike’s chain and put it in a box before mounting her bike and noting on how strange it felt to be riding it while naked. But she swiftly moved past it as she turned around and rode her bike out of the parking lot. As she approached the well-known tiny strip of shops, she continued to ride her bike, but reduced her pedaling to let the bike cruise. These shops were placed on the dividing line between her high school and the next high school. She made a right turn onto the parking lot’s access road and continued cycling until she arrived at the final store. Here, she used the brakes to slow down the bike before getting off and locking it to prevent theft.</p>

<p>She hurried to her bag in the box and took her cash out, then quickly ran to the door and opened it only to be greeted with the chilly air. There is no doubt that the store’s air conditioning kept the warmth from the outside from entering. But Rebekah needed to do her work, and she didn’t want to put it off. She entered the store and strolled casually toward the aisle where she was certain the cream she required was located.</p>

<p>She picked up a bottle, took a quick look at it, and then frowned a bit. Because the bottle was so little, she wasn’t sure whether she could cover her entire body with it, so she grabbed two before heading to the register to pay. Would this cover me, hey? She questioned the cashier while seeing him consider it. He remarked, shifting his attention away from the bottle towards her breasts rather than her face, saying, “You’ll probably waste your money since it will take the whole bottle to cover you completely.”</p>

<p>Rebekah would typically become furious if someone simply stared at her chest while speaking to her, but there were times when she spoke with someone who was autistic, like the man before her. She stayed composed since she was aware that people on the autism spectrum couldn’t look people in the face. After all, it wasn’t like looking at her breasts could cause an infection or cancer.</p>

<p>Just as the door behind the counter opened, Rebekah turned to look at the bottles. Rebekah saw a family similarity between the woman who entered and the man who was standing before her. “Ooh, pretty naked girl!” As she got closer, the woman made a remark. “Ah, the sunburn cream, good to know. Since you are one of my favorite customers, we’ll offer you the bottles without charge, and we’ll order the jumbo-sized bottle for your usage, kay?” She asked.</p>

<p>Rebecca considered that to be fair. She opened a bottle and stated vocally, “OK, sure, thanks,” for the benefit of the two shop owners.</p>

<p>Rebekah chatted to the two while squeezing a small amount of the cream out and applied it to her skin. “Since I’m going to the Galley, I definitely need this, since I don’t have an immunity to sunburns after all.” The lady nodded as the man returned to his job replied, that “no one was immune to sunburns.” Rebekah had heard him say it but didn’t respond, The lady stepped around the desk and started to help Rebekah by rubbing the lotion on her back. This allowed her to stop struggling to get the cream on her back. She quickly discovered that the first bottle was empty, thus she had, regrettably, been correct to acquire another bottle.</p>

<p>Before beginning on her legs, she completed applying the cream to her breast, then moved on to her belly. She reached for her privates when she heard a gasp, which made her look up and saw the woman was interested in what she was touching at the time and staring directly at her.</p>

<p>Because she needed to focus, she didn’t think anything of it, and soon the long-lasting sunburn resistant lotion was applied to every inch of her body. She picked up the bottles since she didn’t want to be impolite because they had given them to her for free. Her eyes caught a glimpse of lettering on the bottle’s side as she was doing this. The physicians’ statement explained that while the cream protected sunburns as sunscreen does, it also enabled the excellent things the sun causes to occur.</p>

<p>Rebekah was reminded of what she had previously studied in a health lesson she had taken. The doctor had explained to the students that the 7-DHC protein, which is present to generate vitamin D3, interacts with UVB rays when they strike human skin. She recalled how intrigued she had been to discover this and realized why she was okay with being exposed outside. Knowing she would be getting vitamin D from riding after she left the store made her happy. Even though she couldn’t recall what each vitamin performed, she was nevertheless aware of its great effects.</p>

<p>She waved farewell to them as she turned and walked toward the door, allowing those behind to view her butt since she needed to get back to riding. The risk of getting burned was no longer a concern, but the teenager had a surge of exhilaration as she considered what the sun may do for her now. She hopped onto her bike after unlocking it, but she slipped a little due to friction from the cream she had applied to her body. She regained her balance and checked to make sure she wouldn’t slip any more before starting to back up to remove her from the store’s parking lot before turning the bike and heading back out onto the road.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>She adjusted the bike helmet at the first red light, making sure it was snug, then pedaled forward when the light went green. Because she didn’t want to get into an accident, the teenager rode her bike while keeping an eye on the posted speed limit. For starters, she would be dismissed if she caused an accident since it would damage the Helpers Union’s reputation. She attended a high school as well, thus she ran the risk of being expelled.</p>

<p>If there was one thing her ex-parents got right, it was that they made an effort to instill a respect for the law in her. She tried to be good since she believed they didn’t want her to have any issues with the police. The teenager believed that was why she initially joined the Helpers Union as she rode her bike closer and closer to the downtown center. When she saw that her thoughts were drifting to her parents, she tried to shift her attention to something else. Her parents had always made her angry.</p>

<p>She became even more irritated when there was another red light, especially considering how long it would take her to go to the Galley, before making it to her client, and her neighbor. Vehicles positioned themselves on either side of her. She was able to recognize what they were without even looking since she could smell the gas that their vehicles ran on. While she waited, she had a look about and was able to see inside the vehicles on each side of her. An additional vehicle moved into position behind her, and she realized that her butt was in plain sight.</p>

<p>As other vehicles moved into position behind her, she could feel her butt being seen clearly. She made no attempt to conceal herself, though, because a bike like hers made it useless to do so. She concentrated on the task at hand and ignored the derogatory remarks about her behind that were being made behind her. Fortunately, the light changed to green, and she rode away, using Backroads just in case. She resumed riding after realizing they either couldn’t or wouldn’t follow her.</p>

<p>“Let’s see ... Need to take that road, Yoda Street, which gets me into the middle of downtown, then I’ll take Hercules Avenue west, and then Musk, and I am there.” She murmured while she concentrated on remembering her way. She was familiar with the area because she had previously visited the Galley and other nearby locations on prior travels.</p>

<p>She pondered if she might have made a living as a cab driver as she pedaled her bicycle to her destination. She was aware that they need locational knowledge in order to transport their passengers. Though she giggled a bit to herself at the idea of driving a cab, she enjoyed the work she was doing just now.</p>

<p>Rebekah murmured to herself, “And there it is,” as she saw the enormous superstore in front of her. She reduced the speed at which she pedaled so that she could move into the parking lot. As she made her way to the bike racks, the teenager observed several vehicles, trucks, and vans. As she approached, she dismounted her bike and continued on foot.</p>

<p>Rebekah walked up to the bike rack, secured her bike, and retrieved her shopping list from her backpack. She took her purse and set the list inside before putting the straps over her shoulder because she was naked and had no pockets of her own. She closed the box and locked it and headed to the cart station with her bag on her arm. She pulled back on the cart, freeing it from the chain, after she shoved a coin into the slot. Now that the Cart was free, she pointed it at the doors and turned it around, concentrating on her task. She was aware that she would be traveling somewhere new while naked.</p>

<p>She was aware that this would be something new for her, but she was certain that she could do it. Around the corner from the entrance were the entrance to the parking lot and the bike rack. Customers were somewhat startled when she abruptly appeared and entered the location. As she moved toward the aisles, where she knew Alexandra’s requests were, the customers inside were treated to an unexpected sight. The people surrounding her were astonished by how young she seemed, not by her nudity.</p>

<p>“Can’t get it just yet,” she told herself. She said, “It will spoil soon,” as she passed the milk aisle, which she saw was just next to the ice cream section of the supermarket. She did, however, open the door and reached inside for the cheese that Alexandra was requesting. She remarked to herself, diplomatically, “Mister Cheeze’s Cheese is one of the best out there.” She believed it was the finest and didn’t think it was one of the best. Unlike the cheese she and Alexandra like, the other cheese had an unusual flavor.</p>

<p>She placed the cheese on the section of the cart that typically holds babies with care. She had room there because she didn’t have a baby with her. When she closed the door after detecting the cold from the open door, her body adjusted the temperature inside and outside the refrigerator. She didn’t want to linger, so she delicately bent her list so that the cheese was no longer visible on it, and she walked away. Rebekah thought to herself, “Wonder if Alexandra will mind if I cook for her,” as she recalled her client and neighbor mentioning she’d gotten hurt. As she moved into the meat department, she grinned at the thought. Her ideas evolved into what type of supper, she may be able to prepare for her neighbor, and by the time she reached the meat department, she was certain of the specific recipe.</p>

<p>She took a package of three different meat kinds from behind the meat counter after opening the door. Then the ribs, which she added to her cart after turning the list like she had done with the cheese. In order to hide the word meats, this was done. “Okay, simply some eggs and milk and i am done.” Rebekah thought to herself as her mood improved. She started to go, but had to halt suddenly when she nearly hit a man. “I am sorry about that. I was concentrating more on my to-do list than where I was going. The man said nothing in return but appeared astonished at the nude teenager.</p>

<p>She simply went away and into the store’s egg area after she was convinced he wouldn’t reply. She saw more and more individuals reacting to her as she proceeded until she spotted a familiar figure. She called out to the adult male, “Hiya Tim!” While his brain processed what he was seeing, he waved even though he knew who she was. “Hey Rebekah, are you going to get something to eat for yourself or for your clients?” Tim knew not to question who her client was as that was a private matter and she responded with “my client”. He responded, “Well, you know where everything is, so I’ll let you go,” and he strode away.</p>

<p>“Hey, did I hear that correctly? You are familiar with the layout of this store?” She turned as a man’s voice rang out behind her. He had a bit of a belly, a forties-looking appearance, and evidence of frequent alcohol use. Although she recognized the expression as coming from her parents, she could tell he wasn’t intoxicated at the time by the way he was speaking. She just said, “Yeah,” adding, “I come here a lot for work so I am very familiar with the Galley.” He replied with “awesome We’re looking for ice cream,.”</p>

<p>She replied, “Ah, I’m going in that direction, so you can follow me,” and he grinned broadly and turned his head for a second. “Hey guys I’ve got a charming lady who will lead us to the ice cream.” When he called, a party of seven men showed up right away. all were all different from one another in terms of looks and ethnicity, but all shared the same type of belly as the first man.</p>

<p>Before she started guiding the men toward the ice cream aisle, Rebekah was almost overwhelmed as she greeted each of them. “Our boy here got promoted at work, so we’re celebrating with ice cream, but we each like a different kind so we gotta get different kinds of ice cream,” remarked male 2. “Congrats on the promotion! That’s awesome.” She informed the man who had been shown that he was promoted. She then turned and started pointing the way to the ice cream after that.</p>

<p>She heard whispers behind her that she immediately recognized as being about her, how young she was, and how naked she was. She noticed a handful of them glancing at her butt as they passed a reflecting surface, which made her question why men are so fascinated by women’s butts. She didn’t understand why guys favored them so much, but she assumed it was a weird male trait.</p>

<p>She led the men down an aisle, where she knew there was ice cream, before turning around and she spoke. “Just so you’re aware, I can hear you, and I’m in high school,” to their gasps and noticed their embarrassed expressions from a different reflected surface. She gave a childish smile at the sight of the men being caught. But when they found out she was in high school, she noticed a difference in their demeanor. The men appeared more polite and stopped gazing at her butt. She acknowledged it and made the decision to overlook their stare.</p>

<p>They arrived at the ice cream aisle quickly. When Rebekah turned to look, she noticed a whole wall filled with numerous flavors of ice cream, ranging from fruit popsicles to vanilla and chocolate. Rebekah could also make out ice cream pails, including vanilla, chocolate, and others. Her time with them was coming to an end when she noticed the men spreading out to choose their ice cream. As soon as she responded, “Okay, I’ve got to go finish my shopping, so enjoy your ice cream!” she saw them waving and heard them saying good-bye.</p>

<p>As she moved toward the eggs, she turned back to her cart and pushed it. She passed the milk while moving, but since she was concerned about running out of time, she made the choice to return to retrieve the eggs first. The girl, amazed by the surprised customers’ reactions to her bare body, waved and grinned as they passed her. The mall was the most obvious location, but the kid knew they were astonished because teenagers seldom ever went there while unclothed.</p>

<p>She was also aware that her presence was solely related to her job. She was going to provide food to her client since she was injured. She said to herself, “Ah, there are the eggs,” and as she looked, she noticed that there were many types of eggs, each with a unique eggshell and yolk within. But because she was aware of the chosen eggs for her neighbor, she gently took the egg carton and added the eggs to her cart. Because the milk came next, the teen made room.</p>

<p>She now paid little attention to the glances she’d received from the customers as she moved to where the milk was, concentrating instead on doing her task. She slowed down just enough to place the milk jug in her cart after removing it from the store’s refrigerator. “Okay, everything is finished; I just need to go pay for everything, and then it’s time to go home.” She voiced her happiness at having completed her work.</p>

<p>Rebekah moved past the men who were chatting in the aisle about various subjects. She was confident they were aware that ice cream melts, so she didn’t feel the need to speak as she walked away and toward the cashiers. However, she walked to the self-serve register and paid for the meal ingredients after seeing that most of the cashiers had huge lines.</p>

<p>She put her groceries in bags while using her membership card for the Helper’s Union and her outreach card, and she whistled softly when she realized how little she had to spend. The cart was then carefully wheeled outside the doors to the area where she kept her bike, opened the box, and started loading the contents carefully while making sure her backpack was out of the way.</p>

<p>Before starting to ride off, she unfastened the bike lock and placed it inside the box after closing it and making sure it was secure. The teenager was aware that the best way to return to her apartment, which was near to the school, was to take the opposite path but travel one street farther. However, she discovered that there were two semi-trucks on either side of her at the first red light.</p>

<p>She didn’t pay attention to their stares, but she considered what it may be like to drive a truck. She decided that when she had her learner’s permit the next year and her driver’s license the following year, she would trade in her bike for a truck. A truck had to be the most practical vehicle she had ever seen, and because there was such a thing as “Van life,” truckers must also experience something akin.</p>

<p>She noticed that it was getting close to five on the enormous clock as she passed the Town Center, which made her recall the plan she had for preparing for her neighbor. She reasoned that she could accomplish that and then go eat supper on her own in her apartment.</p>

<p>As she walked along the well-known roadway that led to her high school and the nearby school. When she considered finishing her tasks successfully, she felt herself grinning. Though she hadn’t yet arrived at her apartment, she understood that it was premature. However, she was aware that by utilizing the school as a landmark, she was really close to her house. She noticed Walter leave as she walked up and immediately recognized him as a decent man who looked out for the welfare of the building’s residents.</p>

<p>She also understood that he would place their mailbox with any items that arrived. She was certain that large products, like TVs, could fit in these significant holes in the wall. But she had her doubts about anything larger.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Walter!” As she approached her preferred bike parking area, she greeted and got off her bike before locking it. “Hello Miss Elmstadter, a parcel has arrived for you, and are you naked right now?” As soon as he finally got a glimpse of her body, he questioned her. “Yes, I have been admitted in the program at the school that I must attend. Most likely, the package contains my clothes, and it is delivered home as a precaution against theft. Fortunately, I have the finest guardian for my home here to keep it secure.” As she walked to the box and the rear of her bike, Rebekah stated with a smile.</p>

<p>She had praised him, causing Walter to blush, and he was about to turn around when she called to him. He turned back with a nod as she asked, “Wait, a sec, could you do me a favor?” “Sure,” he said as he got closer. She took out her bag and gave it to him. “I have some deliveries to make to Alexandra upstairs.” She requested him, “Could you take my bag and put it in my box?” She observed his nod. “Yes, and if you’d want I could also push a button to send it up.” As she nodded in agreement, he stated while holding her bag and proceeded inside.</p>

<p>Before starting to walk to the doors that Walter and another guy gently kept open for her, Rebekah took the bags and utilized an ingenious way to hold them all in her arms without dropping them. The elevator’s floor button was subsequently pressed by the other man. She could thus simply stand there holding the bags close to her naked body. Prior to the entrance doors opening and her entry.</p>

<p>She noticed the strange sensations as she ascended, but she also noticed that it felt familiar to when she had only been wearing a bikini. She started to get ready to go when it opened after catching a glimpse of the number change with her eyes. The teenager passed her neighbor on the way out, barely brushing against them with her elbow and hip. She turned as she approached the door and took a step back before pressing a button with her butt. There were two buttons at the doorway that could be pressed to let people inside know there were people there. One stood at a typical citizen’s height, the other shorter.</p>

<p>She turned back and used her butt to hit the bottom button because her hands were full. Eventually, the doors opened and she was able to enter. “Alexandra, I made it!” Rebekah said as she hurried to the kitchen in front of her. “I’m delighted you made it, and I appreciate your assistance with this.” As she made a call from her room, Alexandra spoke. “I always want to help, therefore I have the ideal work, no problem.” Rebecca returned the call. Before she started, she said, “By the way, how is your pain?” Rebekah asked of her.</p>

<p>Rebekah unlocked the fridge and put the cheese, meat, milk, and eggs inside. As Alexandra replied, “Still quite sore, I can barely stand, and it hurts to move.” The teen removed the nearly empty egg carton for the eggs, positioned the fresh egg carton underneath it, and then put the eggs back in. “Oh, I was thinking about that, so I came up with an idea for a little extra help, but you don’t have to pay for it. What if I prepared food for you?” As she began to load the freezer and refrigerator with items, Rebekah questioned her.</p>

<p>“W what? Even if you won’t be paid, you would be willing to cook for me?” Alexandra’s shocked voice then rang out. “Yes, I’m willing,” Rebekah said. Rebekah raced into her neighbor’s bedroom out of worry for her safety when the next sound was a loud groan of pain. “Are you alright?” Rebekah inquired as she went to check on her neighbor in an anxious manner.</p>

<p>Rebekah raced to her side and saw her neighbor struggling to get out of bed. Before realizing Rebekah was naked, Alexandra added, “I wanted to get up, at least do something in thanks for your willingness to cook for me.” Alexandra pointed out the obvious as Rebekah considered how she may be of help, “Uh, you’re naked,” she added. “You don’t need to do anything, and I don’t want to make your sorrow worse,” Rebekah said. “And yeah, my school forced me to be in the program,” she added.</p>

<p>Then Alexandra said to her visitor, “OK, how about ... Eat supper with me, please? You’re cooking for me, which is kind of you, but I’d like to share with you and, to be honest, it would feel weird if I didn’t at least participate in the cooking. At this pace, you’d also be eating supper late, which I wouldn’t enjoy,” Alexandra replied, making Rebekah grin. “Sure, we could do that, provided there won’t be any issues.” Alexandra grinned at her bare feet. “This shouldn’t be. Oh, maybe there could be something in the box; I saw a shipment for me arrive. It’s meant to make it easier for me to eat at the table. So, if it is the special cushion, you can open it.” Rebekah nodded as she continued as she turned and left her neighbor’s bedroom.</p>

<p>As it was the same for her apartment, she was aware of where every parcel went as it was delivered up. She took the box after lifting the sliding door and verifying that it had everything Alexandra needed. Rebekah gently withdrew the cushion from the box at Alexandra’s request, checked it in her hand, then proceeded to the table and set it on the seat closest to the bedroom door. Because she didn’t want Alexandra to move too much, she decided that place was the best. Once that was finished, she went back to the kitchen and got to work making a supper for herself and Alexandra.</p>

<p>She eventually heard Alexandra calling out to her. “Rebekah, I smell something good there!” When Rebekah heard this, she grinned and called back. “I hope it tastes good because I excelled in the culinary portion of Home EC last year.” Rebekah spoke with pride in her voice. She was happy to have high grades since it gave her confidence, made her believe she could work in a restaurant, and made her wonder if she might start preparing meals in the school kitchen.</p>

<p>As she was finishing up a dinner, she thought about registering for the Commercial Cooking Class the next year. But the school would make that decision, not her. Before going back to Alexandra’s side, she laid the dishes with the food and drink. She looked at her bed and stated, “Food is ready,” while she pondered how Alexandra could be helped out of it.</p>

<p>As soon as she had an idea, she acted on it by cautiously getting onto bed with Alexandra. She then quietly reached out for several pillows, pulled them closer, and gently pushed them so that Alexandra could use them as levitation. After assisting her out of the bed, Rebekah stepped in her path so that Alexandra could lean against her and away from the hurt area of her body. Alexandra was taken aback by Rebekah’s antics, but she remained silent as she watched her and grinned as she managed to get out of bed.</p>

<p>The two proceeded to the kitchen and Rebekah got Alexandra seated there together. “How about that?” Hoping she had done well, Rebecca questioned her. “Thanks for your help, and please sit down,” Alexandra said with a grin. “Oh, and don’t forget the towel—it belongs in that closet.” Rebekah went to the closet, took out a towel, and came back, as Alexandra pointed out.</p>

<p>Together, they consumed their meals, and while Rebekah flushed throughout, she overheard Alexandra complimenting her cuisine and expressing her gratitude for having such a talented cook prepare it for her. Rebekah was pleased with herself after learning that Alexandra had handled the app, given her a good rating, and written positive comments about her in the app.</p>

<p>While Rebekah’s job for her may be finished, she advised Alexandra to call her personally if she needed assistance. Rebekah also added her phone number to Alexandra’s contacts. Rebekah didn’t want to leave Alexandra hanging if she needed assistance that would take another team member too long to provide, and she didn’t have any plans to go out anymore now that she was off duty.</p>

<p>Following dinner, the two exchanged goodbye hugs before Rebekah left for her apartment. She habitually exclaimed, “I’m home!” even though no one was waiting for her in her apartment. She quickly turned to her mailbox and opened it before removing her bag and placing it on the table, followed by the box containing her clothes.</p>

<p>Before placing her clothing in the hamper, she gave it a whiff. She then walked to her backpack and took out her homework. “Okay, I think I should take a shower so that I can finish my homework before going to bed,” she thought to herself as she walked to the bathroom and had a shower, wiping off the perspiration and the sunburn prevention cream before going back to her table and returning in a towel.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Nudist and the Patients</h2>

<p>Rebekah would spend, the second day of the week, completely naked. For the teenager, everything has gone smoothly. In school or outside of it, no one had attempted to be sexually offensive to her. She managed to visit a business like the Galley yesterday without suffering any consequences despite shocking her neighbor, client, and customers with her nudity. Due to changes in the laws, public nudity is now acceptable. She hadn’t been forbidden from visiting a business like the Galley yesterday as a result. Rebekah, on the other hand, intended to profit fully from the cost-cutting measures that would be available to her. The teenager could now taste the pricey dishes from the upscale restaurants.</p>

<p>But first, she had to concentrate on her day, which began with waking up, getting ready, and eating breakfast before traveling to high school. Rebekah had to ride her bike to school in the darkness due to the time that school started, which was unfortunate. Something that would have been hazardous if her bike hadn’t been outfitted with powerful lights along the back, the box, and the front that would make it and her visible.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this meant that she wouldn’t need to worry about any mishaps. Additionally, because of the way she was now required to dress for school, she didn’t need to worry about concerns for intoxicated people. The little strip mall fortunately didn’t sell alcohol, so there wouldn’t be any drunks staggering out of there on their way home.</p>

<p>As she approached the school, She had observed other students arriving at the school and parents dropping off their kids. When the teenager saw the captain of the girls basketball team waiting for friends at the entrance, she had the opportunity to approach her for an autograph, but she refrained due to her lack of excitement for sports. There was nothing for her to sign and she didn’t have time for it. And though she had heard rumors about the captain, but she didn’t really believe them.</p>

<p>She was overcome with loneliness as she walked into the student parking lot. Unfortunately, she was unable to socialize with others due to her busy schedules at her dishwashing job and Helpers Union employment. However, as she pulled into her favorite parking spot, she began to recall the group of program members she had lunch with. She walked to the box, took out her bag and bike lock, and then went back to the front of her bike and fastened it to the bike rack as she continued to think.</p>

<p>She encountered a bright light that attacked her face and body upon entering the school after locking her bike. Trying to adjust to the bright light, she squinted and walked towards her class with her backpack ... The table of naked students kept coming to her mind, and she realized they were good people who accepted her as part of their support system.</p>

<p>She realized how appreciative she was of the table for allowing her to join them there as she gave it more attention. She felt more secure sitting with the group than by herself. The program’s information pages advised against solitary seating. Although she was aware that sitting alone was not very secure, she had seen the week before that the gathering was smaller than usual. The majority of the program participants had sat elsewhere, either outside or in the cafeteria.</p>

<p>While in class, Rebekah paid close attention but also paid little heed to the classmates attempting to grab her attention. Because she didn’t know how exhausted she would be after her second job, she wanted to concentrate so that she wouldn’t have as much homework tonight. Though she knew that wasn’t always the case, she was relieved that the task from yesterday wasn’t too difficult.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time</b></p>

<p>On Tuesday during lunch, Rebekah sat at the participant’s table and remained mute. They discussed several demands they had to endure, which was a departure from yesterday’s conversation. When she eventually spoke and described the requirements she had to fulfill, she stunned them. She described how she had to force another kid who was kneeling to have a “kiss” on his cheeks with the “lips” of her crotch. Although she thought it was a rather bizarre request, she had no choice but to complete the mission because they weren’t penetrating her.</p>

<p>“You made sure they at least washed their cheek, right?,” A girl asked her across from her. Before she spoke, Rebekah nodded. “Yeah, I’ve heard a few grumblings though. However, I don’t anticipate any issues with the vice principal and principal. As she returned to her meal, she told them.</p>

<p>Agnes was kind enough to leave her food, which today was chicken noodle soup that the school’s commercial cooking class had prepared for the cafeteria, like she did yesterday. The older lady knew that after she left the school to go to work, the one Agnes had left had additional herbs that would help keep her body cool. Rebekah was aware that some herbs started working later, after consumption due to a delayed start.</p>

<p>After drinking the remaining liquid from the surface of her bowl, Rebekah delicately repositioned it on her tray. She rose from the table and made her way to the kitchen, waving to the other women as she went by and carrying her backpack. “High Noon, Ladies!” The others smiled and laughed at her greeting, which she stated. “Noon High?” Agnes stated while grinning as she followed the teenager in the nude to her office.</p>

<p>“High Noon is when the sun is at its highest peak, according to what I discovered online.” She said to her boss, “Honestly, I thought it would be funny to say,” as she shortly parted ways with her and put her backpack on the ground. She took her hairnet and hairnet panties out of the pouch they were stored in. The teen entered the restroom, sat at the toilet, and then stood after putting her feet and legs through the openings in the “hairnet panties.” The string was felt between her butt cheeks as she drew it up and adjusted it over her privates.</p>

<p>She went back to where her apron was hanging on the hook, put her head through the top loop, and then fastened it around her waist behind her. When she was prepared, she exited the restroom and headed for her workstation. She noticed a rack on the opposite side of the machine and dragged the now-warm rack with the trays of the now-clean dishes in the metal’s end so that one of the ladies could take them just like she had done yesterday.</p>

<p>After setting up a different rack, Rebekah entered the cafeteria and proceeded to the larger metal rack holding the filthy trays. She then brought the dirty trays back into the kitchen and discreetly started placing them on the rack. The other student disregarded Rebekah as she worked and paid no attention to her when she left the classroom.</p>

<p>She moved back and forth during the Lunch Hour, taking a rack, loading trays and dishes onto it, then running the racks through the washing machine. Once they had pushed this through the machine, she switched back to another pointless rack and began placing the utensils on it. Because of how cautious she was, unlike yesterday, she did not see a tray poking out the incorrect direction. She grinned as she realized she didn’t need to turn the machine off, so there wouldn’t be any steam coming out.</p>

<p>“There we go,” she mused to herself as she checked her line to make sure everything was operating well. Before she turned around once again and started making her way back into the cafeteria. She saw that there were less students on her subsequent walk outside to get the trays, but she didn’t think much more about it before going back to her workstation.</p>

<p>Standing once more next to the machine, she felt an itch because the material of the apron and the other hairnet panties was causing some minor discomfort. She scratched the itch on her belly by slipping her hand under the apron, and then she snuck it under the other hairnet panties before returning to her work.</p>

<p>There were only three trays left in the tray return rack when she arrived, and she noticed that the cafeteria seating area was empty. This gave her a reason to smile as she stacked the three trays, brought them back into the kitchen, set them up in the racks, and gently pushed them into the machine. She then moved to the opposite side and watched as they emerged. She turned and headed to her backpack as soon as the trays had exited the machine without the trays being stuck, at which point she took off her apron and put it up on her hanger. She took off both hairnets and put them in their respective spots in the bag after hanging her apron.</p>

<p>Rebekah walked to the restroom to wipe down her privates because she knew she didn’t need to be there anymore. She then went back to her bag and brought it with her as she proceeded to locate her boss. Her boss had already shut the register and was approaching the naked teenager with a tiny envelope containing her money. Rebekah responded, “Thanks,” as she put the envelope in her backpack and headed back to class.</p>

<p>Her lessons were just as challenging as the ones she had yesterday, but because to her dedication to her studies, she was able to concentrate and do well. Her teachers praised her for her diligence as a result, while several of her students felt contempt and jealously for her. Her teachers continued with their lesson even though they were unable to exploit her body as they had hoped. When the lesson was finally over, she looked at her phone and the clocks in the school, which both read 3:30 p.m. Strangely, she didn’t feel her phone vibrating as she made her way to the door.</p>

<p>She frowned in both dread and alarm at this. She wouldn’t be compensated if no one requested her assistance. She hoped that this indicated that other members of the Helpers Union had been assisting them. “Well, I guess I could just go home. After homework, I could watch TV and, for the first time, get dressed early because I have no commitments for the rest of the day.” Rebekah thought to herself as she walked more quickly than usual to her bike.</p>

<p>She rubbed her shoulder a little, dropped her bag in the box, instinctively unlocked her bike, and before she knew what had occurred, she was seated on it. She laughed at her realization at this and then rode her bike to her apartment where she saw Walter and waved to him. “Hello, Rebekah, don’t you have work?” Rebekah shook her head in response to his question. “I think not, no one phoned, I guess. At least not now; a later time may come. She stated as she pulled her backpack out of the box and locked her bike to the bike rack.</p>

<p>She had a thought when she entered. “My apartment building is equal to the one where the scientists live on the show ... If they can use the stairs rather than the elevator, then so can I.” She continued, but she believed she had the right idea because she had noticed several people working on the elevator straight away. She then proceeded to the mailbox, where she discovered a variety of junk mail, along with a letter from the tenant’s landlord, which she put in her bag before heading up the stairs.</p>

<p>She was unable to avoid hearing the employees as she moved. “Is that girl naked”. She didn’t hear the reply, though, as she accelerated as she climbed the steps and burst into a sprint. She continued moving until she reached the first level. She caught a glance of these doors and noticed they were both shut. She hoped the people living above them weren’t concerned by the occupied apartments for whatever reason.</p>

<p>As she got close to the stairs leading up, she sprinted up them to reach the second floor. Here, one of those Nerf gun rounds unexpectedly struck her in the shoulder. She saw the gunman right away and identified him as the youngest son of a former client. He was a boy in elementary school and, based on his outfit, a private school.</p>

<p>“Oh! You’ve beaten me! hit while I was at my prime! Ohhhh!” Rebekah emphasized for dramatic effect as she effortlessly flopped onto her back as the child smiled and giggled at the play-acting of his former babysitter. “silly Rebekah!” She stood up and gave him the “bullet,” the youngster claimed. He left for his apartment, and she proceeded up the stairs on her own.</p>

<p>Once more, she attempted to sprint, but as the floors passed, her speed slowed to a brisk jog, then to a stroll as she went up the stairs to the apartment she used. She stopped as she approached her apartment and turned to see Alexandra, her neighbor and yesterday’s customer. She wanted to see how she was doing today after yesterday. However, she had noticed a sign on the door asking for quiet as she was attempting to sleep, so Rebekah nodded her head and went up to her apartment to take out her phone before dropping the bag on the floor next to the table. She collapsed into her couch and relaxed there as they put the phone down.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes as she settled down after the day’s excitement, briefly forgetting that she was still naked. Her couch was one of those comfortable leather couches that prevented perspiration or any other liquid from seeping into the cushions. But it also indicated that it wasn’t a couch you would like sitting on when entirely nude. Rebekah, however, was unconcerned at the time and chose to relax until her phone rang.</p>

<p>She grabbed it right away and picked up the phone. “Hello?” She responded, hoping it wasn’t a telemarketer and that this was for work. “Rebekah? Her boss’s voice continued, “This is Benjamine Bintott, I’m sorry for not getting back to you sooner,” and as he spoke, she got less uneasy and anxious. Rebekah responded as she struggled to control her nerves, “Oh, good afternoon, Mister Bintott, sir, it’s alright, I got to rest my feet and put my bag down, so it’s fine.”</p>

<p>“Ah, good, so the reason I called was Crystal Glacier Lake Center called us, they need some people to go there and assist, seems there’s a shortage of help over there, so you were a part of the group I was setting up to go there. Shouldn’t be too long, but I also need a favor. Could you go to Skive Castle after? They also called, but I haven’t figured out a group to go there yet,” Mister Bintott said.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded, but she immediately realized that he wouldn’t see it over the phone, so she talked instead. “Okay, I’ll jump on my bike and ride over to the rehab center before heading to Skive Castle.” Before hanging up the phone, she told him. She pulled her paycheck from her bag and put it in her purse together with the other cash. Before she hurriedly left her apartment, she grabbed the bottle of sunburn resistant lotion, applied it to her skin, and then grabbed her phone. She went downstairs after locking the door, unlocked her bike, put everything in the box, and then rode out of there while carrying it.</p>

<p>She was so preoccupied with what she was doing that she completely missed Walter’s question regarding her attire. She had indeed lost track of the fact that she was still naked due to her attention to her work.</p>

<p>She started to feel the air on her skin as she rode her bike down the road, as well as the draft from the other automobiles. She became conscious of her nakedness as a result of this. The question “Are you kidding me?” popped into her mind. “You just got home and didn’t bother to dress?” She finally said, “Oh well, it’s all right. But now that I think of it, I should park and consult the phone’s map. Both of those destinations have never been visited by me. And I, Rebekah Anne Elmstadter, am not one to assume that she is traveling the correct route.”</p>

<p>She thought to herself as she came to the red light and headed onto the next street. She twisted to pull her phone from her purse in the box and clicked on the map function. “Okay, let’s have a look ... Oh, these are the places I want to be. I must go ... Hutt Avenue, through Yoda, and Elms Street.” She said as she observed the information on her map before twisting her body once again to put her phone back in the box, lock it, and then set out on her bike once more.</p>

<p>“I’m unsure of what type of help I can provide in a setting like Crystal Glacier Lake Center, let alone, what was it?, Skive Castle?” She murmured to herself as she pedaled her bike through the streets of her hometown, “We’ll see when we get there. She continued to follow the road as she passed banks, skyscrapers, and police stations, only stepping onto the walkways where it was legally permitted. As she passed an arcade shop, she noticed the leader of her school’s girls basketball team leave it carrying a girl who slightly resembled her and some other girls as she passed by.</p>

<p>A handful of them waved at her as she walked by, indicating that they were aware of her presence. She smiled at them instead because it was not advised to take her hands off the handlebars. She started turning and used the left side roadway from the subsequent stop sign, telling herself, “Left here.” She had some time to enjoy the scenery, the trees covered in leaves and the blooming flowers, while the bike carried her to her first destination. Dogs playing joyfully in parks, kids running around, and squirrels climbing the trees were some of the things she’d seen. As she allowed herself to get sidetracked by the scenes she saw, she assumed it was tranquil.</p>

<p>She was getting close to the Center when she noticed the same signs at the entry similar to what she’d seen yesterday at the Galley. She also noticed the lake’s appearance, which was nearly crystal pure with some ice-like coloring. “It is named Crystal Glacier Lake for this reason. Who would have imagined it?” As she went down its side till she reached the bike racks, she had murmured to herself.</p>

<p>Here, she quickly dismounted, secured her bike, and used a cloth to clean her privates before examining her skin to see whether she needed to reapply additional sunburn-resistance ointment. She entered the building and proceeded to the front desk after doing so. “Rebekah Elmstadter here. I was expected to be with the Helper’s Union group. Someone from here called?” She checked with the receptionist.</p>

<p>When the teenager finished speaking, the woman, who had brilliantly lighted graying, nearly silver hair, glanced up and answered before getting up from her chair. “Yes, the others have already come and have been paired up with some of the other staff members here.” Rebekah’s attire drew her attention as she spoke, but she refrained from responding. Before calling her, Rebekah thought her supervisor had mentioned the program to her. The person Rebekah chose to refer to as Silver because of her hair had gotten up from the desk and motioned for Rebekah to follow. Rebekah had to gaze at the interior design as she walked next to the woman.</p>

<p>According to the building she was passing, some areas of the site were for kids. She assumed it was a ship. Despite having a wheel that was obviously capable of turning, the ship’s construction prevented it from doing so. In addition, she noticed a rainbow that appeared to have been there for a while based on its wear. The teenager pondered whether it would be removed or not in light of the current political situation in the world but decided against asking. She then posed a different query. “My supervisor didn’t explain much about what this facility is, precisely, only that I was a member of a group that needed to go and help here.” Silver gave Rebekah a sidelong glance as she spoke.</p>

<p>“The Crystal Glacier Center is a rehabilitation facility, however the word rehab is also sometimes used in reference to drug usage, as in individuals who come to stop using drugs. We do more than that here. We assist everyone who could have been hurt, even veterans of the conflicts they were forced to fight in. We assist patients with conditions like Apert Syndrome or, more often, cerebral palsy so they can walk if appropriate or if there is a problem.”</p>

<p>Rebekah listened as Silver described the function of the building. She remarked, “I see...” as she noticed that she wasn’t as familiar with the cited illnesses. “Actually, I had heard that there was a student at my school who had D’s Syndrome. Will they also receive assistance here?” She questioned as the two walked down a hallway that led to a central space and picked the left path. “D’s syndrome? In that relatively rare condition, the muscles in one or both legs weaken, and if the patient walks on their legs for an extended period of time, the legs or leg eventually strains under the weight.The legs spasm as though someone is having a seizure as a result of this.” To the interested nude girl, Silver said. “However, you won’t be assisting somebody who is going through that today.” She added.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the final right turn, Silver took the straight path after passing through another left hallway at the next crossroads.” Doctors Wellington! Kurosaki! I have your replacement helper for the day.” As soon as Silver said it, two men—one of African heritage and the other of Asian origin—turned around to see Rebekah in tow and Silver approaching. With the new rules in place, they were probably used to seeing nude individuals, especially teenagers, so they didn’t comment when they noticed Rebekah’s state of nudity.</p>

<p>Rebekah was left with the medical staff by Silver so they could instruct her on what to do. “Our patient inside has a weight issue and a severe fear of heights, which makes things challenging.” Dr. Wellington said. As he led the way inside, Doctor Kurosaki stated to the teen, “You’ll see inside, but we mostly need your help in distracting him while we move him to a stretcher, for transport.”</p>

<p>With the exception of the medical equipment, Rebekah saw as she entered the room with the doctors that it resembled virtually a typical bedroom. A larger apparatus appeared to be used to pull the paraplegics out of their chairs. When she first saw the patient, she rapidly restrained her feelings, especially her shock. She thought their patient looked rather overweight, which she recognized was the reason for the machine, and she also realized why he was afraid of heights. She assumed that he was scared of falling because of how overweight he appeared.</p>

<p>As soon as he yelled and the machine started, Rebekah had an idea of how to divert his attention. She approached their patient, saying, “Wait a sec,” and when she did, she noticed that the machine could lift 100 times his weight, indicating that her strategy would be successful. Asking “Who’s there!” With horror in his voice, the guy inquired. She gently put her hand on his shoulder, offering him consolation. My name is Rebecca. I am an active Helpers Union member. As she rubbed his shoulder, she spoke. She stepped near his feet before.</p>

<p>As soon as she arrived, she threw off her shoes and climbed onto the bed before crawling up his body, ducking her head, and entering the lift portion of his body. She didn’t say anything as she climbed up to his chest and laid herself on top of him, her eyes catching a sight of his privates, which were little and seemed smaller than his torso. “Hello once again!” She smiled kindly as she stated. She pushed her hands to his ears, snaking them beneath his arms. While doing so, she spoke to him. “Don’t stare at them; instead, concentrate on me and, more importantly, on my breasts and chest.” Having told him.</p>

<p>She made an effort to get him to pay attention to something else—something that many guys were interested in—instead than the doctors. She raised his arms and hands by pushing them up with her arms. She eventually persuaded him to stroke her breasts, experiencing the affects of his hands while she watched. As she raised her hands to cover his ears, she briefly turned off his hearing after previously detracting his sight and touch.</p>

<p>He found her breasts fascinating and massaged them as much as he pleased. He was so engrossed in touching her breasts that he was oblivious to the machine’s activation and hardly noticed when it hoisted him out of bed. He tried not to injure her, but he couldn’t control his strength, so his squeezes were a little painful. He tried massaging her breasts while she made an effort to hide her pain, thinking it would lessen the suffering he had caused her.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>As the crane lifted the two off the bed and transferred them to the stretcher, she could hear its sounds. She stayed to the side, compressing her arms and legs, but she didn’t let them move since doing so may make the man she was on top with distracted. She anticipated this to happen and understood that if her diversion failed; he would yell and struggle, making it more difficult to transport him. Despite how uncomfortable she was physically, she was intellectually comfortable with the idea of sacrificing her comfort in order to divert his attention.</p>

<p>When she finally turned away and the sturdy material around them had settled, she was aware that the relocation was complete. The man she was resting on top of seems to have noticed as well, as he turned around and took note of the sides’ loosened positions. He gasped in shock when he understood precisely where he was. He continued to be on top of the naked teenager and said, “You ... You distracted me. She acknowledged that she had successfully diverted his attention by nodding.</p>

<p>“Rebekah, we’re prepared to leave.” Rebekah climbed down as directed when Doctor Kurosaki suggested, “Let’s get you to climb down from there.” Before she followed by his side, she quickly ran back to put her shoes back on. But because of his dread of heights, he kept his eyes closed to avoid being startled by the disparity in height.</p>

<p>“Hey Rebekah, why did you join the Helpers Union?” asked Doctor Wellington, hoping that having her talk about it might be good to be used as a distraction to keep the patient’s mind away from where they were going. “I joined mostly because they’d helped me in the past, because of a bad situation which I’d rather not talk about. I had to leave the home I grew up in and find something new. They helped me find a place and brought in other people to help carry my measly furniture. I could call them when new furniture, like my couch, was given to me and they’d help me carry and position it.” Rebekah explained to the three.</p>

<p>“When one gave me a card, I looked online at my school and found that this would work as a second job. What’s more, I didn’t need a high school, college, or university diploma to join, which was amazing. My first job didn’t pay much in terms of bills, so my landlord was forced to turn some things off, but with this, and my first job I can do it, but barely. But there are benefits to being a member of the Helpers Union, the appreciation of others for a job well done, and the thanks are amazing. The money I get is just a bonus, at this point hehe,” Rebekah said with a chuckle and a smile on her face.</p>

<p>The three of them paid close attention as she spoke to them and discussed her motivations for joining the Helpers Union. As soon as they got at the location—which, according to the technology, including the sizable tub, was where their patient was going to get cleaned up—the talk came to an abrupt halt. “Because he is being transferred for surgery tomorrow, he has to be cleaned up.” She heard a doctor explain, but she assumed it was Doctor Kurosaki based on the way it sounded. Rebekah once more took off her shoes as they were being lowered to the edge of the tub by the Stretcher, but this time she also removed her socks.</p>

<p>She moved to the other side of the enormous tub while entirely naked, her bare feet slapping the floor under them. Before focusing on the medical staff’s maneuvers to safely get their patient to the tub, her gaze darted from one end of the enormous tub to the other. After having an idea, she had climbed in a moment later to assist in lowering him into the bathtub. She carefully escorted him down the slope into the tub by bringing him in slowly and gently from the side.</p>

<p>As the staff assisted in getting him into the tub, she muttered to herself, “There...” as she turned on the water and prepared the body wash for him. “It’s tiny to you, isn’t it?” Rebekah glanced at the patient as she spoke. She asked him, perplexed by his meaning, “What is?” “My penis is smaller than what you saw during the program,” he said. She disguised a smile after hearing him out and understanding what he was saying. He said, “Oh, no, I mean, with your body type, it might seem small, but it’s actually one of the larger ones I’ve seen,” she said.</p>

<p>As she took the soap and started assisting to clean his lower end while the staff selected the other parts, she saw a flush appear on his cheeks as a result of her comments. She felt the coolness to the touch and then washed and massaged his feet. She continued massaging him while using the warm water to stimulate blood flow in his legs. After that, she observed as the staff cleaned the rest of him. She made an effort to assist where she could, but they handled everything well.</p>

<p>When she finally managed to sneak out of the tub, she dried off with the extra towels that would have otherwise gone unused before re-putting her shoes and socks on. Afterward, she returned to assisting the others in placing him back on the stretcher before they led her to his room without him. As soon as she arrived at the bed, she yanked the pillows from their covers and the sheets off the mattress. The teenager let the items she had taken fall to the floor before picking them up and putting them in the washing hamper that had been carried into the room.</p>

<p>Doctor Wellington came just as she was finishing, and he saw her removing the bedding. “Good, I was going to ask you to help us take the sheets and pillowcases off, but we have staff for that, and the room won’t be used until they’re done, so I think you’re done with us,” he said. “Thank you for your assistance, Rebekah. Do you need me to take you to the entrance?” Rebekah nodded in response when he asked.</p>

<p>He guided her through the opposite route she and Silver had used to get to the door. She waved farewell before heading to her bike when she eventually found herself at the center’s entrance. She looked at the time when she arrived. She thought to herself, “Hmm ... I got time before supper,” and so she unlocked her bike and put her phone back in the box before riding to Skive Castle.</p>

<p>“I never knew there was a castle in town ... Oh wait, there is a place with a castle in the name, but it’s a retirement home. That could be the place. I don’t think I’ve ever helped anyone in a place like that ... But maybe they just want me to spend time with one of the seniors? That’s possible,” she said to herself as she continued on her journey.</p>

<p>As she had done while planning the route to the Center, she eventually parked her bike and checked the map on her phone to confirm that not only was she travelling in the proper direction, but also that the location she had in mind. She became concerned when she put her phone away and got back in the car since senior folks had a bad image; some were grumpy and nasty, while others may be perverse. She had thought that since they were in a retirement community, they weren’t perverse at least, but she had previously interacted with irritable and impolite people.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the Hospital as the beginning point for her route, she took two left turns, a straight street, and then a right. This is similar to how she had traveled through the Center. This led her to Skive Castle, which—contrary to its name—looked like a castle to the teenager but was more modern and less protected. She cycled to the bike rack, secured her bike, then grabbed her handbag and headed for the door. As she made her way to the front desk, she observed the architecture and the surroundings. “My boss requested me to come as a favor to him, I’m Rebekah with the Helper’s Union.” She stated while removing her ID card In order to prove her sincerity, </p>

<p>The receptionist responded, “Ah, very well, I’ll have an orderly take you into where you’re needed,” and she called someone to come down. Rebekah noted the receptionist looked to have blue hair and compared her to the silver-haired receptionist, she had seen earlier in the day. A balding man wearing an orderly uniform soon showed in. Baldy Orderly nodded and motioned for Rebekah to join him when Blue added, “She’s with the Helper’s Union, that Benjamin Bintott has sent us.”</p>

<p>“We’d like you to hang with one of our residents, just talk to him, take him out for some fresh air, and to the mall. There’s a trip going to the Grand Mall, in a bit. But, I wouldn’t expect him to talk, though. He’s shut down.” He explained to her as they soon arrived at the room numbered 88, and underneath it had a V, Bintott. That caught her attention immediately, but she didn’t know if the last name was a coincidence. They entered the room to see a old man just sitting on a chair, just staring into space. “See? It’s like he’s completely shut down. No one’s home, Unfortunately, he hasn’t had visitors for a long time, mostly because his son is very busy.”</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded while paying the orderly only passing attention. “Let’s see, he has allergies to dairy, beef, and honey-wait, I think I received the wrong file. I apologize, and I’ll be right back.” Baldy muttered and exited the room, leaving the elderly man and the nude teenage girl in the room.</p>

<p>She had an idea as she pondered what she had been told—a thought that would, in a sense, break him out of his shell. She shifted to the side where the book shelves were located and leaned against them while she took off her shoes. Because of the sandals she saw he had on his feet, she assumed her shoes would be uncomfortable if they made touch with his feet. She approached him after taking off her shoes, crawled onto his lap, and wrapped his arms around her body. She calmly addressed him and said, “Hey Grandpa, I’m sorry I didn’t visit until now.” At first, nothing occurred, but when he gripped her, he began to realize there was someone on his lap—a nude person—before he blinked his eyes.</p>

<p>“Your forgi-wait, I don’t think I know you, do I?” She shook her head when he asked. “No, I’m Rebekah; I’m a member of the Helpers Union.” She spoke with natural instinct. “Helper’s Union? I must be new since I’ve never heard of that. He stated before adding. “But why did you call me Grandpa? Are you, my son’s child?” He asked. “No, sir, however, I may be his subordinate based on your last name. I chose to adopt you, which is why I named you Grandpa,” she said. The adoption aspect made him laugh aloud uncontrollably. “OK, then I’m in favor haha!”</p>

<p>Rebekah climbed off of him and moved back as Old Bintott began rising from the chair,. “I’m Victor Bintott, by the way,” he replied, introducing himself to her. She bowed to him and introduced herself as “Rebekah Elmstadter,” which made him grin once again. However, just then, the orderly came back and was startled to find Victor not only standing but also speaking. Rebekah gave him a quick glance before turning to face Victor and grinning mischievously. “Are Orderlies like him truly that anxious?”</p>

<p>Before continuing, Victor smiled and said, “No, I think he’s the only one.” Baldy only made a head shake. “You try walking in and seeing someone move when they haven’t moved for a while.” He spoke to them while wearing a rueful grin. What Rebekah thought was the right folder for Victor was in his grasp. But since Victor was moving around, he probably didn’t need it.</p>

<p>Victor turned to face the two after scanning the room. “I don’t know about you two, but these four walls are becoming old to me. I want to take a stroll. Rebekah gave him a nod and said, “Sounds good, he mentioned a trip to the mall was scheduled for later if you’re interested.” Victor nodded while grinning. “The mall has great, good deals!” He responded as Rebekah followed him out of the room as he started to leave. “I assume from the way you’re not dressed that you’re enrolled in the program at your school, right?”</p>

<p>Victor questioned as they walked down the hallway, his arm resting on his ‘granddaughter’s’ shoulders. “Yes, I only began yesterday. Rebekah stated as she followed him, “It’s been an intriguing experience so far, especially for me because of my occupations.”</p>

<p>“Jobs, so you have multiple?” She was questioned while they were walking. Rebekah stated as they reached the Castle’s courtyard and strolled through the flower patch, “Yeah, I work at my school as a dishwasher, during lunch, and after school, I work as a Helper’s Union.” she said before “I recall the start of the Naked in School Program under the newly enacted laws. Concerning that, there was a lot of drama. Naturally, the concerns came primarily from the Conservatives, but there were also many concerns about students having sex or acting irresponsibly. However, I was a member of the committee, and it was because of me and a childhood friend that most of the laws intended to protect you and prevent pregnancy were passed.” He informed her.</p>

<p>Rebekah said, “Well, I speak for all of the good girls when I say we are grateful,” as they approached a bench. She immediately followed him in taking a seat after he did.” According to a recent rule, parents cannot opt their children out if they signed a document pledging to take part in school programs and activities. which, given my circumstance, also included me.” She disclosed. “What the fuck?! Damn the idiots who approved that! There is a strong risk the law will do harm to children.” He talked while his voice burned with anger.</p>

<p>His speech had an accent, which Rebekah thought almost sounded Scottish but may have been from his age as she listened to him. He expressed his sentiments, and she could hear the anger in his voice. When she finally spoke, she nodded. “True, however on the plus side, it is also recognized that restaurants and shops offer discounts to program members.” She chuckled as she revealed more information, before continuing. “Members of the Helper’s Union also receive discounts, so if I visit a restaurant, I run the risk of upsetting the proprietor.” Before Victor laughed, she said. “Oh, genius. Seniors also receive discounts.”</p>

<p>When the idea hit Rebekah, she grinned. “Would you want to join me for supper at Chez Remano, Victor, my dear sir?” He smiled when she asked him a question. “I believe I would be interested in joining you, Rebecca, dear lady.” Rebekah excitedly clapped with both hands. “Good, then our plan is to go to the mall and then to Chez Remano.”</p>

<p>Victor responded with a smile and a nod, expressing interest in their strategy. Even though he was a little worried about bringing a naked girl into such an exclusive restaurant, he was certain that he could come up with a solution.</p>

<p>An orderly finally showed up to the bench after what felt like an eternity. “Hey, if you’d want to go, the bus to the Grand Mall is waiting.” Victor rose to his feet at the Orderly’s comments and started guiding his “date” to the bus door. The two waited for the old women to board before they did when they arrived. Victor was made to sit in the chairs due to his age, while Rebekah grabbed the pole to cling on. She saw as the bus removed her from the bike and Skive Castle. She wasn’t concerned since she was aware that when the road trip was finished, she would be taken back.</p>

<p>The two listened as the elderly women chatted about some other subject that she wasn’t as familiar with, but she noticed they weren’t discussing the nude girl in their group. Victor and Rebekah once again permitted the women to exit the vehicle first when the bus halted at the entrance of the mall. Prior to joining Victor, Rebekah hurried to the doors and held them open for the group. They all thanked her and entered before she could.</p>

<p>As they made their way around the mall, the two eventually became separated from the women. The sights, new attire, technology, and television were all taken in. “You know ... We didn’t have such TVs—or even computers, for that matter—when I was your age.” Victor pointed out the technology to Rebekah. “A couple of friends initially opposed them, but gradually, obstinacy loses to convenience.” He explained it to her and gave Rebekah some time to consider a life without television and computers. “What did you do instead of watching TV, if it’s okay to ask?” She enquired. “Back then, we had radios, and they had shows, but most of it was voice acting. However, it gave us youngsters a chance to exercise our imaginations.” As he exposed some of his earlier enjoyment, he stated.</p>

<p>Rebekah struggled to picture what Victor’s life might have been like as a little child. In that sense, she believed that modern technology had pampered her. When she recognized a familiar face, her thoughts suddenly changed. She called out to her neighbor, astonished to find her there, “Alexandra?!” “Hey there Rebecca.” As she approached her neighbor with a walking stick, she remarked. “It’s nice to see you here.” Before noticing Rebekah’s partner, she continued speaking to Rebekah and blinked her eyes when recognition got to her. “Victor? Why Victor Bintott?” As soon as he saw her, the elderly man said, “Alexandra Blaskowits! been a while!” In a flash, he was on his way to give her a hug after saying something. He continued, “We were just talking about you,” for her benefit.</p>

<p>As she watched the two converse, Rebekah grinned and moved aside to avoid getting in the way. “Oh really, good things, I hope?” Alex questioned him. Victor told his old buddy, “Oh yes, we were talking about the program, and I mentioned how we were on the committee that worked on that so it was safe,” as they strolled and quickly found a seat where they could converse. They reminisced about their past as she began to get up, “Oh yes, I remember things were more hectic back then,” she replied.</p>

<p>Rebekah interrupted her when she stated, “I want to keep talking but I’m feeling thirsty.” Rebekah said, “I’ll get it, just water, right?” and Rebekah quickly left for the location where she knew they sold the greatest water after receiving her nod.</p>

<p>Victor was the first to comment as the elderly couple watched her go fetch water. “I’d want to meet her parents; she’s a nice, caring girl. She was well-raised by them. Alexandra nodded as he spoke to her. They did, yes, but I don’t believe she has any. She lives across the street from me, but I’ve never seen an adult leave that apartment. I checked around, and she was the only person there. When I called, I found out she was an emancipated adolescent. Victor was astonished when Alexandra revealed this.</p>

<p>He responded to her, “She adopted me, you know.” Victor explained to Alexandra how he first met Rebekah. “She brought me out, called me Grandpa, and said she adopted me,” he said. “After Benny stopped visiting due to work, and no one else appeared interested, I started to shut down.”</p>

<p>Alexandra was taken aback to learn that he had shut down, but she grinned when she learned that Rebekah had adopted him. “So cute! I’ve kind of adopted her as well, so I guess we are her new family,” They went silent as Rebekah came back with two glasses of water and gave it to the two of them. She had an additional water bottle under her arm, so she sipped from it with her hands free.</p>

<p>Rebekah gained more knowledge about their friendship as time went on and discovered that they attended the same high school and university. When she heard of their antics and escapades, she grinned and laughed. The recent rules had been communicated to Alexandra by a friend who is still active in politics, but she had no method of getting in touch with Victor and couldn’t let him know. The Alexandra asked about life at Skive Castle once she discovered he was a resident there. particularly the way the employees handled the residents. Rebekah learned that Skive Castle was among the top 10 destinations for the elderly and that it had excellent web evaluations.</p>

<p>If she wasn’t married by then, which she hoped to be, she imagined she could go there when it came time for her to retire. But because of how her parents treated her, Rebekah was someone who would be picky about her love partner.</p>

<p>As the two elderly individuals were talking, Rebekah pulled out her phone and made the reservation for Chez Remano. So that they could seat three instead of two, as she added Alexandra to the reservation. After confirming the reservation, Alexandra drove them to their destination rather than riding the bus with the other women.</p>

<p>Rebekah mentioned that her bike was back at the retirement community, and since the car was warm and comfortable inside, Alexandra agreed to drop her back there so she could collect it. Rebekah observed as the two of them made jokes in front of her as the car sped to their next stop as if they hadn’t been apart for a long time. They were soon on their way to the restaurant, and she grinned to see them acting in this manner.</p>

<p>Rebekah led the way to the entrance with the others following after her as she got out of the car first. Unexpectedly, a teenager in her birthday suit arrived. When it turned out that the older couple was accompanying her, the maître d was forced to admit them. She could see the expression on his face as Victor and Alexandra displayed their cards to demonstrate their seniority, as well as when she presented him with her Helper’s Union card and her program outreach card.</p>

<p>She anticipated his yelling out in rage. Fortunately, the man hadn’t, and they were shown to an appropriate table with an attractive view. Even with all the cards being used, Victor and Alexandra convinced her to sit on their coats rather than towels since they were sure that would be more expensive.</p>

<p>Victor wanted a roast beef, while Alexandra and Rebekah both wanted the same thing: Fiera bon-caobari. Victor and Alexandra chose a light wine, and Rebekah requested apple juice. As is customary in restaurants, the preparation of the dish and its delivery gave everyone enough opportunity to converse once again.</p>

<p>Victor spotted Alexandra moving with a stick and inquired about it after Rebekah had decided not to inquire about the message. Alexandra responded by explaining the mishap in the tub, but had chosen to downplay the extent of the harm she had sustained.</p>

<p>The three started eating their supper after what felt like hours had passed. Rebekah felt like they were the focus of attention despite the fact that they were quiet since the establishment preferred it than noisy talking in typical fast-food restaurants. She questioned whether it was due of her nudity and quietly scanned the room, observing other patrons. They were elegantly attired, wearing gowns, suits and ties, or tuxedos. She was the only one who was nude among them. Rebekah was unconcerned by this fact, though.</p>

<p>As the three of them ate their meals, she forced herself to act normally so as not to startle the others. The women eventually excused themselves to go the restroom, where they conversed while using the facilities. When they returned to Victor, the older people had already collected their coats, and Victor had paid for their lunch. After saying her goodbyes to Victor, Rebekah boarded her bike after Alexandra drove them to the retirement residence.</p>

<p>Rebekah got back on the road and rode her bike home, but this time she was surrounded by light since Alexandra was driving behind her and left her lights on, making Rebekah even brighter. The two of them eventually parted ways to park (Alexandra) or secure their bikes (Rebekah) on the way home. Together, they went inside, rode the elevator to their floor, and then dispersed to enter their own apartments.</p>

<p>Rebekah took a shower before she did her homework.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Hanging Out With the Quiet Girl</h2>
<div class="date">Posted: <script>document.write(new Date(1697410106000).toLocaleString());</script>10/16/2023, 5:48:26 AM<noscript>2023-10-15 6:48:26 pm</noscript></div>

<p>She was still compelled by the program’s guidelines to remain undressed during the full school and work week when the middle of the week rolled around. Because of the unexpected areas that she could get to, the experience was rather unusual. Rebekah thought back on what had happened the day before while she was making breakfast. Instead of the usual random calls for help, Mister Bintott, her boss, called her after a little while with a strange request. He had informed her that he would be putting her in a group visiting the Crystal Glacier Lake Center, a recovery facility.</p>

<p>The distance and direction to her house from the Facility were greater than they had ever been. She also visited Skive Castle, a retirement community for the elderly, in addition to the Crystal Glacier Lake Center.</p>

<p>She stopped everything she was doing due to the thought of Crystal Glacier Center and delicately put her hands on her breasts, lifting them as gently as she could. She studied her breasts, running her fingertips over the delicate and firm areas. Her breasts were somewhat uncomfortable from the man’s touching and squeezing, but so far, there didn’t appear to be any bruising, at least from what she could see in the kitchen’s light. Although she was aware that the fact she was naked would still draw attention, the absence of bruises meant that no one would focus on her as a result, which pleased her.</p>

<p>She grinned as her attention turned to Skive Castle and how she had discovered Victor and Alexandra were childhood friends. She hoped the two could speak when she entered her apartment by phone or other form of contact and that their relationship may develop into something more. But the teenager understood that if that wasn’t the case, she didn’t have the right to push it.</p>

<p>Even though she felt Victor and Alexandra would make a nice couple, she believed that as a teenager, she had no right to manipulate others who were older than her. Both to them and to anybody nearby, it would be impolite and insulting. Naturally, she would be open and honest if one inquired about the other, such as if Alexandra requested her opinion about the now-older Victor or vice versa.</p>

<p>Despite the suffering she had endured, Alexandra was a kind, compassionate woman who was always prepared to try and assist others. While Victor was a decent and upright man and considerate of others, particularly those who are his own gender’s opposite.</p>

<p>Her supervisor contacted her last night after homework, complimenting her on the superb work she had completed that day in addition to her work with his father, and he added in an amused tone of voice that it sounded like he now had a sister. She tested things since she could tell by the tone of his voice that he found it amusing, and she thanked her older brother for his kind words. She noticed she hadn’t laughed so hard in a while as the two burst out in laughter. She pondered what her next day at work would entail as soon as he hung up.</p>

<p>Naturally, she was aware that anything might happen and that she could take actions that would make her dirty or keep her clean.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time</b></p>

<p>On Wednesday during lunch, Rebekah sat at the participant’s table and remained mute. Like yesterday, they discussed some of the requests they had to put up with. She remembered the oddest request yesterday, and how she surprised them when she spoke. How she was forced to make a boy kneeling ‘kiss’ his cheek with the ‘lips’ of her crotch. She had no reason not to complete the mission, as long as nothing got into her privates, according to the guidelines. She recalled how the youngster had become irritated when he cleaned his cheek first for the purpose of cleanliness after it had made her uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Now, based on the boy’s response, she couldn’t help but wonder whether bathing and taking a shower was a strange notion to certain people. She was shocked by how open-minded and reasonable she had been in embracing the idea. The boy’s cheek was filthy, maybe from carpentry or the automotive class. Despite her suspicions, she assumed he was a sports person—a jock, as she thought they were called—based on the odd letter jacket he was wearing.</p>

<p>He may have been a jock, according to Rebekah’s theory, explaining his behavior. Some schools held jocks in high esteem, for some odd reason. Although, she had to accept that her high school experience was different, as it focused on classes rather than other activities.</p>

<p>Agnes had kindly left her food for her to eat, which was again hot dogs prepared for the cafeteria by the school’s commercial cooking class today. Naturally, Agnes had given Rebekah a plate with additional herbs, which the older woman knew would help keep her body cool after she left the school to go to work. Rebekah was aware of this. In addition to the fact that some herbs had a delayed start.</p>

<p>Rebekah was once again appreciative of Agnes’s thoughtfulness in making sure she had eaten. She occasionally only had time to do her schoolwork after work before giving in to tiredness and retiring to bed. She did consider getting up earlier to attempt to prepare something after all, but earlier meant approximately 5 in the morning. Amazingly, she awoke at 6:30 in the morning. Despite the fact that 5 was an hour ago, she lacked the strength to manage it. Rebekah grinned cheerfully, since Agnes didn’t protest to her about having to leave food for her.</p>

<p>Rebekah licked the ketchup off her lips with a napkin after eating the wiener. Her taste buds savored the flavor of the meat and ketchup combination as well as the flavor the additional herbs contributed. She speculated that possibly Agnes used it to enhance the flavor the herbs could have provided because some of the herbs had a delectable taste to them that tasted like sugar. After finishing her savoring, she got up from the table, took her backpack, and proceeded into the kitchen, passing the other women and waving to them as she went.</p>

<p>The ladies returned her wave and greeted her, even though they saw that, unlike yesterday, she didn’t say High Noon. Since she assumed they already knew when it was, she decided the next time she should think of something new. Agnes followed the teenager to where her apron was hung without saying anything.</p>

<p>The two split off in the back as she moved to where her apron hung. While Rebekah was getting ready, her lunch boss checked something in her office. She removed her hairnet and hairnet panties from their pouch in her bag and then set her backpack down. The teen entered the bathroom, sat down on the toilet, and then stood after putting her feet and legs through the openings in the “hairnet panties.” She pulled it up over her privates, like she had done yesterday, and felt the string between her butt cheeks.</p>

<p>She went back to her bag, and pulled her apron down after recalling that she had left it on the hook. She discreetly lowered it before slipping her head through the top loop and tying it around her waist at the back. When she was prepared, she went outside to her station. She noticed a rack leave the washing machine as she walked up to it, so she moved the now-warm rack with the trays of freshly cleaned dishes to the end of the metal so one of the women could take them.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s job was boring, but she didn’t complain about it, even though she wasn’t sure whether she could handle it after eight years of school. But she was confident that she would continue, carry out her job, and do it effectively.</p>

<p>After setting up a different rack, Rebekah entered the cafeteria and proceeded to the larger metal rack holding the filthy trays. She then brought the dirty trays back into the kitchen and discreetly started placing them on the rack. The other student disregarded Rebekah as she worked and paid no attention to her when she left the cafeteria.</p>

<p>She moved back and forth during the Lunch Hour, taking a rack, loading trays and dishes onto it, then running the racks through the washing machine. Once this was put through the machine, she switched back and grabbed one of the pointless racks to begin placing the utensils on them. Later, though, she realized that a tray was jutting out the incorrect direction, so she hit the machine’s stop button and raised its side to get access.</p>

<p>She muttered an expletive because she knew she had erred, just like she had on Monday, but she knew what to do.</p>

<p>As the machine’s hot steam billowed out, she took a step back before reaching inside, adjusting the tray so that it could fit, closing the lid, and turning the machine back on. She observed the rack carrying the freshly realigned tray pass through to the opposite side. “There we go,” she thought to herself before turning around once again and making her way back into the cafeteria. As she walked, she mumbled to herself, “Rebekah, be careful.”</p>

<p>She was aware that mistakes may create delays and that, if she wasn’t attentive, plates or water containers might get damaged.</p>

<p>She saw that there were fewer students on her subsequent walk outside to get the trays, but she didn’t dwell on it and went back to her desk. She understood that she would finish her task sooner after the kids had finished eating and had left the cafeteria. But occasionally, she would never finish before the fourth period bell rung.</p>

<p>Standing next to the machine once more, she recalled the itching that the fabric of the apron and the hairnet panties had given her. She didn’t itch from the apron this time, maybe because her body was accustomed to it. However, the hairnet pants were giving her an itch, so before returning to her job, she reached beneath and stroked the itch there.</p>

<p>She smiled as she stacked the three trays, brought them back into the kitchen, set them up in the racks, and gently guided them into the machine. She then moved to the other side and watched them come out. As she approached the tray return rack, she discovered that there were only three trays left. She also noticed that the cafeteria seating area was empty. She turned and proceeded to her backpack as she took off her apron and put it up on her hangar once they had exited without the trays becoming stuck. She took both hairnets off after hanging her apron and put them back in the bag.</p>

<p><b>3:30 PM School’s End</b></p>

<p>When she arrived at her school’s doors, her phone started to ring as usual. It indicated that, in contrast to yesterday, her employer had not assigned her to a group traveling to certain medical facilities. She spoke after pressing the green phone button. “How may I assist you, I’m Rebekah, a member of the Helper’s Union?” In contrast to yesterday and the day before, she chose to answer and conduct herself more professionally. Since she had joined the Helper’s Union, her supervisor hadn’t asked for this, but she wanted to seem more professional.</p>

<p>She also thought they already knew when they phoned that she belonged to the Helpers Union. “Is this the Rebekah that attends Sir Frederick Banting High School right now?” She thought the voice on the other end was feminine. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Helper’s Union members aren’t permitted to discuss that material due to privacy concerns.” She answered, raising an eyebrow in alarm. Someone was aware that Rebekah, a pupil at Sir Frederick Banting High School, belonged to the Helper’s Union. She wasn’t sure how they achieved it, but she guessed that it may have been because their child remembered their face after seeing her face on the app.</p>

<p>In addition, Rebekah thought the woman’s speech tone made her sound arrogant. Although she didn’t have a good feeling about the woman, she had no reason to turn down her request thus far.</p>

<p>‘Fuck!” Rebekah was astonished to hear the woman use foul language, but she didn’t let it disturb her because she had heard worse. “Because she’s attractive and enrolled in the program, I desired the Rebekah who lives there. I also wanted them to become friends with my daughter so that she could finally have a friend and start interacting with people.” Rebekah chose to refer to the woman as Mother Client after what she had stated. Rebekah recognized that establishing friends weren’t always easy, especially for people who struggled with social anxiety. “So your daughter doesn’t have friends, or if she does, they aren’t good friends?” For the purpose of confirmation, Rebekah asked.</p>

<p>“I think that stupid girl is being silly when she claims that she has no friends at all.” Mother Client remarked, which stoked Rebekah’s anger.</p>

<p>Rebekah allowed her emotions to settle, and after a while, she spoke. “It’s not always easy to make friends, but what’s your daughter’s name?” Rebekah asked of the woman, who replied with. “Oh, her name’s Andrea, are you going to accept the job? Or be silly like her.” Rude Mother client asked, with what sounded like an impatient huff. Rebekah, at this point, was ready to just say no, for the woman’s rudeness, but if she said no, another may not, another who wasn’t good, and was in it for the money and the wrong reasons. Someone who would most likely force the daughter to do things she didn’t want to.</p>

<p>Rebekah was unaware that such a person worked for the Helper’s Union because her boss conducted extensive background checks.</p>

<p>Rebekah said, “Andrea, huh,” and as she spoke the name, she heard what may have been an eep or a squeak. The teen heard a noise and went to look in that direction when she noticed a blonde-haired girl who looked to be in the ninth grade. She was hiding behind some boxes close to the entrance, hunkered, and when she saw Rebekah, she glanced up at her with an expression of fright on her face. Looking down at her, Rebekah responded, “Alright, I accept. “Good,” The Rude Woman said, “I’ll tell her to meet you by the back doors.” Right before she hung up, the mother remarked. Rebekah saw how she withheld the address of the home she and her daughter shared, but assumed the daughter was aware of it.</p>

<p>She dropped on her knees, putting her phone away before she knelt. Mostly based on the response she had received, she had a suspicion that this was Andrea. When the other teen’s phone sounded with a fresh message, she screamed as she was going to speak to her. Rebecca squirmed at the din. She emphasized how important it was for her to say, “It’s going to be ok,” in an empathetic way. “I intended to stoop and kneel to make myself smaller and less threatening, so I’ll step back a bit for your comfort.” She informed the other teenager and watched as she pulled out her phone to see the message it had received.</p>

<p>Rebekah considered how she would finish the day’s work as she went along. She had these ideas as a result of her inexperience, friendships, and socializing with them. She ultimately decided that she would follow Andrea’s lead.</p>

<p>observing how Andrea’s terror response seemed to grow as passersby passed. Rebekah gently reached out and took the other teen’s hand, drawing her along with her as they made their way to the building’s doors and out of it. Rebekah thought that by leading them to the parking lot, where the crowds were significantly smaller, Andrea’s emotional condition would improve noticeably. Rebekah saw another issue, particularly the box behind her, as she got to her bike.</p>

<p>She could transport enormous and heavy goods with ease thanks to its durability, but she had never carried a person inside. She was unsure about how to place Andrea as her butt would be seen if Andrea sat facing her. She could still be seen if she sat sideways since her butt would be to the side. She decided to walk her bike rather than get on since she didn’t believe Andrea would want to sit with her back to her.</p>

<p>She forced her bike to leave the bike lock area by pushing on the handlebars. Andrea moved into position next to her and walked with her as they made their way toward the perimeter of the the school’s premises Rebekah noticed the terror Andrea appeared to be feeling in the corner of her eyes and changed their course as she noticed the anxiety intensifying. Before taking Andrea to the park, Rebekah showed Andrea the entrance to her apartment, secured it, and had Walter bring the bag up.</p>

<p>The girls cast a quick glance around and noted the absence of people. Between the conclusion of the school day and the crowding of people, in Rebekah’s opinion, there was a pause. She thought they needed to take advantage of the situation and simply have fun there by swinging on the swing set. Go down the slides, just sit there, and don’t say anything really significant. Rebekah realized it wouldn’t be a good idea for her to ride the slide as she was completely naked. She was aware that flesh and slides did not go together.</p>

<p>After being still for a while, Andrea looked at Rebekah and then pulled the teenager toward the swing set with the hand that was still holding her. She gently placed Rebekah onto the swing before moving behind her to push her and finally forcing her to go as high as she wanted.</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled as she experienced the ‘butter fly’ feeling when she went up and the effect when she went down. Additionally, she was aware of the hand touching her back and the wind and pushed wind contacting her flesh. While swinging, she observed Andrea not attempting the other swing, so she stopped and gently escorted Andrea to the other swing. “Your turn,” she replied, helping Andrea into the second swing and giving her a little push so that she could swing just as Andrea had done for her. Rebekah could almost see the smile growing as Andrea raised as high as she was prepared to go.</p>

<p>When Rebekah saw this, a grin also sprang on her face, and she believed she was succeeding. She had intended to spend time with her without any obligations and without forcing Andrea to communicate.</p>

<p>She had watched enough television programs to understand that it wasn’t a good idea to force someone to do anything when they weren’t ready to discuss. However, the nudist teenager was curious to know if she was silent because she was bashful or if she suffered from social anxiety. She suspected shyness since she had admitted to her mother that she found it difficult, but she believed that people with social anxiety could talk to their parents but not so much to others outside of their immediate family. Sadly, she wasn’t as aware of the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Because Rebekah was so preoccupied with her thoughts, she failed to notice when Andrea stopped swinging and turned to face her. She blinked and took a little step back when she saw her new friend’s face so close to her own. “Oh! Sorry, I must have been thinking a much.” She informed her with a grin, but one that was more on the sheepish side than usual.</p>

<p>She made the decision not to share her thoughts with her since she believed Andrea would find it awkward/</p>

<p>When the naked teenager saw Andrea looking at her clock, she peered in and took note of the time. She was aware that she would soon need to take Andrea home or arrange for her mother to pick her up. She also observed teenagers and parents or babysitters with children entering the park. Rebekah winced as Andrea huddled behind her, her fingers digging into her back in terror at the sight of the gathering. Andrea was given a back embrace by Rebekah after she caught hold of her hands and shifted them.</p>

<p>After that, the naked teenager and her companion started to back away from the swings. It was strange to see a female going about in the nude, as another, clothed girl embraced her from behind. Rebekah was aware of her breathing and the sensation of her face, particularly the touch of her nose. Andrea could clearly see the physical effects Rebekah’s life had had on her.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s physique was toned as a result of her profession; nevertheless, it wasn’t like a Jock’s. Her arm gained some strength from the hours, or rather years, of lifting large objects, while her legs got toned from all the walking and jogging. Despite the way her physique seemed, she was aware that it didn’t much increase her stamina.</p>

<p>As they got away from the crowds, Rebekah guided the two towards her apartment, guiding Andrea so that she wasn’t embracing her so closely and so that they could walk side by side. “We should go to my place so I may get dressed and-huh?.” After saying something, Rebekah blinked as Andrea swiftly shook her head. Rebekah immediately spoke to her right away since she believed she wanted to leave her. “Oh! If you like, you can come with me. Come on, I’m not making you remain down here,” Rebekah said as she led the way inside. “Who is that with you, Rebekah?” Tim, Walter’s coworker, questioned her as he walked to his place at the doors.</p>

<p>Andrea was stopped from going behind once again by Rebekah’s arm over her shoulder. “This is Andrea; I a new a friend of mine. Rebekah informed him, “She’s a little shy.” Tim grinned and nodded before abruptly giving each of them a lollypop. “Well, it’s good to meet you, Andrea, and Rebekah is such a wonderful friend. She is really helpful and polite,” he informed her. Rebekah took the lollypop and led the way to the elevator, where she unwrapped the lollypop and put it in her mouth before pressing the elevator’s button and going up with Andrea.</p>

<p>“I know, the whole saying don’t take candy from strangers thing, but Tim is a good guy. He wouldn’t dare harm anyone. He makes these from scratch and he has a technique to preserve the taste from juices. His source is the garden up in the roof and we could check it out if you’d like.” Before the elevator arrived at her floor, she said and started to suck the lollipop.</p><div id="sr"><script src="/res/js/clickForMore.js" async=""></script><div class="c b"><i>There is more of this text...</i><br><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="ld1()" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:15px auto auto auto;box-shadow:0 0 .3em #777;padding:5px;border-radius:.3em;font-weight:bold;font-family:sans-serif;text-align:center;max-width:15em">Click to Load text...</a><br><a href="/doc/Click-to-Load-text">Why?</a></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 3: Hanging Out With the Quiet Girl</h2>

<p>She was still compelled by the program’s guidelines to remain undressed during the full school and work week when the middle of the week rolled around. Because of the unexpected areas that she could get to, the experience was rather unusual. Rebekah thought back on what had happened the day before while she was making breakfast. Instead of the usual random calls for help, Mister Bintott, her boss, called her after a little while with a strange request. He had informed her that he would be putting her in a group visiting the Crystal Glacier Lake Center, a recovery facility.</p>

<p>The distance and direction to her house from the Facility were greater than they had ever been. She also visited Skive Castle, a retirement community for the elderly, in addition to the Crystal Glacier Lake Center.</p>

<p>She stopped everything she was doing due to the thought of Crystal Glacier Center and delicately put her hands on her breasts, lifting them as gently as she could. She studied her breasts, running her fingertips over the delicate and firm areas. Her breasts were somewhat uncomfortable from the man’s touching and squeezing, but so far, there didn’t appear to be any bruising, at least from what she could see in the kitchen’s light. Although she was aware that the fact she was naked would still draw attention, the absence of bruises meant that no one would focus on her as a result, which pleased her.</p>

<p>She grinned as her attention turned to Skive Castle and how she had discovered Victor and Alexandra were childhood friends. She hoped the two could speak when she entered her apartment by phone or other form of contact and that their relationship may develop into something more. But the teenager understood that if that wasn’t the case, she didn’t have the right to push it.</p>

<p>Even though she felt Victor and Alexandra would make a nice couple, she believed that as a teenager, she had no right to manipulate others who were older than her. Both to them and to anybody nearby, it would be impolite and insulting. Naturally, she would be open and honest if one inquired about the other, such as if Alexandra requested her opinion about the now-older Victor or vice versa.</p>

<p>Despite the suffering she had endured, Alexandra was a kind, compassionate woman who was always prepared to try and assist others. While Victor was a decent and upright man and considerate of others, particularly those who are his own gender’s opposite.</p>

<p>Her supervisor contacted her last night after homework, complimenting her on the superb work she had completed that day in addition to her work with his father, and he added in an amused tone of voice that it sounded like he now had a sister. She tested things since she could tell by the tone of his voice that he found it amusing, and she thanked her older brother for his kind words. She noticed she hadn’t laughed so hard in a while as the two burst out in laughter. She pondered what her next day at work would entail as soon as he hung up.</p>

<p>Naturally, she was aware that anything might happen and that she could take actions that would make her dirty or keep her clean.</p>

<p>“I think that stupid girl is being silly when she claims that she has no friends at all.” Mother Client remarked, which stoked Rebekah’s anger.</p>

<p>Rebekah allowed her emotions to settle, and after a while, she spoke. “It’s not always easy to make friends, but what’s your daughter’s name?” Rebekah asked of the woman, who replied with. “Oh, her name’s Andrea, are you going to accept the job? Or be silly like her.” Rude Mother client asked, with what sounded like an impatient huff. Rebekah, at this point, was ready to just say no, for the woman’s rudeness, but if she said no, another may not, another who wasn’t good, and was in it for the money and the wrong reasons. Someone who would most likely force the daughter to do things she didn’t want to.</p>

<p>Rebekah was unaware that such a person worked for the Helper’s Union because her boss conducted extensive background checks.</p>

<p>Rebekah said, “Andrea, huh,” and as she spoke the name, she heard what may have been an eep or a squeak. The teen heard a noise and went to look in that direction when she noticed a blonde-haired girl who looked to be in the ninth grade. She was hiding behind some boxes close to the entrance, hunkered, and when she saw Rebekah, she glanced up at her with an expression of fright on her face. Looking down at her, Rebekah responded, “Alright, I accept. “Good,” The Rude Woman said, “I’ll tell her to meet you by the back doors.” Right before she hung up, the mother remarked. Rebekah saw how she withheld the address of the home she and her daughter shared, but assumed the daughter was aware of it.</p>

<p>She dropped on her knees, putting her phone away before she knelt. Mostly based on the response she had received, she had a suspicion that this was Andrea. When the other teen’s phone sounded with a fresh message, she screamed as she was going to speak to her. Rebecca squirmed at the din. She emphasized how important it was for her to say, “It’s going to be ok,” in an empathetic way. “I intended to stoop and kneel to make myself smaller and less threatening, so I’ll step back a bit for your comfort.” She informed the other teenager and watched as she pulled out her phone to see the message it had received.</p>

<p>Rebekah considered how she would finish the day’s work as she went along. She had these ideas as a result of her inexperience, friendships, and socializing with them. She ultimately decided that she would follow Andrea’s lead.</p>

<p>observing how Andrea’s terror response seemed to grow as passersby passed. Rebekah gently reached out and took the other teen’s hand, drawing her along with her as they made their way to the building’s doors and out of it. Rebekah thought that by leading them to the parking lot, where the crowds were significantly smaller, Andrea’s emotional condition would improve noticeably. Rebekah saw another issue, particularly the box behind her, as she got to her bike.</p>

<p>She could transport enormous and heavy goods with ease thanks to its durability, but she had never carried a person inside. She was unsure about how to place Andrea as her butt would be seen if Andrea sat facing her. She could still be seen if she sat sideways since her butt would be to the side. She decided to walk her bike rather than get on since she didn’t believe Andrea would want to sit with her back to her.</p>

<p>She forced her bike to leave the bike lock area by pushing on the handlebars. Andrea moved into position next to her and walked with her as they made their way toward the perimeter of the the school’s premises Rebekah noticed the terror Andrea appeared to be feeling in the corner of her eyes and changed their course as she noticed the anxiety intensifying. Before taking Andrea to the park, Rebekah showed Andrea the entrance to her apartment, secured it, and had Walter bring the bag up.</p>

<p>The girls cast a quick glance around and noted the absence of people. Between the conclusion of the school day and the crowding of people, in Rebekah’s opinion, there was a pause. She thought they needed to take advantage of the situation and simply have fun there by swinging on the swing set. Go down the slides, just sit there, and don’t say anything really significant. Rebekah realized it wouldn’t be a good idea for her to ride the slide as she was completely naked. She was aware that flesh and slides did not go together.</p>

<p>After being still for a while, Andrea looked at Rebekah and then pulled the teenager toward the swing set with the hand that was still holding her. She gently placed Rebekah onto the swing before moving behind her to push her and finally forcing her to go as high as she wanted.</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled as she experienced the ‘butter fly’ feeling when she went up and the effect when she went down. Additionally, she was aware of the hand touching her back and the wind and pushed wind contacting her flesh. While swinging, she observed Andrea not attempting the other swing, so she stopped and gently escorted Andrea to the other swing. “Your turn,” she replied, helping Andrea into the second swing and giving her a little push so that she could swing just as Andrea had done for her. Rebekah could almost see the smile growing as Andrea raised as high as she was prepared to go.</p>

<p>When Rebekah saw this, a grin also sprang on her face, and she believed she was succeeding. She had intended to spend time with her without any obligations and without forcing Andrea to communicate.</p>

<p>She had watched enough television programs to understand that it wasn’t a good idea to force someone to do anything when they weren’t ready to discuss. However, the nudist teenager was curious to know if she was silent because she was bashful or if she suffered from social anxiety. She suspected shyness since she had admitted to her mother that she found it difficult, but she believed that people with social anxiety could talk to their parents but not so much to others outside of their immediate family. Sadly, she wasn’t as aware of the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Because Rebekah was so preoccupied with her thoughts, she failed to notice when Andrea stopped swinging and turned to face her. She blinked and took a little step back when she saw her new friend’s face so close to her own. “Oh! Sorry, I must have been thinking a much.” She informed her with a grin, but one that was more on the sheepish side than usual.</p>

<p>She made the decision not to share her thoughts with her since she believed Andrea would find it awkward/</p>

<p>When the naked teenager saw Andrea looking at her clock, she peered in and took note of the time. She was aware that she would soon need to take Andrea home or arrange for her mother to pick her up. She also observed teenagers and parents or babysitters with children entering the park. Rebekah winced as Andrea huddled behind her, her fingers digging into her back in terror at the sight of the gathering. Andrea was given a back embrace by Rebekah after she caught hold of her hands and shifted them.</p>

<p>After that, the naked teenager and her companion started to back away from the swings. It was strange to see a female going about in the nude, as another, clothed girl embraced her from behind. Rebekah was aware of her breathing and the sensation of her face, particularly the touch of her nose. Andrea could clearly see the physical effects Rebekah’s life had had on her.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s physique was toned as a result of her profession; nevertheless, it wasn’t like a Jock’s. Her arm gained some strength from the hours, or rather years, of lifting large objects, while her legs got toned from all the walking and jogging. Despite the way her physique seemed, she was aware that it didn’t much increase her stamina.</p>

<p>As they got away from the crowds, Rebekah guided the two towards her apartment, guiding Andrea so that she wasn’t embracing her so closely and so that they could walk side by side. “We should go to my place so I may get dressed and-huh?.” After saying something, Rebekah blinked as Andrea swiftly shook her head. Rebekah immediately spoke to her right away since she believed she wanted to leave her. “Oh! If you like, you can come with me. Come on, I’m not making you remain down here,” Rebekah said as she led the way inside. “Who is that with you, Rebekah?” Tim, Walter’s coworker, questioned her as he walked to his place at the doors.</p>

<p>Andrea was stopped from going behind once again by Rebekah’s arm over her shoulder. “This is Andrea; I a new a friend of mine. Rebekah informed him, “She’s a little shy.” Tim grinned and nodded before abruptly giving each of them a lollypop. “Well, it’s good to meet you, Andrea, and Rebekah is such a wonderful friend. She is really helpful and polite,” he informed her. Rebekah took the lollypop and led the way to the elevator, where she unwrapped the lollypop and put it in her mouth before pressing the elevator’s button and going up with Andrea.</p>

<p>“I know, the whole saying don’t take candy from strangers thing, but Tim is a good guy. He wouldn’t dare harm anyone. He makes these from scratch and he has a technique to preserve the taste from juices. His source is the garden up in the roof and we could check it out if you’d like.” Before the elevator arrived at her floor, she said and started to suck the lollipop.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>Due of Andrea’s dread of crowds and the likelihood that the elevator may stop at a floor other than hers, Rebekah knew how risky this had been. She was relieved that this did not occur as a result of the lull as she walked Andrea to her room and opened the door before leading Andrea inside. Andrea was able to take a thorough look inside once they turned on the lights. Okay, I’m going to go get dressed, so i’ll be right-huh?” Rebekah said before blinking once again in response to Andrea grabbing her arm and shaking her head. “Oh! You weren’t so much against my getting dressed as you were that I was about to abandon you. Are you more at ease with me being naked?” Rebecca asked.</p>

<p>Andrea gave a little nod before speaking. “Yes.” Rebekah was glad to hear Andrea speak after a long silence. However, the teenager decided not to make a big deal out of it because it could make Andrea uncomfortable. “Rebekah answered, “Ok, then, I’ll stay naked,” and sat down on the couch after grabbing a towel to sit on. “You know, this was my first time having a visitor at my home.” She told her while sporting a faint smile.</p>

<p>It was regrettably true that she was unable to have friends over as a result of her job; but, given that Alexandra was a friend of hers, it was probable that this would soon change as well.</p>

<p>Andrea was scanning the area, noting the bathroom and one-person bedroom, and Rebekah couldn’t help but catch her eye. She anticipated the issue because Rebekah was obviously in high school and was thus likely to have parents. Rebekah told Andrea, “They don’t live with me, and they aren’t around,” as soon as she caught her gaze. She looked shocked, which proved Rebekah was correct. “However, I’d prefer not to talk about it. They are still alive, I’ll say that.” Andrea appeared to grasp what she said as she nodded, and she was grateful that she didn’t inquire further.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s mind began to think about the program and of Andrea in new ways. She knew that if Andrea’s mother kept attempting to push her daughter into social situations and interactions, she may really enroll her in the program. Of course, given the current laws, it’s still possible for it to occur. The teen nevertheless desired to caution her, but.</p>

<p>“I ... I wanted to warn you, mostly from the impression I got from your mom ... You might be in the program, soon if you hadn’t already.” Mostly out of fear for Andrea, Rebekah stated. She had seen timid girls in the program and saw their reluctance to participate in certain activities as well as their unwillingness to sit with other program participants. Although she couldn’t recall if Andrea had participated in the program, she had intended to warn and perhaps even prepare her. That is something a friend would do, in her opinion. When Rebekah noticed Andrea’s cheeks starting to pink, she frowned.</p>

<p>She began, but glanced away since she, too, was uncomfortable with it. “Just ... Just remember, they can touch but can’t penetrate you, with anything.” She enjoyed working for the Helper’s Union and as a dishwasher because neither position required her to perform such a task. When Rebekah considered performing some of the things she had to do to Andrea, she felt repulsed, but she reasoned that it would be excessive and not at all what a friend would do.</p>

<p>Rebekah instead made her way to her kitchenette, where she retrieved some snacks from the cabinet and returned them to Andrea’s seat. Andrea watched her from behind, watching where she walked and then spotting the snacks. She gave her hostess a grin. Andrea grabbed a handful of the treats as Rebekah set the platter on the table. Rebekah herself had a snack, then went back to get two glasses of warm milk and juice to accompany it for the two of them. She considered it lucky until she recalled that not everyone could enjoy milk the way she did, and she pondered how they obtained their calcium. She then made a mental note to conduct additional research later.</p>

<p>For the time being, she gave her visitor a snack while she tried to come up with something they could do. Unfortunately, she couldn’t come up with a topic to talk about and didn’t want to pressure Andrea into speaking. She decided to do something else instead, which is what teenagers are known for doing.</p>

<p>Rebekah switched on the TV and gave her visitor the option to choose the show she wanted to watch. Rebekah merely observed as she considered what the two could do next while leaning back on her couch. She hadn’t considered going to Archie’s arcade, which she knew would soon be in its downtime as teenagers went home for supper and then returned if they had homework, until it suddenly occurred to her.</p>

<p>She reasoned that they could go there when it’s peaceful and there are less people there. Before returning to the TV broadcast, which appeared to be a nature show, she glanced across to the clock and noted the time. When she turned back, the nature show in this instance concerned tigers. “aww! How adorable that newborn tiger was?” Rebekah said as she grinned and giggled at the tiger cub’s attempt to eat what appeared to be a watermelon. “Good kitten, take care of that harmful threat!” Andrea started laughing at what Rebekah said, which made Rebekah start to laugh as well.</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled as she watched Andrea laugh but she had to admit that it made her happy. The laughing signaled Andrea’s gradual emergence from her cocoon. “I’ve always been surprised by it, Observing how old animals are as they reach adulthood. “Rebekah nodded in agreement to what Andrea stated. “I must admit that I find it strange that a dog that is 15 years old is seen as elderly. It’s difficult to imagine that a dog would live in an old home if it were humanoid like humans.”</p>

<p>She told Andrea, although she didn’t share her feelings with her, that she was relieved she didn’t have a dog because she worried it would not be able to survive the transition from her house to the apartment since it would have been quite old. She did consider obtaining a dog when the subject of having a pet came up, if only as a friend, but given the way things were, she probably couldn’t care for one.</p>

<p>Rebekah found the information on how tigers nurtured their young intriguing and wondered what her life may have been like if she had been a tiger rather than a human girl while she and her companion watched the video. She attempted to come up with a fresh idea because she didn’t like how her life would have turned out, but Andrea’s presence diverted her attention.</p>

<p>“Hey, uh, t ... Thank you, even though I understand the reason for the job. Rebekah grinned at Andrea’s comment to her. “No problem; simply hanging around was enjoyable. Since I spend most of my time away from home at work and then get home late, virtually skipping supper, and barely have time for schoolwork, work doesn’t really allow that to happen.” Rebekah said and realized another idea.</p>

<p>“In regard to that, I was thinking about doing our homework with me if you had any, and then, if we finished early, visiting this arcade that I am familiar with. It is unlikely that anybody will be there because we will be at a time when teens are mostly returning home. What do you think? Rebekah asked.</p>

<p>As Andrea thought about it, Rebekah could see that Andrea was starting to think that it was a good idea. But Rebekah knew she wasn’t sure about the arcade part. Nevertheless the two turned the TV off and moved towards the table so that they could work on homework.</p>

<p>As they got going, Rebekah learned that Andrea had trouble with math. Rebekah didn’t blame her because a lot of people had trouble with math. However, she used it in her daily life and didn’t find it difficult. Rebekah took a time to assist Andrea with her math assignment, mostly by utilizing various explanations that she thought would make the material clearer to Andrea. The nudist teacher was glad to see that Andrea was beginning to comprehend her assignment.</p>

<p>Andrea also had less trouble with her math assignment because to Rebekah’s explanation and method. Rebekah wondered if she should enroll in a teaching course at the university after graduating from high school because she had been proud of Andrea and of her own teaching abilities. Unless she saved up her money to pay for it, she didn’t think that may be a smart idea. Andrea putting her math homework away brought Rebekah back to the present.</p>

<p>With much hesitation, Andrea hugged Rebekah and thanked her, “Thanks for helping me with that, Miss Teacher!” Andrea stated this with a smile on her face. Despite the fact that her face was so near Rebekah’s breasts. The fact that Rebekah could assist her with her assignments made her pleased.</p>

<p>While listening to Andrea concentrate on her own assignment, Rebekah quickly returned to her own work, albeit somewhat distracted. After listening to Andrea, Rebekah concentrated intensely and started working again immediately away. The two eventually did their homework, which was primarily mathematics rather than anything else.</p>

<p>Rebekah left her belongings where it was as the girls prepared to leave her apartment, but Andrea snatched her bag. The girls put their schoolwork in their bags. Outside, they came upon Alexandra, and Rebekah once more felt Andrea advancing behind her. Fortunately, Andrea’s fingers weren’t piercing Rebekah’s flesh, though. Rebekah greeted her neighbor, “Good afternoon, Alexandra,” with a smile. as she included, “How are you?” to her question before adding, “How’s Victor?” Victor and I both feel fine. He is going to steal you on Friday, just so you know. In fact, we’ve already made plans with his son at the moment.” Alexandra answered before Rebekah answered her with, “oooh, sounds mysterious,” and then reached behind her to hold Andrea’s hand.</p>

<p>who’s your friend behind you? Alexandra questioned, seeing the girl’s apparent shyness. “Her mother asked me to hang out with her; her name is Andrea.” She offered a brief explanation. “Before I brought her home, we were going to an arcade. Rebekah added on.</p>

<p>Alexandra grinned. “Andrea is a lovely name, but how will you two get to this arcade? Does she also ride a bike?” Rebekah shook her head when she was questioned. “Just me, I’m thinking we’ll take the bus because my bike is getting rusty and increasingly difficult to pedal.” Alexandra scowled in response to Rebekah’s comment. “Let’s go; I’ll drive you. Especially considering how you’re dressed, I don’t like the thought of you leaving on a bus alone by yourself.” Speaking as she turned and showed the way to the elevator, Alexandra said.</p>

<p>As she gently drew Andrea to her side, Rebekah grinned. “Alexandra is a lovely person. She won’t hurt you,” she said in a hushed voice to Andrea. Alexandra could hear her murmur which became evident by her grin. The kids followed Alexandra to her car once the elevator brought them to the parking area. Rebekah sensed something about Alexandra that she couldn’t quite put her finger on as being odd about her as they strolled.</p>

<p>Before she understood exactly what was different. You aren’t using the stick, are you? She inquired and observed Alexandra grinning in response. “Nope, it’s not as bad as it was before, so I don’t have to use it as much, which makes me happy.” The joyful news made Rebekah smile hearing that Alexandra was no longer in agony, made her happy.</p>

<p>As they got closer, Rebekah noticed the familiar car that Alexandra was driving, but she kept going after her.</p>

<p>The teenagers entered the rear seats as the doors were unlocked, and Alexandra sat in the driver’s seat as the car began to move. “So, an arcade, I think I understand our options. Many students frequent my little brother’s arcade, but I believe we can survive with the majority of them gone.” Alexandra murmured as she turned her attention to the road. Rebekah questioned how fast she typically rides her bike when the car headed to the streets as the girls observed the swiftly moving signs. Though her earlier remarks were still on her thoughts and deterring her, Rebekah turned her head to converse to Alexandra about some unimportant issues.</p>

<p>Rebekah and Andrea eventually saw they looked to be nearing a place named Archies Arcade as time went on, and when the car stopped, she knew this was where they were heading. They witnessed children leaving; some of them she recognized from school, others not. One person looked to have received a piggyback ride as they made their way to a car.</p>

<p>All three got out of the car as it was parked and made their way to the door. As Rebekah peered around and escorted Andrea gently inside, Andrea tried to slink behind her to avoid being seen. “sis!” As he walked out of the office in the rear, a man spoke up. Rebekah saw the familial resemblance as he approached Alexandra and they exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>Hello Archie, how are things going?” As she gave him a hug, Alexandra questioned. “Business has been booming, so well that I think I could open up shop somewhere else if I wanted to!” Archie said as he glanced to the teenagers and grinned. As he talked, to his sister he saw that one seemed to hide behind the other. “These your daughters?” He questioned Alexandra, who shook her head, “No, but...” Rebekah’s shoulders were softly covered by an arm that Alexandra moved to position. I adore this person as much as my kid.” She remarked, giving Rebekah a little squeeze that made her flush.</p>

<p>Rebekah was eventually released, and the teenagers walked toward one of the racing video games she had seen, Turbo Extreme Racing. The two were seated in a chair of some sort that was also a part of the game. Rebekah overheard Alexandra and Archie conversing as they were running. Rebekah was pleased with how Alexandra spoke about her throughout the portion of it that was about her. She was concerned about how her second job could come across to others.</p>

<p>She noticed a shadow enveloping her as Alexandra walked to the next seat adjacent to the teenagers and joined as another racer as the talk came to an end. Rebekah smiled as she made an innocent effort at some trash talking. “Alexandra, are you prepared to take second place?” Alexandra laughed when Rebekah asked her. She responded to the teenager in the nude, “Your adorable,” before Alexandra attempted to beat her by throwing her off the track. But she only managed to finish behind Andrea.</p>

<p>Archie eventually joined them because there was nothing to do in terms of maintenance or paperwork. As he did so, he made a statement about the times when nobody else was in the arcade. Alexandra questioned why he didn’t close up until the break ended after Andrea and Rebekah beat him in the race. Then they overheard him explain that before reacting to his defeat, he was thinking about the concept. “Note to self: avoid competing against nude program participants. Even if you are the owner, they will not allow you to win. Alexandra and Andrea responded with laughter at her poor brother, with a smug Rebekah.</p>

<p>Andrea eventually went from the racing chairs to one of the other games. In this one, she had to shoot a target with a bow and arrow. After following Andrea, Rebekah began observing her effort to reach the goal before focusing on her friend’s stance. She went forward after realizing where she was going wrong and caused Andrea to turn to look as she approached from behind. The bare naked teenager carefully moved Andrea’s arms before tapping Andrea’s lungs. “Breathe in here, and you’ll strike the mark.” Rebekah said, took a step back, and then watched as Andrea quickly struck her targets.</p>

<p>Rebekah sensed Alexandra behind her, and it appeared that she had also abandoned the racing seats. As a result of her advice to Andrea, she heard Alexandra’s words speak into her ear. Alexandra told Rebekah, “Good advice, honey.” The two then turned around to observe Andrea playing the bow and arrow game. Rebekah took a quick look around it before spotting what appeared to be the game’s title. She mumbled, “Super Archer Hero,” to herself.</p>

<p>She recalled an anime where a character who was an archer appeared as she gave the matter more attention. However, she thought that she was misremembering because in the show, the archer hadnt supported the main character who was wrongfully convicted of a crime. Before Alexandra and Rebekah started playing arbitrary games, Rebekah observed Andrea. Rebekah’s game asked her to take command of a huge King Kong creature and demolish structures. Due of the havoc and death she might wreak, the game most definitely wasn’t for young children.</p>

<p>A game that demanded exceptional hand-eye coordination was the one Alexandra randomly selected. Since Archie claimed to have received the game as a gift, neither of them knew the title of the game. Eventually, the time reached quarter past five. Alexandra came to the conclusion that they should probably take Andrea home. They said Archie farewell and then departed, getting into their car. “Andrea, where is your home?” The teen murmured in Rebekah’s ear in response to Alexandra’s question. Rebekah gave her the address, “1138 65th Avenue,” and soon they were moving. Rebekah requested if they could drop her off first since she believed Andrea would feel awkward without her present given how reserved she was.</p>

<p>Rebekah was grateful for Alexandra’s understanding so she agreed right away.</p>

<p>Rebekah went to Andrea and addressed her as they got back on the road. “I normally sit with the other program kids for lunch tomorrow. However, I’ll come get you tomorrow, and we may sit anywhere you choose.” she questioned before adding, “I don’t want you to be alone yourself or in danger though. Rebecca informed Andrea.</p>

<p>She was staring at Andrea, but out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Alexandra. As she fixed her attention on Rebekah and the road, Alexandra appeared to be grinning.</p>

<p>This enabled time to pass them by while the teens’ chat went on, finally resulting in their arrival at Andrea’s home. But Alexandra and Rebekah waited until Andrea entered the building before they departed. The teen’s move to the front seat was delayed as Alexandra waited. Once Rebekah was comfortable, Alexandra said, “I’m proud of you. You do your task without complaining, even adding things that your clients hadn’t considered.” She said before adding “I honestly speak for everyone in our building when I say this.”</p>

<p>Rebekah had gasped as Alexandra began to speak, but by the time Alexandra finished, Rebekah had just flushed. “Its ... It’s not a big thing, but I felt like I should conduct myself professionally.” While the car was still moving down the road, Rebekah told her in shock.</p>

<p>“So what’s this thing Victor is going to steal me for?” Rebekah asked, now that it was just the two of them. Alexandra smiled before she spoke. “He thought it was time you get your learner’s permit, and eventually your driver’s license, so you can upgrade from your bike, to something better.” Alexandra explained, causing Rebekah to widen her eyes in shock. “He also wanted to take you to see what vehicle you might want too.” Alexandra added.</p>

<p>When Rebekah realized she couldn’t talk due to shock, she quickly shut her mouth.” But I’m too young to get a learner’s permit, much less a driver’s license, don’t you think?” She questioned her, feeling really shocked by what they had even said. “To be honest, there can be exceptions, but you are now legally an adult because you were emancipated.” Rebekah was reminded by Alexandra of something she had no trouble recalling. She pondered the possibility that she ought to learn more about her limitations than she had before.</p>

<p>He wants to do it on Friday, so technically I’m no longer participating in the program.” Rebekah informed her as they quickly approached their building, “I don’t believe anybody has done it when they were nude, and certainly not the car shopping, so it seems like fun.” Rebekah moved to the door, held it open for Alexandra, and yawned as she got out of the car. The two then took the elevator together.</p>

<p>As they entered the elevator and leaned against the wall after pushing the floor button, Alexandra spoke to her nude companion, “Hehe, sounds like you’re experiencing new things that no one has before.” She said, “Yeah, lots of new things,” from Rebekah. “On Monday, I visited the Galley and a little store located between my high school and the neighboring school. Additionally, I visited the Crystal Glacier Center yesterday and traveled to the Skive Castle where I met Victor.” Rebecca informed her. Then she said, “I’m excited to see where I get sent next,” as the doors opened and the two walked out. The energetic teenager described her adventures and travels while Alexandra listened.</p>

<p>“Who knows, where you’ll go next, I’d love to hear about it after it happens.” Alexandra said as the two separated to go to their apartments.</p>

<p>On entering her apartment, she remembered that she had already finished her homework so she thought she’d watch TV, and try to transition to wearing clothes.</p>

<article id="C4">

<h2>Chapter 4: The Nudist at the Farm</h2>

<p>On that Thursday morning, Rebekah’s eyes opened somewhat excitedly. Thursday meant that today would be her second-to-last day of attending school nude and participating in naked adventures around the city. Even yet, the teenager had a sneaking suspicion that unless she could find a way to dress before entering the city, she’d still have to go to work tomorrow in her birthday suit. She doubted it, but she couldn’t help but think back to Alexandra’s statement of Victor telling her he intended to take her to acquire her driver’s license before looking for an upgrade for her bike.</p>

<p>This better would undoubtedly be a vehicle of some sort. Having a car, of course, meant there would be more space for the items she typically stows in the box behind her, and in particular, more space for passengers. Perhaps a truck would be preferable so she could have the extra room for any deliveries she might need to make.</p>

<p>She stopped making her breakfast as she considered the possibility of having passengers. She was aware that having a vehicle that could carry people would open up opportunities for her. She grinned as she returned to cooking breakfast and then delivered it to her table. Like yesterday, she continued to think about the events that happened yesterday as she was eating.</p>

<p>She might characterize the woman who had been her customer as either a Karen type or a narcissist. She wasn’t sure whether that was true, and because Andrea was so reserved, she couldn’t question her yesterday. Although she believed it was unlikely that the mother would call, she still intended to locate Andrea during lunch and sit with her. She only had to search and make use of what was perhaps the finest information and surveillance network on earth.</p>

<p>In fact, the principals were quite supportive of the Girls Basketball Captain and her best friends’ chat network by this point. Rebekah and many other former and present program participants were present on the network. Rebekah understood that all she had to do was identify the person she had been looking for, and they would tell her where they were.</p>

<p>After finishing her breakfast, Rebekah put the dishes in the dishwasher and clicked the necessary buttons. After taking a shower and changing into her birthday suit, she proceeded to her front doors before leaving her apartment. She continued to reflect on the events of yesterday and how her boss had called to congratulate her on a job well done after she had completed it. The fact that her customer hadn’t voiced any complaints about her made her grin. She performed the task as required and treated Andrea kindly. They had fun and she didn’t make her do anything she didn’t want to.</p>

<p>When her boss called to congratulate her on a job well done, she enjoyed the conversation. It implied that she performed well and was able to earn money, particularly with bonuses. However, she had spoken to her boss about Andrea’s mother and how concerned she was for both her mental and personality health. Mr. Bintott had stated that he would record that for future use. But Rebekah hoped that as a consequence of this, she wouldn’t cause any issues for Andrea.</p>

<p>As she exited the building, the light rendered her vision impaired, but she shifted her bag in order to get to her bike. As she continued to go, she brought her bag to the box at the rear of her bike and put it there. “Yes, a truck would be ideal. I could load the items I needed to deliver into the rear while keeping my bag safe in the cab.” She murmured as she shut the box, rose to her feet, and hopped aboard her bike.</p>

<p>After that, she rode to the high school she was presently attending and pondered the lunch menu.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time</b></p>

<p>Rebekah entered the cafeteria as the lunch bell rang at the high school and immediately began to look around. She noticed the program table, but she wasn’t searching for them; instead, she was trying to find Andrea, who she hadn’t yet seen. Up until she felt a tap on her arm, which caused Rebekah to turn around and quickly discover Andrea, who appeared to be uncomfortable. Before heading out to receive their dinner, Rebekah escorted her to the program table and introduced her to the other people.</p>

<p>Agnes had again been kind enough to leave her food, which today was a stir-fry from the previous commercial cooking lesson. She was aware that the stir-fry she was eating contained additional herbs, just like the food from yesterday. When the teenage woman left the school to go to work, she knew that these herbs would help keep her body cool. Although Rebekah appreciated the wait before the herbs began to operate, she didn’t believe she would have to perform the same tasks as yesterday.</p>

<p>Additionally, she was aware—or rather, she felt it instinctively—that today she would be around men. Based on how the week had progressed thus far, it appeared to be the way things operated. She placed Andrea’s meal on her tray after placing her stir-fry on it, then returned the tray and let Andrea take it. She then ate again while remaining silent. She and Andrea both kept quiet as the other students spoke.</p>

<p>She got through her meal and wiped her mouth before getting up from the table, leaving Andrea with her tray. She then proceeded with her backpack to the kitchen, passing the other women as she went by and waving to them. She spoke back, “Hiya, Ladies!” and began to make her way to the rear. Agnes followed closely after her and enquired, “No high noon today either?” She answered, “Nah, I figured you already heard it, so I didn’t have to say it again,” and Agnes laughed as she caressed the still nude teen’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Agnes and Rebekah soon parted ways as Rebekah shifted to lay her backpack down. Her hairnet and hairnet panties were taken out of the pouch in her backpack. The teen entered the bathroom, sat at the toilet, and then stood after putting her feet and legs through the openings in the “hairnet panties.” The string was felt between her butt cheeks as she drew it up and adjusted it over her privates. As she had done when she first began taking part in the program, and kept her job.</p>

<p>She walked back to where her apron hung on its hook and places her head through its loop at the top and then ties it around her waist at her back. Now that she was ready, she walked out of the bathroom doors and then to her station. She saw a rack, leaving the machine, and she pulled the now warm rack containing the trays with now clean dishes to the end of the metal so that one of the ladies could take them.</p>

<p>Rebekah then got another rack set up before she walked out into the cafeteria and went to the other bigger metal rack where the dirty trays were held and she took them back into the kitchen where she silently began putting the trays on the rack.</p>

<p>Rebekah continued to work, ignored by the other students who didn’t watch her as she stepped out.</p>

<p>She went back to her bag, and pulled her apron down after recalling that she had left it on the hook. She discreetly lowered it before slipping her head through the top loop and tying it around her waist at the back. When she was prepared, she went outside to her station. She noticed a rack leave the washing machine as she walked up to it, so she moved the now-warm rack with the trays of freshly cleaned dishes to the end of the metal so one of the women could take them.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s job was boring, but she didn’t complain about it, even though she wasn’t sure whether she could handle it after eight years of school. But she was confident that she would continue, carry out her job, and do it effectively.</p>

<p>After setting up a different rack, Rebekah entered the cafeteria and proceeded to the larger metal rack holding the filthy trays. She then brought the dirty trays back into the kitchen and discreetly started placing them on the rack. The other student disregarded Rebekah as she worked and paid no attention to her when she left the cafeteria.</p>

<p>She moved back and forth during the Lunch Hour, taking a rack, loading trays and dishes onto it, then running the racks through the washing machine. Once this was put through the machine, she switched back and grabbed one of the pointless racks to begin placing the utensils on them. Later, though, she realized that a tray was jutting out the incorrect direction, so she hit the machine’s stop button and raised its side to get access.</p>

<p>She muttered an expletive because she knew she had erred, just like she had on Monday, but she knew what to do.</p>

<p>As the machine’s hot steam billowed out, she took a step back before reaching inside, adjusting the tray so that it could fit, closing the lid, and turning the machine back on. She observed the rack carrying the freshly realigned tray pass through to the opposite side. “There we go,” she thought to herself before turning around once again and making her way back into the cafeteria. As she walked, she mumbled to herself, “Rebekah, be careful.”</p>

<p>She was aware that mistakes may create delays and that, if she wasn’t attentive, plates or water containers might get damaged.</p>

<p>She saw that there were fewer students on her subsequent walk outside to get the trays, but she didn’t dwell on it and went back to her desk. She understood that she would finish her task sooner after the kids had finished eating and had left the cafeteria. But occasionally, she would never finish before the fourth period bell rung.</p>

<p>Standing next to the machine once more, she recalled the itching that the fabric of the apron and the hairnet panties had given her. She didn’t itch from the apron this time, maybe because her body was accustomed to it. However, the hairnet pants were giving her an itch, so before returning to her job, she reached beneath and stroked the itch there.</p>

<p>She smiled as she stacked the three trays, brought them back into the kitchen, set them up in the racks, and gently guided them into the machine. She then moved to the other side and watched them come out. As she approached the tray return rack, she discovered that there were only three trays left. She also noticed that the cafeteria seating area was empty. She turned and proceeded to her backpack as she took off her apron and put it up on her hangar once they had exited without the trays becoming stuck. She allowed the ladies working in the kitchen to take the tray and the now-clean plates, before she turned and walked to her backpack, as she removed her apron and hung it up on her hangar. Once her apron was hung, she then removed both hairnets and places both in their place in the bag.</p>

<p><b>3:30 PM School’s End</b></p>

<p>Rebekah stopped as she was about to open the doors to answer her phone when it rang. She answered it, with “Helper’s Union Member, Rebekah, how may I help you?” hoping it came off as kind and professional. “Hello, my name is Flint Borealis.” The voice of a man remarked, “I’m the owner of Southridge Acres.” She immediately recognized that it was a farm because of the Acres in the company name. Although women have just begun to enter the farming industry, she was aware that it was still a male-dominated field.</p>

<p>“I apologize for calling at this time, but I need assistance today because one of my farm hands phoned in ill. I’ve heard that you are the only Helper who is readily available and I’ve also read positive reports about you.” Rebekah’s cheeks began to flush as Mister Borealis spoke. She had previously seen the evaluations, and each time it had made her embarrased. She felt she didn’t deserve the comments, which was a terrible aftereffect of her parents’ behavior. However, things started changing thanks to individuals like Alexandra, who lowered her parents’ influence.</p>

<p>“So have I, but basically what you’re saying is you need a replacement farm hand?” Rebekah asked. “Yes, that’s correct; would you be willing to help? This is farm work we are talking about, and you’d be among men, and I know from the reports you’re in the program.” He said before Rebekah replied. “It shouldn’t be a problem. I’ve gotten used to being naked in front of men while I worked, so as long as your employees behave I won’t mind working amongst them. And no matter my state of dress, sir, I’d like to stress I am willing to get my hands dirty and would be fine getting my body dirty if the accident happens.” She finished before adding, “I think I know where your farm is, it’s down Kent Road, right? “ She asked him.</p>

<p>He was a bit surprised by how certain she was and realized that her views had an impact on him as well. Of course, he was aware of how his followers would act. He was positive that the presence of a naked lady among them would serve as a test. “Yes.” After thanking her, he instructed her on which route to follow. He thanked her for her willingness to assist before hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>She merely grinned as she put her phone inside her purse, snatched up the large container of sunburn resistance lotion, and started applying it to her body. She called to the student, a male she remembered from her last class, as he was approaching the door. “Could you just do me a favor, Nick?” She questioned, grabbing his focus. He walked up to the naked girl and asked, “Sure, what’s up?” “Smear this thing on my back and the rest behind me,” she said as she gave the bottle to her classmate. “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to go home just yet,” she informed him.</p>

<p>He nodded, squeezed some cream onto his fingers, and started to delicately work it over her back and other difficult-to-reach areas. As the two of them labored diligently to apply the lotion to her body, Rebekah grinned at how kind Daniel was being to her. But when he finally reached the point where her back and her rear end connected, he didn’t stop, continuing to spread the cream there as well. Rebekah gasped as he touched the place where her back and bottom met, but she didn’t tell him to stop so she let him go. He smothered her with cream as they worked, covering every inch of her body.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Nick!” she said as she went out of the building and approached her bike, which was secured to the bike rack to prevent theft.</p>

<p>She took the chain off and put it in the box with her bag before getting back on her bike. She rode her bike out of the parking lot after backpedaling, as she usually did, to get away from the rack. She eventually arrived at the street that connected her neighborhood with her school. She quickly left the neighborhood and headed south, peddling as she felt the breeze touch her freshly applied creamed skin.</p>

<p>Her helmet began to feel loose as she rode, so she took advantage of the next red light to check that it was fastened before moving forward when the light turned green. She continued to keep her eyes fixed on the road and the signs indicating the speed limit. In contrast to Monday, she knew from experience that she wouldn’t be that fortunate as to be able to pass through the entire city without encountering any more red lights, so when there was one, she just laughed in enjoyment. As the automobiles on each side of her got into position, she was able to recognize them without even looking by smelling the gas they were burning.</p>

<p>While she waited, she had a look about and was able to see inside the automobiles on each side of her. She was further sidetracked by gas when she thought that if she had a truck, the stench would probably not bother her anymore. She was positive that this applied to both vehicles and trucks.</p>

<p>She realized her butt was in plain sight of them when she heard the sound of a car coming up behind her. She made no attempt to conceal herself, though, because a bike like hers made it useless to do so. She kept her gaze forward. Driving away from the bystanders, she took detours on back roads to get closer to her objective. She ultimately stopped her bike so she could look at her map and consider the instructions she had received. “Then, I’ll take Hercules Avenue West, and, Musk, and I am at the Galley, using it as a marker as He said, so I need to take that road, Yoda Street, which puts me into the center of downtown. and...”</p>

<p>Rebekah checked the map and figured out the directions. “Oh, left, left, straight, and then right, just like in the Crystal Glacier Lake Center, on Tuesday. That seems simple enough, hehe that Nintendo game must be well-liked, if people make directions like that.” Rebekah chuckles as she puts her phone back into her bag, and rode her bike once more.</p>

<p>As she cycled, she noticed a hospital rooftop ahead and wondered if it was a children’s or an adult hospital. Her question was quickly answered as she passed the sign indicating that it was an adult hospital because it didn’t specifically state that it was for children. She was confident that most hospitals had children’s wards, though.</p>

<p>She didn’t need to go to the hospital yet, so she shifted her attention away from it and carried on riding her bike. “The Farm is probably on a dirt road, so pedaling will probably be a little more challenging. Tomorrow my legs are going to burn.” She muttered to herself as she passed the hospital and the police stations on her route, but she had to halt when she saw the garage doors for the fire station open. There must be a fire someplace because the firefighters were sending their trucks and squad. Her phone’s alarms started to ring at that point, prompting her to check it.</p>

<p>She nearly shrieked “Apartment fire?!” before checking the link and seeing it was an apartment distant from her own, which made her feel better. She murmured “Damn it, those poor people” in an effort to express her sympathy for the fire victims.</p>

<p>She placed her phone back and sped off once again after remembering that she had to get to work. “I’d love to give the police and firefighters a gift, but they probably expect bad things in it, so I can’t.” She muttered to herself while frowning. She wanted she could compliment them on the excellent work they were doing, but she was content to merely state that everything was satisfactory.</p>

<p>As she approached the next road, it soon diverged off the main road and she rode her bike down a dirt road. This, she understood, indicated that she was quite near the farm that she was going to work on today. As she knew her bike could handle it as it was designed to, she continued on. She saw the names of the farms as she looked at the signs posted above the property borders. However, she had not yet arrived at Southridge Acres, so she rode over to the first man who was waiting for anything or simply taking a break on his fence.</p>

<p>Although he appeared astonished to find a nude girl there, he remained polite. “Hello, Miss. Can I assist you?” He asked. “Are Southridge Acres close by?” She asked, a little embarrassed. “Yes, you can’t miss it at the end of that road there.” She replied, then waved goodbye before starting to peddle her bike once again.</p>

<p>Her nose perked up as she inhaled the aroma and took in the absence of city and gas smells. She could smell fresh air as she moved forward. As she pedaled her bike down the dirt road, past the fields, and eventually arrived at South Ridge Acres, she thought it was fantastic to be in this setting. She thought to herself, “Nice place,” as she approached the property border. When he saw her, an elderly guy came out of the house. When he saw her naked body, he grinned, undoubtedly recognizing who she was. She could see his eyes examining her.</p>

<p>He moved swiftly towards that her direction. He inquired, “Hey, you Rebekah, right?” and she recognized his voice as coming from the caller and hence the client. “Yes, that is me.” As she gets off her bike, she says. He remarked to her, “ahh, good, let me introduce you to your temporary colleagues,” before walking her to the barn. He introduced each of the agricultural workers inside, saying, “Misters Burk, Wilson, and Bentshaft, this is Miss Elmstadter.” Each of them shook her hand and looked into her eyes as they did so. Flint led her to the chicken coop after that, where a guy was busy collecting eggs. “Miss Elmstadter in heres, Mr. Yolk,” Like the others in the barn, he too shook her hand and maintained his eyes on her face as Flint said, introducing her to him.</p>

<p>“All right, I believe I have finished introducing you to everyone. Why don’t you assist Mr. Yolk with the eggs here?” Rebekah had the opportunity to enter the chicken coop when Flint requested and moved aside. She had to agree that his last name was unusual, but she refrained from commenting as she gently removed the eggs. Instead, Rebekah posed an entirely new question when it occurred to her as Flint left them to it. “How many eggs are produced by the farm?” “On average, 31 million eggs a day, and in case you’re wondering, they’re sold at $3.66 per dozen,” Mister Yolk responded after a little period of silence.</p>

<p>He informed her, giving her time to comprehend what had been spoken. She handled the eggs with extreme care because they were delicate and placed them exactly where Mister Yolk asked her to. “When we’re finished, I’ll show how to identify when an egg will hatch into a chick or be used as food rather of responding to the other question.” he revealed. As her psychic companion brought up a new query she was beginning to have, Rebekah grinned.</p>

<p>Before they were finished, the two hustled and labored to get the eggs. Rebekah followed Mister Yolk as he moved behind the barn to another structure with the rack that contained the boxes on it. Here, he flipped on a light that, except from in one spot, didn’t appear to be particularly bright. He motioned for her to stand in that spot and said, “Come closer here.” She then noticed a new image behind the egg when he delicately raised it so the light could shine on it. “Oh wow, so that’s how?” She asked him “Yep, see this one, is going to be an egg we eat and this one ... Ah! he inquired. “Do you see?”</p>

<p>Rebekah was asked, and when she examined the egg more closely, she did see a difference from the first one. “That means that this egg will hatch into a chick, which will either grow up to be a hen or a rooster or will become food for us once it is fully grown. Of course, now that I think about it, we can always use another hen or rooster to produce more.” Mister Yolk gave her an explanation.</p>

<p>The two examined the eggs together to look for indications of viability for food or for chick development. The teenager estimated that the proportion appeared to be at 50% thus far. Despite the fact that this figure was probably too low for the entire nation, she didn’t want to consider mathematics in this situation. She was shocked by the following egg since the light approach did not work on it and it appeared to be heavier than the others. Rebekah turned to Mister Yolk and said, “There’s something wrong with this one.” She told him, and allowed him to look.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a double-shelled egg. Basically, it occurs when a second oocyte is produced by the ovary before the first egg has fully gone down the oviduct and been deposited. This is induced by a counter-peristaltic contraction”. As part of his explanation, he informs her that she “might find a lot of these in our eggs, but not too much.”</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded her head, but found another question related to eggs. “I’ve noticed a few of the yolk from the eggs were a different color.” She said and saw him nod.</p>

<p>“That happens because the color of the egg yolk is influenced directly by the chicken feed, mostly. It’s often yellow, especially the eggs we produce on the farm, because of the feed containing a large component of yellow, fat-soluble pigments, such as the carotenes in dark green plant material, for example, alfalfa. I want to stress, though, that though the emphasis is put on the color of the egg yolk. It doesn’t accurately reflect the nutritional value of an egg, and to some examples, some of the natural pigments that produce a rich yolk color are xanthophylls with little nutritional value, rather than the carotenoids that act as provitamin A in the body.”</p>

<p>“Also, a diet rich in vitamin A itself, but without A-provitamins or xanthophylls, can produce practically colorless yolks that are just as nutritious as any richly colored yolks.” He told her as he checked another egg, which didn’t show signs of chick development. “I should probably add, that Yolks, particularly from free-range eggs, can be of a wide range of colors, ranging from nearly white, through yellow and orange, to practically red, or even olive green, depending on the pigments in their feed. “ He told her.</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled and chuckled. “Just like that Doctor Suez story, green eggs, and ham. “ She said and she could hear him chuckle. “Yeah, that’s true, but I should mention the eggs we produce are all yellow, particularly because the owner, Mister Borealis, has a red-hue sensitivity in his eyes. I’ve seen him react, covering his eyes as if it was causing headaches. So we try not to produce that color. We also don’t try testing what specific hues are in red.”</p>

<p>Mister Yolk seemed happy to give her some knowledge about the eggs, which is why he continued. “Remember when I talked about the double-shelled eggs, there’s another version called the Double-yolk eggs, when an egg contains two or more yolks, occurs when ovulation occurs too rapidly, or when one yolk becomes joined with another yolk. “ Rebekah nodded, having remembered seeing that in the past, but then another question, had occurred to her. “Is it possible for eggs to have only whites, no yolks?” She asked him. He nodded his head again “Yup, that occurred during a Hen’s first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready. But it’s also possible, though rare, for mature hens too, as sometimes the tissues inside falls and her body doesn’t recognize it as tissue but thinks of it as another yolk.”</p>

<p>“Anyways, that’s enough egg knowledge, and this will likely take a bit, so why don’t you go find Mister Burk, and help him out, and send Mister Bentshaft over here?” He requested.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded as she cautiously moved away from Mister Yolk’s side, turned to look in the direction she was heading, and went outside. As the sun stung her eyes, she grimaced. She was met by Misters Burk and Bentshalf who approached her. Rebekah smiled at Mister Burk, “I was just coming over to get you,” he remarked. Rebekah pointed to Mister Bentshalf and said, “Yeah, Mister Yolk instructed me to go get you, and sent him over to help him.</p>

<p>Mr. Burk watched as Mr. Bentshaft entered with a nod. took her out of the farm’s egg section. As they approached the pigpen, a sizable herd of pigs was wallowing in the mud. “Do they really enjoy being in the mud like that?” She inquired while leaning on the fence to peer inside. “Yes,” Mr. Burk said, “And it actually keeps them cool, for like us, they are covered in skin, but unlike us, we can’t smear them in the sunburn resistance cream, for it causes problems for them unlike us.” Before adding, he clarified. “Even so, if they get trapped in the wallow, it might be hazardous.”</p>

<p>He commented as he focused on one of the pigs that appeared to be having trouble. “Which we may have to deal with,” he remarked as Rebekah, who had also seen the problematic pig, slid over the fence after removing her shoes and socks without thinking. When Mister Burk saw her flinging herself over the fence, he grabbed a shovel and said, “Whoa shit!”</p>

<p>“Miss Elmstadter, be careful in there now.” As he approached the gate, Mister Burk said as he was too large and ancient to have been flipped over the fence like she had been. Before acting, Rebekah awaited his entrance to the pig pen. “You’re not wearing anything, so enter and try to raise the pig up while I use the shovel to wedge him free.” Rebekah tried to lift the unfortunate trapped pig but found it difficult due to its weight as she knelt down and pushed her hands into the muck. When Mr. Burk carefully jammed the shovel, it ultimately helped to free the pig, which resulted in her falling back into the muck.</p>

<p>Mister Burk leaned out to grasp the muddy, nude teenager and lifted her out of the dirt as the released pig ran off to join its buddies and family. But he lifted the girl out of the pigpen and laid her down out of concern that she would become trapped. “Okay, let’s clean you up, and after that, we need to feed the pigs. We then need to get to the fields after keeping an eye out to ensure they don’t get trapped.” Mister Burk stated while taking her shoes and socks. Rebekah proceeded to the location where he indicated she might get washed up, </p>

<p>Rebekah grabbed the dial, turned it, and water started pouring out of the hose. She washed her hands and then looked at her feet. She questioned him as she cleansed herself, “What are we doing in the fields?” “Using the combine to harvest, I assume you don’t have a driver’s license yet, yeah?” Rebekah Replied, shaking her head. “No, however tomorrow my neighbor is taking me and a friend from her younger years to acquire the permits and license.” Rebekah confirmed for him.</p>

<p>“Okay, while I finish that, I’ll get you to help out in the pasture.” Mr. Burk remarked as the muck started to slide off her feet and then her butt. As he went to get a towel for her to use to dry herself off, he placed her shoes and socks on the ground. “The place where cows graze is a pasture, correct?” asked Rebecca. “Yup, we mostly need someone to go through it, collect cow poop, and take it to that building there,” Mister Burk said, pointing.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded, and she ultimately completed wiping the mud off of her before drying herself off. They then placed her shoes and socks back on in a one move. Rebekah responded, “Ok,” and Mister Burk led her to the area where they store cow excrement for easy transportation. She picked it up and put the gloves on before picking up a smaller shovel. She was guided by Mister Burk to her destination and shown what to look for.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>When Rebecca saw the cow manure, she crouched over and used the shovel to scoop it into the container. Mister Burk eventually left her to it, and she continued to hunt and scoop. She thought to herself, “This is the unusual one.” she thought to herself as she worked, “But, I’ve learned a lot today, possibly more than I did in school. Despite the fact that it was probably against the law for her to do so given the country’s rules, she had no intention of quitting school.</p>

<p>Rebekah noticed that some of the cow pies were greener than others as she worked, just like the yolk in an egg. These appeared to be further away from the wheat fields, so she wondered if it was brown for the grains or wheat they ate and green for the green vegetation.</p>

<p>“Hey, how ya doin’ over here?” asked the voice of Mister Bentshaft as he arrived. “doing well, Mister Burk, has me taking these cow waste, while he uses the combine over there.” Rebekah points him out with the shovel. “Ah, good, did he tell you what we use them for?’ He asked her, causing her to nod her head. “Yes, sir, he said mostly for fertilizer, which I know is used in planting, right?” she asked, and he nodded like she had. “That’s right, fertilizers are food for plants. Just as we need an adequate and consistent diet to grow and stay healthy, plants and crops have to get proper nutrition from the soil to thrive. Manure isn’t the only thing used. You might learn this in a gardening club or herbology, but plants require a balanced supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. As plants extract these nutrients from the soil during every growing season, they must be replenished through fertilizers, manure, and compost added to fields or gardens annually.” He said as he looked over the amount of manure she’d already collected.</p>

<p>“Know the advantage of using fertilizers?” He asked her just to see how limited her knowledge of gardening was. “Based on how extra it is, means it’s applied to control to match crop needs, and maybe protect the environment?” Rebekah asked him and saw the smile as he nodded, which showed that she was right.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s one advantage, but they can also supplement manure or compost to ensure the soil gets an adequate supply of nutrients.” Mister Bentshaft told her. “Alright, looks like the area is almost cleared. Once we’re done, we can let the cows out to graze. We’ve been slacking a little today; a horse and a cow are ready to give birth, so, me and the others want to be there, just in case help is required.” He said and confirmed that’s why two of the farmhands were in the barn when they met.</p>

<p>“So that’s why you and Mister Burk were in the Barn?” Rebekah asked him as she focused on her work. “yup, Mister Yolk is our egg specialist, he has a way with them, just knows how to take care of them, and I don’t believe we are superstitious, but every day that he’s here, we don’t have bad eggs, but when he’s gone, things get chaotic in there, hahaha.” He chuckled.</p>

<p>Without really wanting to accept that everything was actually chaotic, Rebekah merely grinned. The two of them ultimately gathered all of the cow pies, though. Someone had to perform the unpleasant task, though. The two returned to the barn and went inside after the pasture was free of cow waste. She then unlocked the pens and allowed all the cows out into the pasture. Bewildered by how quickly they could move, Rebecca watched them all leave.</p>

<p>The teen could see the pregnant cow. Rebekah saw how she appeared to be rising and falling, almost as though undecided. She also noticed potential restlessness symptoms, but she wasn’t sure if these were due to pain.</p>

<p>Getting up and down and seems a little restless or uncomfortable, and as she looked Mister Bentshaft leaned over to whisper into Rebekah’s ear. “Notice her tail raised and back arched like that? Oh, and see her attempts at straining? She’s pregnant and ready to give birth.” He said to her, and as Rebekah watched, she nodded, spotting the signs. “Is she going to give birth standing, like giraffes, or sit?” She asked him. “It depends on the cow. Some will have their babies standing up, but most of them will lie down. But we preferred standing since it’s safer for the calf.” He said.</p>

<p>Rebekah turned her attention to its appearance, and she noticed that her udder seemed to be packed with milk. She would then gasp as she saw the cow kicking her belly. “Oh, dear” she said, “Yeah, stomach pain is an unfortunate part. Our girl is going to go into labor soon. We’ve checked her out three times already, so probably any time might even happen after you leave us.” He told her, but he was watching her.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, he turned to Rebekah. “Hey, I need you to go and get the others, and fast, she’s about to give birth,” He told her. She nodded, and calmly so that it could be felt by the animals, she climbed down the fence and walked to where the other farm hands were. As she did, she glanced back at the cow, and saw something else, but she didn’t turn back. Thinking that she wouldn’t be of help and that she should leave it to the professionals, she returned to the egg building. “Gentlemen, Mister Bentshaft asked me to come to get you ... I think the pregnant cow is about to give birth.” She told the two of them. “Perfect timing, we’re about done in here too.” Mister Yolk said, and she returned to the fence, as the three men got to work</p>

<p>She sensed Mister Borealis approaching her side as she watched. “Oh, fantastic. The calf is on the way.” As he joined Rebekah, and kept her company, he said.</p>

<p>She could not see much, however, due to the farmhands in the way, but she dared not call and ask them to move out of respect for them. However, Mister Borealis appeared to be aware of what was happening and could tell that this wasn’t a breach delivery. He described the several births and how similar they were to human birth in a whisper to her ear. Rebekah eventually noticed a new calf when two of the three farm workers relocated. She also caught a glimpse of Mister Burk wriggling something in the animal’s nose.</p>

<p>“Why is Mister Burk washing the calf’s nose? germs and bacteria present from birth?” Mister Borealis was questioned by her. “No, it’s more to help it breathe. See, much like how we humans grow and develop in a special amniotic sac, inside of our mothers, for us, we get spanked, which finally gets us breathing, but for cows, it’s a lot different. We can’t simply spank the calf, we’ve had to do what Mister Burk just did, and see? the calf just sneezed on him, haha!” Rebekah grinned, trying hard not to laugh.</p>

<p>The three farm workers immediately transferred the calf, leaving the mother and her calf alone. The first to comment was Mister Burk, who said, “It’s a girl,” before informing Mister Borealis. He then turned to look at Rebekah, but because Flint was present, he presumed that their boss had already briefed her on the situation.</p>

<p>As he discovered the gender of the cow, Rebekah grinned. “The calf seemed adorable from here, but I assume we should now leave them alone?” She questioned the males in the area. Flint nodded as Mister Burk added, “Yeah, probably best, now it’s mother and baby time, time for them to bond, but we’ll check in on them just for medical reasons.”</p>

<p>Turning to Flint, Mr. Burk remarked. “I have the other people looking in on the horse, but if the cow’s is any indication, the horse will likely be the next,” said the Mister Burk. “My best guess is that it might happen even tomorrow, but we all know that biology doesn’t care about predictions and will likely take place when it wants to.” Before returning his focus to the teenager in a naked state, he notified his employer. Then he said to Miss Elmstadter, “I know you don’t have a license, but I’m going to take you with me, and show you how we deal with our fields, okay?”</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded and said, “Sure, sir, I’m interested.” She spoke those words before beginning to cross the fence in the same manner as he had. “Mister Bentshaft used the combine to harvest the wheat. I take it that what we’re doing right now is planting?” She questioned him. “Yes, plants are crucial even today, during these warmer months. To the extent we can, we attempt to finish it before winter.” As he led her to the machine’s storage facility, he told her. Since she had previously observed a neighboring combine outdoors, she was confident that it wasn’t inside.</p>

<p>However, she had never seen the machine that was revealed before. It appeared to be one of those plow-the-field machines as she traveled down its length, but there was new technology added to it in the form of what appeared to be a pipe attachment. Mister Burk was holding a big, weighty bag as she studied the machine. When she turned to look, she noticed something falling from the sack and recognized it was a seed.</p>

<p>Following Mister Burk, Rebekah watched as he tossed the bag over and the seeds inside fell down a chute before returning the bag to its original location. She waited next to the massive machine and circled it in an effort to get a better look. She stepped to the machine’s cabin and studied the controls, wondering just how it would work. Of course, she saw more than just the controls and the seats; she also saw how tiny the cab was. Although neither Mister Burk nor Rebekah were overweight, she was aware that if she were inside with him, he would actually elbow her, so she determined to be cautious so as not to draw attention to herself.</p>

<p>When Mister Burk came back, she turned to follow him to the machine’s ladder and ascended after him. He was waiting for her in a seat when she arrived there. “Are you okay with sitting there?” He asked, indicating the smaller seat to the left and behind. She observed that he was no longer donning the jacket that was attached to the item. Mister Burk took the belts out from the side and strapped her in after she nodded and sat down on the seat and jacket. She is informed by Mister Burk that “those might jiggle, I’m sorry about that” as he starts the vehicle and they leave the building.</p>

<p>She felt her breasts jiggle as the machine moved, just as Mister Burk had predicted it would. Rebekah raised her arms to attempt to stop this from happening rather than cover her breasts since she didn’t want the jiggling to draw attention to itself. She was able to glance about a little bit as a result, and she quickly saw the displays that displayed the entire machine as well as certain aspects of it. It turned out that the pipes she’d seen were really putting the seeds into the ground, but the plow sections were only making holes to put the seeds in, and then they’d be covered up when they were.</p>

<p>Rebekah observed as the machine followed the edge of the field up before moving along the edge of the plowed line they had already completed. She believed she would have had to shout her questions given how loud it was. “What percentage of these seeds must be planted? You once said that you made an effort to obtain as much as you could before winter.” Rebekah enquired with a stronger voice. Like she had, Mister Burk nodded, and like her, his voice was loud enough to be heard over the machine.</p>

<p>“It is advised that farmers like us sow between 1.2 and 2.2 million seeds of wheat per acre. The majority of the farms that grow only wheat are sizable, with several of them covering more than 600 hectares. Due of the poor production per hectare, they are forced to work in that scale. However, due to the size of those fields, the farmers are able to generate substantial profits.” Before adding any fresh information, he told her.</p>

<p>“As you can see, there is a significant dependence on machines for harvesting, planting, and other agricultural tasks like plowing. We are now planting and plowing, and after we are through, Mister Yolk or Mister Bentshaft will fly in to spray it.” She was informed by Mister Burk when the machine once more appeared next to the the line. “Now, for a fun fact. It is the oldest, most commonly grown, and most frequently consumed cereal crop in the world. Wheat is used to create starch, malt, dextrose, gluten, and alcohol in addition to flour, which is what bakers and parents used to make cakes and bread with. While learning new things—some of which she was already familiar with—Rebekah grinned.</p>

<p>As they were on the last line, they eventually finished using the machine. As soon as they reached the top, Mister Burk operated a lever and a switch, which caused the pipes to close and the plows to move upward and away from the ground below, as seen on the displays. He started the turn and took the vehicle towards storage as they saw from a window the combine being brought inside.</p>

<p>Rebekah looked down to adjust the seat belt after Mister Burk switched the machine off and there was a moment of stillness. She was the first to depart after being freed and descended the ladder. Mister Bentshaft was standing below her with his hands raised in case she slid and fell off. “Starch is a word that I’m acquainted with, but mostly because I’ve seen it used in relation to people who have diabetes. Aside from alcohol, the other words are unfamiliar to me, with the obvious exception of Gluton due to allergies.” As she down the ladder, she spoke to the two guys.</p>

<p>“Ah, so you were telling her about Wheat, then?” Mr. Bentshaft made a remark before adding. “In essence, it’s basic sugar, which may be produced from either wheat or corn.” He let her know. “Its chemical composition is the same as that of blood sugar, or glucose, which is a problem for diabetics. It is typically employed as a sweetener in baked products and is widely available in processed foods and corn syrup.” Rebekah’s arms were caught in his grasp as he helped her to her feet and said.</p>

<p>“Hospitals, Hospices, Rehab Centers and possibly Old Folks homes and Prison Hospitals also use it, as it’s dissolved in solutions that are given intravenously, which can be combined with other drugs, or used to increase a person’s blood sugar. For us, however, as it’s a simple sugar, our bodies can quickly use it for energy.” He said as he and Rebekah stepped back to allow Mister Burk to get to the ground. Mister Burk also added to Mister Bentshaft’s info by his own addition. “Remember how you said Starch is talked about in conjunction with diabetics? There are times, whether because diabetics gave themselves too much of their medication, or for no reason at all, their blood sugar, can go very low, which is very bad, see, normal blood sugar, is around 6, and anything below 4 is low, very low. So simple sugars can raise that up very quickly.” He tells her before adding. “Examples of other simple sugars include glucose, fructose, and galactose.”</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded as she learned. “So what are the chances I’ve been eating simple sugar and didn’t know it?” She asked them, thinking they’d know. “Well, products that are typically made of simple sugars include refined sugar, white pasta, and honey.” Mister Burk said, as the three began leaving the building. “Huh, so I have I mean I enjoy having honey with my waffles in the morning,” Rebekah said.</p>

<p>“As for Malt, you likely wouldn’t hear about it in school, and some products you don’t need to know about, like alcohol, which it can be used with, but some malt products are malt loaf, bagels, and Rich Tea biscuits, many cereals out there are malted but barley is the most common.” Mister Bentshaft explains as they entered the sun. Rebekah shifted her eyes before she got used to the light and then walked with them as normally. “Does Wheat have different coloring like rice?’ She asked them.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly, but for Wheat there are thousands of varieties, which are grown in two seasons. Those seasons are Winter, and Spring, Winter Wheat is planted in the fall and harvested in the summer. It needs a good root system and the beginnings of shoots before cold weather sets in. As for Spring Wheat, that’s planted in early spring, as soon as possible, and harvested in late summer. It’s also sometimes dormant seeded in late November or early December, when the ground is cold enough to inhibit germination until spring.” Mister Burk explained to her.</p>

<p>“Also Spring Wheat planting happens as soon as we can get our equipment in the field, but that usually happens at the end of March into April like now, for example.” Mister Bentshaft said before Mister Burk added, “the Soil temps should be around 36˚F to 40˚F for germination.” Rebekah remembered how warm the ground was when she walked it barefoot to get cleaned up from the pig stye. She realized she hadn’t checked the temperature, but she trusted them. She also realized that the fields must be at a different temperature than grass.</p>

<p>“So, now what’s next to work on?” Rebekah asked “oh, would it be possible to see how fertilizer is made?” Rebekah asked them, and immediately they made their way over to the machine that dealt with fertilizer production. As they walked, they saw Flint make his approach to them. ‘Hello Boss, we’re on our way to the Fertilizer machine, Miss Elmstadter wanted to see how that’s done,” Mister Burk told him. “Alright, sounds good, and an excellent learning opportunity.” He said as he followed the group to the machine.</p>

<p>She watched from where Flint was standing as Misters Burk and Bentshaft inserted the necessary components before the machine began to mash and combine them with everything that she had gathered.</p>

<p>She followed Flint as they watched the farmhands carrying the completed fertilizer out to the plants as they continued to stroll together. Here, she observed as they started incorporating it into the soil, thereby providing the plants with sustenance. When she turned to face the barn and saw the animals inside, she reflected on the lessons she had learnt from Mister Burk and questioned the size of the farm. The two farm workers eventually completed fertilizing the grass. She turned to look as they returned and noticed that they were gazing up at the sky.</p>

<p>She could see a big cloud to the south of her, but she couldn’t tell if it was followed by any more clouds. She was aware that farmers rely on rain to irrigate their crops, and in the event of a drought, they have hoses. However, she prayed that it would rain for them. “Okay, Mr. Bentshaft, would you please go fetch Mr. Yolk and bring him here?” Rebekah saw as Mister Bentshaft nodded and sprinted to where Mister Yolk was as Flint spoke. Rebekah was seized with worry as she pondered what might occur next.</p>

<p>Flint put his hand on Rebekah’s shoulder and spoke while Misters Bentshaft and Yolk joined Mister Burk at his side. Flint turned his attention to his employees and “Gentlemen, given the current legal environment and the regrettable fact that Miss Elmstadter is not my daughter, it is now time for us to say farewell to her. If she has any schoolwork, as well as for supper, she has to get home.” He spoke.</p>

<p>Mister Bentshaft stepped forward and shook her hand. “You are a good worker, brave and willing to get messy without complaint.” He said, followed by Mister Burk, who also shook his hand. “I enjoyed telling you about things and answering questions you may have,” Mister Yolk came next. “I enjoyed showing you how we took care of the eggs,” He said as he shook her hand. Flint was the last to shake her hand. “Thank you all, for the opportunity. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need help in the future, though hehe, I can promise I won’t be naked!” Rebekah said with a chuckle as they laughed.</p>

<p>After saying her goodbyes, she went back to her bike, took the lock off, and rode it home. Even though she was sure she could have stayed for lunch, she had the impression that it could be too much for them. She was a teenager in the nude, and they were adult men. Rebekah quickly turned her attention to the road and reversed her route from the farm until she arrived at the town. “I had learned a lot, but it was nice of them to compliment me,” I said, “but they didn’t have to do that.” As Rebekah felt her stomach growling, she whispered to herself.</p>

<p>She laughed as she reached the street where her flat was located and added, “I know ok, don’t worry, I’ll feed you!” Pizza, perhaps? Let’s do it, sure. She said as she turned toward the strip mall.</p>

<p>Once her bike was locked, she entered, grabbed her pizza (ham and pineapple), and sat down to eat it before heading home to do her schoolwork and fall asleep.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Nudist Delivery Girl and Licensed Driver</h2>

<p>On that particular Friday morning, Rebekah literally shrieked with joy when she awoke. The other day, Alexandra informed her about Victor’s statement that he intended to take Rebekah to acquire her driver’s license before going to look for something better, an upgrade for her bike. Naturally, a truck would be the improvement. Of course, having a vehicle meant there would be more capacity for both the items she typically packs in the box behind her and for passengers in particular. She was just thinking about what truck she would prefer for the most of the night. She most certainly wouldn’t be able to pick the colors because this would probably be a beginning truck rather than a personalized vehicle.</p>

<p>As she extended her arms, Rebekah yawned. “The sooner we go to school—and, I suppose, the sooner we’ll be finished—the better, so go wash your hands and have breakfast.” As she entered her kitchen to start preparing her breakfast, she thought to herself.</p>

<p>She finished preparing her breakfast and started eating it while she reflected on yesterday’s activities. She was given a job on a farm. Crop planting and shoveling cow dung had been taxing labor, but at last, she got to ride in a machine with someone else. It had been exciting work, but she had to confess that knowing more about their work and the products they made had been the most fascinating part of her time. Rebekah was pleased that she had the opportunity to learn new information that hadn’t been covered in class. Although she was convinced she could have learned it in a more complicated culinary class, she instead picked it up at the farm because she hadn’t yet registered in one.</p>

<p>But she couldn’t help but grin as she imagined the grades she’d earn in similar classes in the future when the teachers would ask questions and she’d raise her hand and provide the information they requested. Her grades would rise, raising her GPA as a result. Rebekah understood that the GPA was important since it was necessary for earning a graduation. Additionally, diplomas made it known to employers that a candidate had completed high school, which was a requirement for many jobs.</p>

<p>As Rebekah considered her good fortune, she put down her fork. Employees of the Helpers Union were not required to have a diploma. Since she joined as the newest member at the beginning of the year, she naturally understood that the helpers liked or didn’t even need to start school in order to work. When she first started working as a dishwasher, Rebekah recalled that she didn’t have one. She made the decision to do some study to find out what she required a certificate for when she had free time before or between jobs.</p>

<p>Rebekah finished her breakfast, then placed the plate into the dishwashing machine and pressed the appropriate buttons as she went for her shower, and now naked, she went to her front doors, before she exited her apartment. As she did, she thought further of things such as diplomas, and how they would help her, with the day’s events. Yesterday, her boss called to congratulate her on a job well done, which pleased her as she was happy she had done well, and especially in a place like the Farm. Rebekah had been pleased that Mister Borealis had no complaints about her work ethic.</p>

<p>Rebekah also found out that everyone of his ranch workers, including him, had been amazed by her fortitude and willingness to get dirty. Evidently, she earned their respect and admiration by diving into the pigsty and becoming dirty. She advised everyone in the Helpers Union to try working there at least once since not only had her experience and education been incredible, but the men had also behaved like genuine gentlemen. She was aware that having a girl working and moving about among all of those people while she was completely naked to their gaze would be uncomfortable for both of them as well as for her. She was aware that it would have an impact on other body components.</p>

<p>She was surprised by the light as she exited the building, but she chose to ignore it and instead changed her bag to provide her some cover as she walked to her bike. Since she quickly grew used to the sunshine, she continued to walk, bringing herself to the box at the rear of her bike and putting her backpack inside. “Good grades in school, congrats from the bosses. Yes, I agree that today would be perfect, just like every other day.” As she shut the box, made her way to the seat, and hopped on her bike, she said to herself. Then, as she traveled to her high school, she pondered the day’s lunch menu.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time</b></p>

<p>Rebekah entered the cafeteria as the lunch bell rang and she started to have a look around. She noticed the program table, but she wasn’t looking for them; rather, she was checking to see whether Andrea was there. She saw her right away and noticed how uncomfortable her dear friend was. They recalled Andrea from the day before as Rebekah brought her to the program table. She could thus remain there while Rebekah went to bring them lunch with no issues.</p>

<p>Like yesterday, Agnes had kindly left her food to eat, which today was Hamburgers and Fries, which was made by the previous commercial cooking class. Of course, she knew that like yesterday’s stir fry, the Hamburger Fry combo she was eating had extra herbs. The older woman who made it knew that the herbs would help keep Rebekah’s’ body cool once she left the school to go to work. Rebekah loved the delay effect for the herbs start, but she didn’t think she’d had to do the same work as yesterday.</p>

<p>She was confused by her instinctive feelings when she learned that Victor would be taking her to acquire her driver’s license. She was among males yesterday, but today, like on Monday and Wednesday, she would have normally been around women. On Monday, her client was Alexandra, her next-door neighbor, and on Tuesday, it was the men who worked at Skive Castle and Crystal Glacier Lake Center. Victor made it seem like things will be different today. Nevertheless, since she was a woman, Alexandra may show up.</p>

<p>Her hamburger and fries were now on her tray, along with Andrea’s meal. She gave Andrea her tray back and let her eat, this time remaining silent during the process. She and Andrea both kept quiet as the other students spoke.</p>

<p>She quickly completed her meal, wiped her mouth, and then stood up from the table, allowing Andrea to take care of her tray. She then walked with her backpack to the kitchen, passing the other women as she went by and waving to them. She replied verbally, “Hiya, Ladies!” and walked to the rear. Agnes called out as she walked along to Rebekah, “Hello Rebekah!” “So, today is your last day in the program, huh?” Agnes tacked on. “Yep,” said Rebecca, nodding. “I look forward to it.” Agnes laughed and caressed the teen’s shoulder as Rebekah remarked.</p>

<p>Agnes and Rebekah quickly parted ways as Rebekah put her backpack on the ground. Her hairnet and hairnet panties were taken out of the pouch in her backpack. The kid entered the restroom, sat at the toilet, and then stood after putting her feet and legs through the openings in the “hairnet panties.” The string was felt between her butt cheeks as she drew it up and adjusted it over her privates. She had noticed that it had been distracting her all week. “Oh yeah, I should return it because I won’t be nude next week.”</p>

<p>She walked back to where her apron hung on its hook and places her head through its loop at the top and then ties it around her waist at her back. Now that she was ready, she walked out of the bathroom doors and then to her station. She saw a rack, leaving the machine, and she pulled the now warm rack containing the trays with now clean dishes to the end of the metal so that one of the ladies could take them.</p>

<p>Rebekah then got another rack set up before she walked out into the cafeteria and went to the other bigger metal rack where the dirty trays were held and she took them back into the kitchen where she silently began putting the trays on the rack.</p>

<p>Rebekah continued to work, ignored by the other students who didn’t watch her as she stepped out.</p>

<p>She went back to her bag, and pulled her apron down after recalling that she had left it on the hook. She discreetly lowered it before slipping her head through the top loop and tying it around her waist at the back. When she was prepared, she went outside to her station. She noticed a rack leave the washing machine as she walked up to it, so she moved the now-warm rack with the trays of freshly cleaned dishes to the end of the metal so one of the women could take them.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s job was boring, but she didn’t complain about it, even though she wasn’t sure whether she could handle it after eight years of school. But she was confident that she would continue, carry out her job, and do it effectively.</p>

<p>After setting up a different rack, Rebekah entered the cafeteria and proceeded to the larger metal rack holding the filthy trays. She then brought the dirty trays back into the kitchen and discreetly started placing them on the rack. The other student disregarded Rebekah as she worked and paid no attention to her when she left the cafeteria.</p>

<p>She moved back and forth during the Lunch Hour, taking a rack, loading trays and dishes onto it, then running the racks through the washing machine. Once this was put through the machine, she switched back and grabbed one of the pointless racks to begin placing the utensils on them.</p>

<p>However, Agnes and the others arrived later and turned the appliance off. She observed as they opened its side to inspect the interior. They peered inside with a flashlight as hot steam billowed out of the machine. Then reached inside to make a correction. Agnes replied, “should be working fine, no more clanking noise,” which made Rebekah blink. She had been so preoccupied that she had missed the clanking sound. Rebekah turned around once again and started walking back into the cafeteria as Jody slid down the edge and reset the machine.</p>

<p>She saw that there were fewer students on her subsequent walk outside to get the trays, but she didn’t dwell on it and went back to her desk. She understood that she would finish her task sooner after the kids had finished eating and had left the cafeteria. But occasionally, she would never finish before the fourth period bell rung.</p>

<p>Standing next to the machine once more, she recalled the itching that the fabric of the apron and the hairnet panties had given her. She didn’t itch from the apron this time, maybe because her body was accustomed to it. However, the hairnet pants were giving her an itch, so before returning to her job, she reached beneath and stroked the itch there.</p>

<p>She smiled as she stacked the three trays, brought them back into the kitchen, set them up in the racks, and gently guided them into the machine. She then moved to the other side and watched them come out. As she approached the tray return rack, she discovered that there were only three trays left. She also noticed that the cafeteria seating area was empty. She turned and proceeded to her backpack as she took off her apron and put it up on her hangar once they had exited without the trays becoming stuck. She allowed the ladies working in the kitchen to take the tray and the now-clean plates, before she turned and walked to her backpack, as she removed her apron and hung it up on her hangar. Once her apron was hung, she then removed both hairnets and places both in their place in the bag.</p>

<p><b>3:30 PM School’s End</b></p>

<p>She recalled that her day’s work would probably involve spending time with her personally adopted grandfather, visiting the DMV, and obtaining her learner’s permit as she made her way to the door. Additionally, she was headed to a vehicle store and chose the truckitems she desired. Even while he was working with her on something she could use—getting her driver’s license—it wouldn’t exactly be considered a job. She assumed that meant that Mister Ben Bintott, her boss, would remove her from the active list. However, it wasn’t precisely what happened, at least not at first.</p>

<p>When her phone rang, she answered it nervously after seeing that it was her boss who was calling. She said, “What’s up, Big Brother?” and then overheard him chuckling. Although he was aware of her stubbornness and her tendency toward obstinacy, he discovered that he like her calling “big brother” and the thought of having a younger sister.</p>

<p>Rebekah loved the notion of having an older sister, so she hoped he did, at the very least. “Hey Rebekah, I’m sorry about this; I know you and Dad had something planned, but unfortunately I need you to go to the Galley once again. However, this time, you won’t be going inside; instead, you’ll be heading to the side of the building where some individuals will be placing items into the box. I will text you the addresses of various homes where I need you to deliver these products. But I don’t believe it will take you very long. I’m really sorry, sis.” She heard what he had said.</p>

<p>“Okay, then, I’ll head over to the galley, did dad say where we are supposed to meet after?” After hearing some papers rustle, Rebekah enquired. “Yes, he stated that you may meet at your residence.” Rebekah grinned as she heard Ben mention Victor was spending time with Alexandra. “Apparently he’s hanging with Alexandra for a bit,” he said. She answered to him, “All right, that sounds excellent. Then I’ll start going to the galley and starting making deliveries. Before being cut off, Rebekah spoke as she was getting ready to hang up. “Before you leave...” He made a start, then continued. “What do you think about Alexandra?”</p>

<p>She grinned in response to the query. “Alexandra, is one of the kindest individuals in the entire world. She is, in my opinion, the most perfect person for him of everyone I know.” Rebekah made the statement in favor of Alexandra. “Fantastic, thanks Rebekah. I value your opinions.” Before they hung up, he said.</p>

<p>Rebekah murmured to herself, “Alright, first things first, Sunburn resistance, then it’s to the road for me,” and she took the large bottle of sunburn resistance cream and started slathering it all over her body. As she was doing so, she heard someone approaching and realized it was Nick once again. When Nick saw her, he turned away from the entrance and moved in her direction. “You need assistance with your back, right?” She nodded in response when he questioned her. “Yup!” She spoke to him then, just like yesterday, squeezed some cream into his fingers, and then she turned so he could tend to her back once more.</p>

<p>She could feel it as he slowly started to glide it over her back and into tight spaces. As the two of them labored diligently to apply the cream to her body, she grinned in satisfaction at how sweet he was to her and how she felt. But when he finally reached the point where her back and her rear end connected, he didn’t stop, continuing to spread the cream there as well. As she finished before she was entirely coated in cream, she didn’t gasp in shock and instead allowed him continue. As she exited the building and made her way to her bike, which was secured to a bike rack by a lock, she remarked, “Thanks, Nick!”</p>

<p>She removed the chain and put it in the box with her bag before getting back on her bike. She backed away from the rack as she often did, and after that, she rode her bike out of the parking lot. She eventually arrived to the road that served both her school and the nearby neighborhoods. She quickly made her way out of the area to where she needed to be.</p>

<p>She took advantage of her first red light to check that her helmet was properly fastened on her head. She pedaled forward onto the streets after this was confirmed and the light turned green. Because she didn’t want to get into an accident, the adolescent rode her bike while keeping an eye on the posted speed limit. The teen’s attitude improved as she rode her bike ever-closer to the downtown area and thought about the truck she would purchase.</p>

<p>She became aware that this was the second red light she had experienced on prior trips to work when she passed the following light. Though she was aware that her luck wasn’t all that good, she had been fortunate enough to get through it this time. Vehicles positioned themselves on either side of her. The gas utilized by their automobiles was detectable to her. Although she focused more on the trucks and observed their appearance, she didn’t linger too long since she knew the trucks would all begin honking behind her.</p>

<p>She knew her butt would be in plain view, but she still continued. When she didn’t consider how to conceal herself, she recognized that she was accustomed to doing this and being exposed in public. She then considered whether to put this to her acceptance list on her account.</p>

<p>“Let’s check, Yoda Street is the route I need to follow in order to go to downtown; from there, I’ll take Hercules Avenue west, then Musk, and I will be there.” She spoke while she concentrated on remembering her way. She was well-versed in location placement because she had previously visited the Galley and other nearby locations on prior trips.</p>

<p>Despite being at yet another red light, she was fortunate to have a truck on her right side. Taking advantage of the chance, she asked the driver of the red and black car to roll down the window once she had caught his attention. “Hey, from where did you purchase the truck? I’m considering getting one.” He smiled when she spoke to him. The driver answered, “At Deez Trucks down on Brockroad, east of Yoda Street, ask for Ralph, he’s a good guy,” and with the change in light, the two parted ways.</p>

<p>She thought to herself, “Deez Trucks on Brick Road, east of Yoda Street,” and at the next red light, she checked it up on her phone. “Oh, the only one in town? Victor could take me there then” she speculated before putting her phone down and getting back on the road. When Rebekah saw the enormous supermarket in front of her, she thought to herself, “And there it is. She reduced the speed at which she pedaled so that she could move into the parking lot.</p>

<p>She recalled what Ben had told her once she was in the Galley parking lot and continued riding to the building’s side, where she came across a couple people she knew as other assistants. But unlike her, who was naked, the other members were all wearing short-sleeved shirts. She took her bag out of the box, slipped her arms through the arm straps, and tied a lower pair around her waist to keep it fastened to her as she came up, wondering if it would be in the way.</p>

<p>Similar to how the Galley staff members were shocked to find a naked person there on Monday, she saw that a few of them were also shocked to see a naked female there who they knew. As the Galley staff started loading products into boxes, behind bikes, or into trucks, she observed that those with trucks had much more items loaded than she and those who were similar to her had.</p>

<p>Since there were numerous items in the box and the bike jiggled when the weight was added, she believed she made the proper decision by taking her bag. She calculated silently in her brain while checking the systems on her bike to see how much weight was being added. Her gaze took in the appearance of the objects. None of them appeared to be too large for a girl her age. She was certain that she could lift them and move them where they needed to be.</p>

<p>When she checked her phone, she saw Ben’s message and read it, noting the locations. One had a unique directive allowing her to get into the pool if she so desired, she saw. Knowing how hot it was and would probably be while traveling, she felt that was nice and that the opportunity to cool off would be beneficial. She had lotion applied over her entire body to avoid sunburns. It did give some heat protection, but not complete protection, therefore cooling off was advised.</p>

<p>The location across from her apartment was the final one she needed to deliver the box to, therefore she was doing it last. “All right, uh, ma’am, the packages are there. You’re ready to go,” the employee remarked, and with a nod of her head, she reentered the road.</p>

<p>She stopped as she continued on her way after passing the hospital and the police station because the police cars were leaving the station with their sirens on. She couldn’t help but compare what she was seeing to police dramas like The Rookie and Chicago PD as she watched. She also recalled that they referred to the police car as their shop in the Rookie. She questioned whether such references existed in reality because she couldn’t recall hearing about them in Chicago PD. She thought about trying to their attention but refrained from doing so in order to avoid creating a distraction.</p>

<p>She kept riding her bike after all the cars had left, but she was forced to halt when the garage of the nearby fire station opened. She saw that the firefighters were sent teams to an unknown fire.</p>

<p>She remembered from the television program Chicago Fire that there was a team on the truck and a squad, which prompted her to wonder if Chicago Fire represented a genuine fire station or was it mostly intended for television. She watched an ambulance pass past, and her eyes blinked. “That reminds me of the show.” Before resuming her journey, she muttered to herself.</p>

<p>Rebekah quickly realized she had missed the turnoff to the fields, which led her to ponder how the Southridge Acres guys were faring. Since she hadn’t gotten a call, she reasoned that perhaps their replacement was just as competent as she had been. Eventually, Rebekah cleared her mind of her diversion and returned to her current duty.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>She followed the now-famous game’s instructions to go to the old left, left, straight, and right as she pedaled her bicycle. She followed these instructions from where she was and arrived at what seemed to be a suburban community. She noticed the grass and residences were both immaculate. “Sunny Lane, yes, that’s right, this is one of those wealthy neighborhoods.” As she moved forward, she mumbled to herself. till she arrived at the address indicated on her list. Rebekah muttered to herself, “Wet Paint, I guess I have to leave it on the steps, and yes, that’s exactly what the instructions say,” as she checked her phone and set the package on the stairs before getting back on her bike.</p>

<p>As she exited the area, she passed one of her coworkers who was delivering deliveries. As she rode out of the area, she mused to herself, “I wonder what it’s like living in a neighborhood like that. “Right, straight, left, and straight are the directions I must follow to get to my next destination.” She thought to herself as she rode through the highway, entering the loop that led to a different area after she followed the guidelines. She believed it to be another one of the wealthier areas, and based on the size of the houses, she was correct.</p>

<p>She was greeted as she approached by a man who seemed to be a butler and was wearing a suit. She questioned, but she didn’t give the idea any more thought. “May I help you?” He inquired in what she thought to be a dialect or a Jamaican accent, possibly. She got off her bike to get the parcel and added, “I have a package here for Velky Zadek.” She had no knowledge of Czech, thus she was ignorant that Velky Zadek, which would have been a strange name in that language, meant “Big Butt” in that language. Rebekah, however, was a polite young lady, so even if she were to know, she wouldn’t make fun of her name.</p>

<p>After taking the item out, Rebecca gave it to the man, who accepted it. Then she hopped back on her bike and rode off. She ignored the stares she got from the other locals and took the next route out of the neighborhood. She remembered that in the distant past, slaves had no clothing and were inferior to ordinary individuals. If that implied that she didn’t belong in their community because she was nude, she wondered. She quickly made the decision to banish these ideas from her head.</p>

<p>She turned to the closest curb she could locate as she approached the freeway to check her GPS. “I have to travel straight, straight again, right, right, then left before I get to the location where I will make my delivery.” As she rode off, going through the highway and mentally retaining the directions, she said to herself. She pondered what it would be like to ride in one of the trucks, vans, and semi-trucks she could see all around her. That’s when she recalled that a fellow program participant had remarked that she had once traveled with her uncle while he was working as a truck driver. Rebekah was aware that carrying passengers in a vehicle as large as those used for business purposes was prohibited. She questioned whether the girl was unique or something, or whether it may be her uncle’s job to transport her.</p>

<p>She recalled the youngster explaining that she had tragically lost her parents. When the conversation turned to parents, Rebekah put her feelings on hold and concentrated on her job. She was able to reach her next location thanks to her concentration. It appeared to be another suburban neighborhood, butShe wasn’t focusing on it; instead, she concentrated on the task at hand, which was to deliver her delivery. She knew she could set the package on the porch because the instructions made no mention of wet paint.</p>

<p>She examined the package’s name and noticed that there were really two of them for the residence. She then went for the other after picking up one and bringing it to the porch near the entrance. She observed the people around her and saw that they all seemed to be elderly, which led her to question whether this was a community for the elderly as she continued. Similar to the Skive Castle she’d visited on Wednesday, she waved and smiled at them, rang the doorbell, and then got back on her bike and cycled out of the area after making sure she hadn’t forgotten to deliver any packages.</p>

<p>She turned to the closest curb she could locate as she left the area once more in the hopes of utilizing her phone when she was permitted to do so legally. I need to turn right, then right again, then left, then left, then left again, then straight, and I’ll be there. As she checked the box, she muttered to herself. “Almost empty,” she said to herself as she observed the box’s gradually emptying contents. She could see vehicles and vans as the naked adolescent rode her bike around her. She didn’t spot any semi-trucks on the routes she travelled, unlike earlier, but she didn’t pay attention since she was too busy paying attention to the road.</p>

<p>Her ability to stay focused helped her go to her next location. She might have concentrated on that other suburban neighborhood, but she chose to concentrate on the task at hand, which was to deliver her delivery. She was certain that she could leave the package on the porch because the instruction didn’t reference wet paint in any way.</p>

<p>There were really two of them for the residence, according to the name on the package, which she verified. She then went for the other after picking up one and bringing it to the porch near the entrance. Observing the individuals around her, she saw that they all looked to be elderly, just like the area before. After making sure she didn’t have any gifts to deliver there, she gave them a kind grin, waved at them, rang the doorbell, got back on her bike, and cycled out of the area.</p>

<p>She proceeded out of the neighborhood with a smile on her face, heading for the closest curb where she could use her phone lawfully. “I need to travel straight and then straight again for four blocks, then three rights, and I’ll be there, I think.” As she checked the box, she muttered to herself. “Almost empty,” she said to herself as she observed the box’s gradually emptying contents. She could see vehicles and vans as the naked adolescent rode her bike around her. She didn’t spot any semi-trucks on the routes she travelled, unlike earlier, but she didn’t pay attention since she was too busy paying attention to the road.</p>

<p>She was able to reach her next location thanks to her continued focus. She didn’t concentrate on it; instead, she concentrated on the task at hand, which was to deliver her package, which was in another suburban neighborhood. She knew she could set the package on the porch because the instructions made no mention of wet paint. When she looked at the package’s name, she realized there were really three of them for the house. She took one, placed it on the porch near the entrance, and then went in search of the others. She saw that there were no vehicles in the area and reasoned that perhaps the residents were gone at work. She went back to her bike and checked the other items, seeing some were intended to be at the nearby homes. The driveway was also empty, so she reasoned that perhaps they weren’t home either.</p>

<p>As she pedaled to one end of the street and then the other, Rebekah kept quiet. She concentrated on her duties as she picked up items and set them next to the door. She then rode her bike to the next residence, reasoning that it would be simpler for the teenager to do so this time. especially when she carried the parcels to the doors as her backpack dug into her flesh. This was simpler since she believed it would be difficult to walk back to her bike to get the next delivery. She remembered one of the Helpers Union seniors telling her that making things easier was equally as essential as completing her job.</p>

<p>She reasoned that riding her bike, whatever small the distance, made things simpler for her. The teenager was feeling the heat of the day as she worked. Although it was a scorching day, the sunburn-resistance lotion helped to prevent her from getting burned. “Almost done,” she thought to herself as she examined and noted each parcel she had delivered before moving on to the next residence. She thought to herself, “Oh cool, it looks like they have a pool,” and as she looked to see which box she needed to deliver, she noticed they had also written that she was welcome to use the pool if she so desired. She grinned at that point.</p>

<p>She looked over the list and noticed that, after the delivery across the street from her apartment, this appeared to be the second-to-last delivery she had to make. This allowed her to take the backpack off, loosen the straps, and carefully place it into the box together with her shoes and socks. She secured her bike and walked up to the gate, opening it while entirely naked, down to her bare feet. “This appears to be very welcoming. I’m very pleased that they are allowing us to use the pool.”</p>

<p>Rebekah remembered an earlier assignment with the Helpers union that required her to enter a pool of water with a young child who was afraid of it while she traveled the length of the pool. To help the child overcome his or her fear, their parents progressively changed the water source from the sink to their tub and, last, to the pool. After a lot of effort, the child finally lost his fear of the water, and Rebekah showed him some enjoyable activities they could do with it, including splashing the kids’ parents.</p>

<p>She traversed the length of the diving board, her bare feet slapping first on the stairs and then the diving board. She pondered the current activities of the young man as she recalled that he would be around 13 years old.</p>

<p>She allowed herself to fall into the chilly water as her body tipped over and fell into its depths. The water’s coldness attacked her exposed, defenseless form as she did so. In order to prevent herself from going too deep, Rebekah surfaced once more. “It’s fantastic, It’s a shame that the building lacks a pool.” As she let herself to float, she said to herself. “However, there is one close by! Maybe that would be useful.” She asked herself as she closed her eyes and experienced the strange sensation of water flowing all around her. She also slightly extended her legs as if to allow water to penetrate her private areas. But she was aware of or believed that wouldn’t occur.</p>

<p>She reasoned that because water couldn’t penetrate her privates and butt, they behaved like those submarines as she swam to the ladders. She wasn’t sure, but she figured she’d check it out later. Water poured off of her shape as she exited, running down her belly, her butt, and between her legs. She could feel the water trickling down her legs as she fully exited the pool, made her way to the box, pulled a towel out of her bag to dry her hands, and wrote a letter on a piece of paper thanking the owner for allowing her use the pool.</p>

<p>To prevent water from leaking off it and to keep it away from her face, Rebekah slicked her hair back. She placed the towel back and closed the box before moving to the seat since she knew it would help her concentrate on the road. She noticed the reddish imprint left by the strap on her waist before sitting, particularly in the region just below her belly button. She scowled, but decided to leave it alone because it wasn’t hurting too much and wasn’t bleeding, so she got back on her bike and put on her helmet once again before riding out.</p>

<p>“To reach home, travel straight for about 10 blocks, turn right, go straight again for 10 blocks, turn left like in the original game, and finally turn right. For the 10 straight pathways, I might have to use the freeway, though.” Rebekah thought to herself as she started riding once again and quickly got on the highway. Here, she was mostly left alone, but shortly after, trucks started to encircle her, and after a few blocks, it was semi-trucks on either side of her. She stared at the enormous machinery around her and thought to herself, “Whoa, if these blow up, I’m doomed.”</p>

<p>She quickly gained separation from the vehicles in front of her, enabling her to continue on her course. She made an effort not to think about it, but the feeling of her body drying and her damp hair being fanned in this way was pleasant. She anticipated being able to put her shoes and socks back on as soon as her legs were dry enough, but she couldn’t help herself. Streets, taking care to observe all traffic regulations and signage. When she eventually arrived in a familiar location and saw her school, she knew she was getting close.</p>

<p>After turning onto a street, she quickly noticed her apartment and Victor standing next to Alexandra. She waved to them and grinned as she did so, then stopped to deliver the present across the street and walked her bike to the location she wanted. She proceeded to the rear to get the bike lock and said, “Hello!” to the two elderly people. “Why don’t you have your shoes or socks on?” Alexandra asked “Ben told me he needed to get you to help as part of a group, so you’d be late,” Victor said after Alexandra asked her question.</p>

<p>“I used the pool since the home before this one stated I could, so I did. That was very remarkable, and it was cool.”Rebekah said to the woman. Before she added “I was only in it for a few seconds because I knew I was needed here, We’ll go when I put on my shoes and socks.” She finished. Victor said, “Ok,” as Alexandra grinned at her. The two then watched as Rebekah put her socks and shoes back on.</p>

<p>Before returning to Victor’s side, she took her backpack out and had it delivered to her apartment via her mailbox. They were shortly escorted to Alexandra’s automobile, where they all entered. “So, you’ve decided what kind of car you want to drive?” questioned Alexandra, Rebekah nodded and before responding. “A truck, yes. I thought that it would probably be better for me and my job in particular. Victor chuckled as she heard Rebekah say, “I figured you’d say that, Most teens would want a Ferrari, or another fast car, but you thought about what you needed and went with that,” Victor added.</p>

<p>“I figured that having a fast car would enhance my reputation, but I don’t require that. There is still time for reputation improvements, but a truck that is considerably better would be much more helpful for my job. Another factor in my decision to go with the truck was that it would have a larger box than I did and be able to carry more.” As soon as Rebekah said that, Alexandra exclaimed, “That’s my girl!” As they quickly got at the DMV, Rebekah grinned as the three of them went to the front and informed the receptionist that she was an emancipated adolescent but that the other two were vouching for her.</p>

<p>The woman at the counter gave Rebekah the exam and instructed her to go to a room where no one would interrupt her after seeing her Helper’s Union card. She saw the lady staring at her breasts as she made her way to the room, but because she wanted to concentrate on the test, she wiped the memory from her mind. As she entered the room, the commotion from outside became muffled. She then moved right away to the center table after spotting a pencil there. “Convenient, all right, Rebekah, this is an important test more important than the others in school. Don’t worry; we can pass this test.” She said as she took a seat on the toweled seat.</p>

<p>“Question one To stop your car from skidding, you should first, Aey, Keep your course straight. Bee, veer off to the side opposite the skid., Cee, go in the desired direction, or Dee, Set the brakes firmly.” She thought to herself as she reclined in her chair.</p>

<p>“I remember an incident like this ... Now, how did I do it? Oh, I remained calm and Steered in the direction where I wanted to go, so Cee. “ She said, marking the letter down. “Question two, when may you lend your driver’s license?” She felt she had to blink her eyes. “This one’s an easy answer. It’s C, it’s your driver’s license, and I don’t think it identifies you, so C definitely.” She said to herself, before reading the next question. “Question Three, what must a driver do before entering a highway from a private road or driveway?” Rebekah smirked and marked down B for her answer.</p>

<p>“These are pretty easy, I was actually scared, but then, I’ve been on the road with my bike. So that probably helped. “Question Four, never change lanes in traffic without ... Oh, this one I’m familiar with, since I do it automatically.” She said to herself and marked B again. “Five, When the driver of another vehicle is about to overtake and pass your vehicle, you must...” She immediately marked D for this question, she’d done that constantly, especially since vehicles can easily kill her if she or they weren’t too careful.</p>

<p>“Alright Sixth question, When you are deciding whether or not to make a U-turn, your first consideration should be to check ... Oh Traffic regulations yeah, so...” she said as she marked A for this question. “Seventh question, oh this one and one more and we’d be done!” Rebekah said as she felt her excitement. “Anyways Seventh question, 7. It is more dangerous to drive at the maximum speed limit at night than during daytime as...” Rebekah immediately marked B “I’ve been out on those roads at night, and if it wasn’t for Alexandra, I’d have been lost that one time.” She said to herself. “Last question, you should, under all conditions, drive at a speed which will allow you to...” She immediately marked D for this one.</p>

<p>After gathering everything, making sure everything was safe, depositing it where she needed to, and declaring, “Okay, I think I’m done,” she went in search of Victor and Alexandra. She quickly located Alexandra and sat down next to her. “How did the test go, Victor needed to go to the bathroom. I assume so given how soon you arrived here. It was easy?” She asked her.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded ‘Yeah fairly easy, I mean I was already used to it while on my bike, so I guess that helped a lot.” She said to the older woman. “Awesome!, By the way, I just remembered, Ben told us what you said about me, I’m grateful you think so!” she said, and the two hugged, neither cared that one was naked and the other wasn’t. “it’s all true, ever since I came to live in my apartment you were kind to me. You deserve a chance at love, and so does Victor.” She said to the older woman, who soon began getting up. “Anyways, I need to get going, I have some errands to run, and I need to make sure there is money transferred to your account too!” Alexandra said, and the two hugged again before she left.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Victor and the proctor who had given her the driver’s license joined the nude teen. Both Victor and Alexandra were grateful for her words. The proctor mentioned that she was allowed to pass and just needed to do the test because of her job.</p>

<p>Together with Rebekah, who understood what was happening, Victor was grinning while this was happening. She wouldn’t require a passenger in the vehicle. She then placed her license in her purse that Alexandra had given her before the two of them left the DMV. “While I was on the road, I asked this truck driver where he acquired his truck, and he answered Deez Trucks, which it turned out was the only truck store in town.” Rebekah said, “Ah, it makes sense, and I know precisely the person who might be able to assist us.” Victor said as the two proceeded to the bus station and boarded the bus that would take them to Yoda Street. “I’ve always wondered why Yoda Street was given that name. Was the Star Wars character named after a street or something else, according to Mr. Lucas? Victor was asked by Rebecca.</p>

<p>I mean, the tiny man is fairly amazing, but the person who built the neighborhood simply had to bug the committee into giving it the name because he loved the Star Wars Character. He moves like a youthful man while being so elderly. Victor remarked.</p>

<p>As they rode the bus, she grinned and remarked, “True, he is a cool little guy! “ She could feel her breasts jiggle with the motion of the bus. “who is capable of handling vile criminals”. Victor was told by her. Before getting off the ship, the old guy and the nude teenager entered the truck dealership. “Billy, my man!” In front of them, Victor beckoned to another man. “This young lady here needs a truck,” Victor concluded. “You’ve come to the right place,” Billy remarked. “I assume that this is her first.” Victor nodded in response to his question. “Yup!” Billy smiled. “Great, we have the appropriate truck for you right here! Come on over here.”</p>

<p>As he walked them to the chosen truck, he said. Rebekah circled the vehicle, noting the back, the wheels, and the engine before nodding, “I like it, especially the colors,” and Victor handed over the credit card, which was used to make the purchase right away. With her keys in hand, Rebekah unlocked the door and stepped inside, while Victor walked in through the passenger door.</p>

<p>Off the lot, they moved the truck. She’d exclaim when they returned to the apartment, where Alexandra awaited them, “This is so cool!” Evidently, the task at hand was to register for her new allotted spot. Both of them received hugs from her as she grinned at her truck and expressed her gratitude for their assistance. This was very incredible and will help her job immensely.</p>

<p>She was aware that she wouldn’t need to use the sunburn protection lotion now that she was indoors. She gave the two adults one last embrace before going in to get her homework, remembering that she had it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>When Rebekah Elmstadter woke up that Saturday morning, the teenager smiled. Yesterday had been a busy day, making deliveries using only her bike, which had been a very difficult task to accomplish, and then she met up with Victor Bintott. The old man she met on Tuesday and subsequently adopted as her father, though this was in name only since they hadn’t signed any papers. But yesterday, Victor and her neighbor Alexandra had taken her to the DMV where she formally got her driver’s license, and then the old man and naked teen separated from Alexandra as Alexandra had an “errand to run” which it turns out was to get her new parking space properly signed. Victor took her to the truck store, named Deez Trucks, to help buy Rebekah a truck.</p>

<p>She was so glad she now had a truck instead of a bike because she knew it would be useful to her, much more useful than her bike had been. She also knew her truck would be safer for her while on the road in winter time especially. As Rebekah passed the windows of her apartment, she looked down towards her truck and smiled. She couldn’t wait to take it for a drive, but first, it was breakfast time, and then she’d activate her name on the Helpers Union app. This would show she was ready to help others, which it had every 3:30 p.m. during the weekday. On Weekends, she had to do it manually, as it wouldn’t activate if she didn’t.</p>

<p>Rebekah was especially excited since she had left the part that listed her as being willing to be naked in a non-sexual way. The week therefore had not been so bad, so she kind of wanted to continue it, though she wouldn’t be able to do any outreach for the Program.</p>

<p>Rebekah considered whether to sign up for the App as she made her way to the kitchenette and began preparing breakfast. She was aware that activating would result in payment. If not, she would receive a two-day vacation. The teen’s waffles sprang out of the toaster and she put them right on her plate.</p>

<p>She filled a glass with milk, ate her waffles, which she had quickly spread with jam, and finished her meal. While she was eating, she drew her phone closer and signed into the app to start receiving work for the day. But when she saw herself featured on the app, complete with her unique quality—her willingness to be nude in a non-sexual way—she grinned.</p>

<p>Rebekah hoped that her choice would help her stand out among the other helpers. As she got dressed and prepared for the day, her phone buzzed with a notification. A request had come in. It was from a local artist named Lila who needed a model for her new project. Rebekah immediately accepted the job, her heart racing with excitement.</p>

<p>After getting into her truck, she headed down to the art studio and parked her new truck. Rebekah made her way to where Lila’s studio was, and on entering, she saw that the studio was filled with canvases, sculptures, and a variety of art supplies. Then there was the owner herself, who turned at the sound of the creaking door. “Rebekah, right?’ Lila asked her, and Rebekah nodded, “yup, that’s me” Rebekah replied. Lila smiled and showed her the indicated seat. “So my vision for my art project is, a series, on body-positive nude portraits, and more typically, non-sexual, to challenge traditional beauty standards.” Lila explained to her new model, and Rebekah smiled, feeling like she was more than happy to do it, as she felt empowered to do so. “ok,” she said to the artist, and took her clothes off, showing off the tan that had emerged after a week of being naked outside.</p>

<p>Rebekah couldn’t help but smile as she saw Lila’s reaction and then posed for the artist in front of her. She’d had to adjust her pose a few times when the pose she’d chosen wasn’t good enough for the artist. Rebekah was allowed breaks, including water and bathroom breaks, as the time with Lila had been spent. The experience was liberating, and Rebekah admired the artistry of it all as the time went on by. The session lasted for a few hours, and Rebekah felt a deep connection with both the art and the artist, mainly through her gratitude for the artist letting her try new things while she was naked.</p>

<p>Once the session was over, Lila thanked Rebekah and promised to share the final pieces with her when they were complete. After getting dressed, Rebekah left the studio with a sense of fulfillment, knowing she had contributed to something meaningful. Getting into her truck, she thought about how the start of her day went, and wondered what other surprises and adventures awaited her on this beautiful Saturday.</p>

<p>The teenager checked the time and saw that it was lunch, so she drove her truck to Cluck-Cluck World, which sold the best food of the entire city’s restaurants. Rebekah parked her truck outside Cluck-Cluck World, a place she realized she’d never gone. The prospect of a discount for naked customers intrigued her, and desiring to continue with her experiment, she stripped nude once more and moved towards the entrance, though she couldn’t help but wonder if she was perhaps odd, with how she wanted to be naked again. “We should book an appointment with a doctor next,” she said, chuckling.</p>

<p>As she walked into the restaurant, the delicious aroma of fried chicken and other mouthwatering dishes greeted her. The atmosphere was lively, with families and friends enjoying their meals. She noticed that the staff treated her warmly, utterly nonchalant about her state of undress.</p>

<p>Rebekah approached the counter and placed her order. The cashier smiled and confirmed her discount, which she appreciated. She then found a seat by the window, where she could enjoy her meal and the cozy ambiance of the place. She watched people go about their day, and it was clear that MC Cluck-Cluck World was a popular spot in town.</p>

<p>After relishing her meal, she chose to start a conversation with a fellow diner at a nearby table, interested in finding out more about this popular local place and the people who come here often. She soon found herself engaged in a lively discussion about the city, its quirks, and its welcoming community.</p>

<p>Rebekah finished her meal and said goodbye to her new acquaintance, and at that moment, she recognized how her lack of an outfit had brought about a day full of unexpected connections and adventures. She was eager to see what else this vibrant city had in store for her as she continued her day.</p>

<p>Since Lila had labeled her work with Rebekah as finished, Rebekah soon felt a buzz of her phone, signaling the start of a new job. So she looked and saw that it came from Archie, one that was familiar as he was Alexandra’s brother. She remembered Alexandra telling her he’d opened a special adult comic book store. Most of the comics weren’t for little kids, though some were. She thought about walking in there and working while she was naked. Her thoughts were refocused on the request, which was for an assistant, and that her job entailed that she’d need to make sure the comics were in order, and surfaces were cleaned. She also saw that Archie had said that if she were naked, it would bring in more customers.</p>

<p>Rebekah couldn’t help but grin as she read Archie’s message and thought that working at an adult comic book store while being naked was an intriguing proposal. She quickly accepted the job request and made her way to Archie’s store.</p>

<p>The comic book store was a treasure trove of graphic novels, comics, and collectibles for mature readers. As she entered, Archie hurried towards her with a smile on his face. “Hey Rebekah, I’m glad you’re here!” He told her, as he hugged the nude girl. “So, like I said in my message, your job is to make sure the comics were in order and surfaces were cleaned. They should be up here, but can’t be too careful, because the previous owner didn’t bother to clean the place, though.” Archie told her. Rebekah nodded her head. “soo ... Archie ... comics huh?” she asked with a new smile on her face, and Archie chuckled before Rebekah enthusiastically got to work, organizing the comics on the shelves, dusting off surfaces, and ensuring the store was presentable.</p>

<p>She couldn’t help but notice the strange looks from customers as she went about her duties; they were obviously taken aback by her naked state. While some customers were startled, others simply went about their business and enjoyed the distinctive atmosphere of the shop.</p>

<p>Archie’s idea of having a naked assistant indeed seemed to draw in more customers, though few were adults, and Rebekah found herself engaged in interesting conversations about comics and graphic novels. She was learning more about the world of adult comics and the niche community that cherished them.</p>

<p>As the day went on, Rebekah felt a sense of fulfillment, knowing that her willingness to embrace her nudity had allowed her to connect with people from various walks of life. She continued to assist Archie and interact with customers, making her presence a memorable part of their visit to the store.</p>

<p>However, the teen knew that the work she had to do for Archie wasn’t finished, and she decided to take a chance. The naked woman went up to an old man, who appeared to be having trouble making a choice. “May I help you with anything?” She asked him politely, and as he turned, he saw her, a naked woman in front of him, her beautiful breasts on display. “y yes, I need help deciding on what to get my niece and her wife. They mentioned an interest in comic books like these to spice up their lives, but I don’t know which is good. “ He said and Rebekah looked over his choices, before “Oh that one’s good!” she said.</p>

<p>Rebekah could sense the old man’s initial surprise at her appearance, but as they started discussing comic book options, her knowledge and enthusiasm instantly won him over. Her genuine interest in helping him find a suitable gift for his niece and her wife made the interaction feel perfectly normal.</p>

<p>As they browsed through the comic book selections, Rebekah shared her insights on different titles, explaining their themes, art styles, and target audiences. The old man listened carefully, appreciating her guidance. After some thoughtful consideration and a pleasant conversation, he settled on a couple of comic books that he thought would be perfect for his niece and her wife. With a grateful smile, he thanked Rebekah for her assistance.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s willingness to engage with customers and provide helpful recommendations, despite her nudity, not only ensured the old man left the store with a thoughtful gift but also added another layer of intrigue to her day. She continued assisting Archie, cherishing the memorable interactions she had with the customers who frequented the store.</p>

<p>As Rebekah walked back to Archie, a hand snuck under her left breast to scratch an itch she had there. Still surprised Archie had bought the place from its previous owner, she had felt thrilled to be able to help Archie at his comic book store. She returned to Archie with a sense of fulfillment after helping the old man choose comic books. She enjoyed assisting at the comic book store. It made her wonder about some things, though her thoughts left her as Archie spoke to her.</p>

<p>Archie noticed her cheerful demeanor and said, “You know, Rebekah, I’m really glad I bought this place from the previous owner. It’s also been great having you here to help out. I think you bring a unique thing to the store that I think customers appreciate.”</p>

<p>Rebekah’s smile widened as she responded, “I’m just happy to be part of it, Archie. It’s been an exciting day so far, and I’m looking forward to more adventures like this.” As she continued assisting Archie and interacting with customers, Rebekah’s presence continued to make the comic book store a memorable and unique place for those who frequented it.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s heart skipped a beat as Andrea walked into the comic book store. Her presence was a surprise to the teenager, as she knew Andrea was shy. Plus, Rebekah had to admit, she liked her, though she couldn’t tell if she had a crush on her or not. The unexpected encounter left her feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.</p>

<p>“Hey, Andrea,” Rebekah greeted her, trying to maintain her composure and professionalism, despite her nude state. “Can I get you anything?” Andrea’s eyes widened with surprise, but she quickly composed herself and offered a warm smile. “Hey Rebekah, I’m surprised to see you here, and naked, too, I thought your week ended? As for me, I’m just here to browse and maybe pick up a few comics. But wow, you certainly bring a unique touch to the Comic Book Store,” she said with an almost smile.</p>

<p>Rebekah chuckled, grateful for Andrea’s understanding and how she seemed to be getting over her shyness. As she continued assisting other customers, she couldn’t help but steal glances in Andrea’s direction, hoping that their reunion might lead to more exciting adventures in the future. As Rebekah went about her tasks in the comic book store, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of curiosity about Andrea. Unbeknownst to her, Andrea had also been stealing glances in her direction.</p>

<p>Andrea’s quick glance and subsequent shyness didn’t go unnoticed by Rebekah for long, and it left her with a fluttering feeling of excitement. While they both tried to play it cool and focus on their respective activities, there was an undeniable spark of interest in the air. Rebekah continued assisting customers, all the while wondering if this unexpected reunion with Andrea might lead to an opportunity to catch up and explore the potential for something more in the future. The day was proving to be full of surprises, and Rebekah couldn’t wait to see where it would take her next.</p>

<p>Andrea steeled her resolve before she made her way to Rebekah. “I’d like to buy these, and ... would you be willing to come to my house, naked?” She asked with a blush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>Andrea’s invitation pleasantly surprised Rebekah. The blush on her cheeks added a touch of charm to her words. Rebekah considered the offer for a moment and replied with a warm smile, “I’d love to join you, Andrea.”</p>

<p>They exchanged contact information, and Andrea paid for her comics. Rebekah’s heart raced with excitement as she contemplated the new adventure that awaited her outside of the comic book store.</p>

<p>Rebekah continued her work at the comic book store with a contented smile, knowing she had an exciting plan to visit Andrea later in the day. The prospect of being with Andrea in a unique setting intrigued her, and she noticed Andrea appeared more at ease in her presence without the constraints of clothing, which added an element of curiosity about their upcoming meeting.</p>

<p>The hours passed, and Rebekah’s mind was occupied with anticipation. She couldn’t wait for her shift to end so she could embark on this new adventure with Andrea, cherishing the interesting twists her life had taken recently. The prospect of the evening with Andrea brought an air of enchantment to her day, and she couldn’t help but daydream about the possibilities.</p>

<p>“Hey,” Archie said, shaking Rebekah out of her daydream. “Could I get you to go into the basement? We need to refill a few of the shelves with comics, and you might have to blow on it to get the dust off.” Rebekah nodded and turned and walked to the staff door, then after entering it, she went to the doors marked basement, and walked down. As she descended into the basement, she noticed the dirt and dust that had accumulated but didn’t mind, though she thought of asking Archie if she could dust when she was finished helping upstairs.</p>

<p>With determination, Rebekah set to work, pulling out comic boxes and carefully dusting them off to prepare for restocking the shelves. The familiar scent of old comics and the prospect of revitalizing the basement energized her. While she was busy at work, the thought returned to her mind that maybe she could offer to help with the dusting once she was finished with the task at hand. It seemed like an excellent opportunity to contribute to the store and spend more time in this unique and exciting environment.</p>

<p>Rebekah carefully cradled the comics against her bare chest as she ascended the basement stairs. The task of holding the comics close added an interesting twist to her work, but she managed it with grace and a sense of purpose. Back on the main floor, she began arranging the comics on the shelves, ensuring each one found its proper place.</p>

<p>As she worked, Rebekah hoped she was being a good part of the store’s team, due to her dedication. Her thoughts went to her state of dress, and how that clearly also was helping, judging by the amount of customers in the store. Though she could see this number, her focus and concentration went to her work, and how she needed to organize the shelves.</p>

<p>Rebekah returned to the basement and diligently continued her work, blowing on the covers of the comics to remove the dust and bringing them up to restock the shelves. She repeated this process until they filled the shelves with fresh comics, waiting to be explored by eager customers.</p>

<p>Her dedication to ensuring the store was in top shape for the customers shone through. Rebekah’s willingness to go the extra mile and her unique approach to the job truly made her an indispensable part of the comic book store. She took pride in her contributions and looked forward to what other adventures and surprises lay ahead in her eventful day.</p>

<p>Rebekah soon made her way through the comic book aisles, her unique attire turning heads and raising eyebrows among the customers. Despite the initial surprise, she offered to help with a warm and friendly smile.</p>

<p>As she approached customers, she inquired, “Is there anything I can help you find today?” Her confident and helpful demeanor put many at ease, and they asked questions about different comics and graphic novels. Rebekah’s knowledge and passion for the medium shone through as she engaged in conversations, ensuring that everyone left the store with a satisfying experience. It had filled the day with surprises, and Rebekah was enjoying every moment, cherishing the connections she was making and the vibrant atmosphere of the comic book store.</p>

<p>Rebekah approached Archie with a warm smile, her enthusiasm apparent as she bounced with every step. She offered her assistance once again, asking, “Hey Archie since things seem to be slowing down a little, would it be okay if I go down to dust the basement?” Archie appreciated her dedication and nodded, saying, “Sure, Rebekah, that’s a great idea. The basement could use some tidying up. Go ahead and take care of it when you have the chance.”</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled at the opportunity given to her and headed back to the basement, ready to tackle the task of dusting.Rebekah’s determination shone as she began her dusting mission in the basement. The dust was more than she had anticipated, and she couldn’t help but exclaim, “Whoa, this is dust city!” to herself. But her enthusiasm remained undeterred rather, she smiled.</p>

<p>And with that same smile on her face, she moved to where Archie had provided the tools she needed for the task. Rebekah started near the area closest to the stairs, diligently working her way through the dust and grime. As she dusted and cleaned, the pleasure of seeing the space transform and become more inviting filled her with a sense of accomplishment.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>Rebekah’s commitment to her tasks, whether assisting customers or maintaining the store, was a testament to her dedication and the unique approach she brought to her job at the comic book store. She knew Archie could now see it firsthand, and that he could see the proof in the reviews only pleased her more. She continued working diligently, ready to make the basement shine despite the fact only staff would go down there.</p>

<p>Rebekah then looked over to where the comics were being stored while they were being transported to the store above. She understood how crucial it was to keep them spotless and aesthetically pleasing to customers. She then got to work, making sure that each comic was thoroughly cleaned and sparkled.</p>

<p>As she went through the rows of comics, she handled each one with care, dusting off the covers and ensuring they were in top-notch condition. Her meticulous approach to the task mirrored her commitment to making the store a welcoming and enjoyable place for comic enthusiasts. Rebekah continued her work, appreciating the opportunity to contribute to the store’s upkeep and the vibrant world of comics that had become a significant part of her life.</p>

<p>As Rebekah continued her work cleaning the comic book storage area, her thoughts drifted back to Andrea, bringing a warm smile to her lips. She cherished the fact that her work at the comic book store had brought them another chance to talk, and the chance for the invitation to reconnect.</p>

<p>Rebekah reminisced about the time they had spent together on Wednesday, hanging out in her apartment and later enjoying an arcade visit with Alexandra in tow. The memory of having the entire arcade to themselves had been a source of fun and laughter.</p>

<p>Her mind danced with thoughts of the unique and exciting experiences she had experienced recently, from her new truck to the intriguing encounters and connections she had made. Rebekah felt truly fortunate for the colorful journey her life had become, both in and out of the comic book store. Rebekah’s sense of accomplishment filled her with satisfaction as she looked at the neatly cleaned comic books in the basement. The comic book area was cleaned, and she knew it was time to tackle the rest of the basement.</p>

<p>As she contemplated her evening plans with Andrea, a thought occurred to her about their shared love for ham and pineapple pizza. The idea of enjoying a pizza together sounded great to her. She chuckled and said to herself, “I just remembered, Andrea loves ham and pineapple pizza, and since I know her mom won’t be home, we could eat it together. Huh, I’ve never eaten pizza naked before. Well, first time for everything!” Rebekah laughed, as she thought of the new experience she was about to undertake.</p>

<p>With the basement cleaned and her plans for the evening with Andrea set, Rebekah looked forward to the next chapter of her day, full of exciting possibilities.</p>

<p>Rebekah took the mop and diligently cleaned the hard concrete floor in the basement. After finishing the task, she allowed the floor to dry before heading up the stairs. As she entered the staff room, she glanced at herself in the mirror and couldn’t help but laugh at how dusty she appeared.</p>

<p>Her laughter was interrupted when Archie entered the room, his gasp followed by a burst of laughter. “You are very dusty! You might need to use the sink in the bathroom to clean up, though. Thanks for cleaning the basement!” Archie said, appreciating her initiative. Rebekah smiled and replied, “You’re welcome, Archie. I’m glad I could help. I guess I’ll take a break and freshen up in the bathroom, then.” She was grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the store and was ready to get rid of the dust that had accumulated during her basement cleaning.</p>

<p>Rebekah entered the bathroom and noticed the drain on the floor, which meant she could clean up with no concerns about creating a mess. She turned on the sink, adjusted the water to a warm temperature, and allowed it to run over her hands. With a sense of relaxation, she began washing the accumulated dust from her hands.</p>

<p>She splashed water on her face, refreshing her skin, and then turned her attention to her hair, working diligently to wash away any remaining dust. The water flowed down her back, following the curves of her body as it ran down her front.</p>

<p>After she was satisfied with the cleansing, Rebekah reached for a towel to dry her face, and then continued to dry the rest of her body. She felt refreshed and ready for the next part of her day, grateful for the convenience of the drain on the bathroom floor. Rebekah took a moment to check herself in the mirror before stepping out into the staff room and then into the main part of the store. She quietly surveyed the area, noting the customers browsing the shelves.</p>

<p>Rebekah chose the next customer she should check in on and made her approach towards a lady in the store. Rebekah spoke to her with a friendly smile, “Finding everything you need, ma’am?” Rebekah was ready to assist the woman, ensuring their visit to the store was as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p>The lady’s smile widened as she responded to Rebekah’s question. “Yes, dear, I have, thank you!” She expressed her contentment, and Rebekah’s state of undress didn’t seem to faze her in the least. Rebekah returned the smile and nodded, glad that the customer had found what she was looking for.</p>

<p>As Rebekah continued to assist customers, her interactions with the diverse clientele of the comic book store became a testament to the welcoming and unique atmosphere she helped create for them. Moments like these are what she looked forward to the most since they had surprises and potential connections.</p>

<p>Rebekah carried on with her work, remaining focused and attentive to the customers’ needs. She noticed some customers, both male and female, displaying appreciation for her presence, but she paid no visible attention to these glances as she continued her tasks.</p>

<p>While walking the aisles, Rebekah bent over to pick up a comic book that had fallen over. She glanced at the title and immediately knew its proper place. She once more showed her dedication to ensuring that everything was in order, and once more she was determined to maintain a welcoming and organized atmosphere for all customers.</p>

<p>Rebekah continued her rounds through the store, checking in on customers, and ensuring they were finding what they needed. “Rebekah, could you come back here a sec?’ Archie called, and when Rebekah returned to his side, he spoke again. “I need to use the toilet, so I’d like you to take over the cash register and make sure everyone paid for their purchases,” Archie told her, after finishing his explanation.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded and replied, “Sure, Archie.” With a confident and friendly demeanor, she moved behind the counter, ready to assist customers with their payments and uphold the smooth operation of the store in Archie’s absence. She approached her new role at the cash register with a welcoming smile. She carefully handled transactions, demonstrating her math skills with ease. Her experience as a member of the Helper’s Union had honed her ability to use math in various contexts, and she felt confident in her capacity to manage the register.</p>

<p>However, she noticed her nude state distracted some customers, causing her to repeat herself a few times. Nevertheless, she remained patient and focused, ensuring that every customer left the store with a positive experience, despite the unusual circumstances. She also bade farewell to the departing customers with a cheerful, “Have a good day!” She continued to watch as more customers entered the store, browsing through the comic book selection and making their purchases.</p>

<p>As she observed the flow of customers, Rebekah reflected on the importance of restocking to keep the store’s shelves full of stuff to sell and appealing to the customers. She contemplated returning to the basement for more comic books once Archie returned. The thought of contributing to the store’s vibrant inventory and the engaging atmosphere made her eager to continue her work, whether behind the cash register or in other areas of the store.</p>

<p>Rebekah felt a gentle, warm hand on her back, causing her to turn to see Archie’s return. “Thanks for looking after the place, Rebekah!” he said with a smile on his face, which also showed how glad he was at how responsible she was.</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled and replied, “No problem, I’m happy to help.” She stepped past the small door that separated the counter from the rest of the store, ready to continue her day, looking forward to any new tasks and adventures that awaited her at the comic book store.</p>

<p>Rebekah turned to Archie, her willingness to contribute clearly as she inquired, “Got anything new for me to do?” Archie appreciated her approach and thought for a moment. “Well, I think it’s about time we restocked some of the comics. How about heading back to the basement to see what we have down there? I’ll join you in a bit to help out.” Rebekah nodded with enthusiasm and made her way back to the basement, ready to embark on the next task to keep the comic book store running smoothly.</p>

<p>As she walked back to the basement, Rebekah nodded enthusiastically. Archie soon joined her as she made her way downstairs to the comic book area, helping her carry a sizable stack of fresh comics back to the shop.</p>

<p>The two of them worked together, restocking the shelves with the fresh comic books. As they worked, Rebekah inquired, “What are the most popular comic books you have?” Archie considered the question and replied, “Well, we’ve got quite a following for superhero titles like ‘The Defender’ and ‘Starburst Squadron.’ Those are some of our bestsellers. But we’ve also got a dedicated group of customers who are into more niche genres and indie comics. It’s a pretty diverse crowd.”</p>

<p>Rebekah found it fascinating to learn about the variety of comic book interests among the store’s customers as she continued the task of restocking the shelves. She was glad to contribute to keeping the store’s inventory up-to-date.</p>

<p>Rebekah shared her thoughts and contemplations with Archie as they worked on restocking the comic book shelves. “I’ve been thinking about becoming a comic book artist,” she began, “but I’m not sure if I want to give up being a Helper’s Union member. I get to meet interesting people, see unknown parts of our city I’ve never been to, like Skive Castle, the retirement home, Crystal Glacier Lake Center, and the Galley, the big grocery store past Yoda Street.”</p>

<p>Archie nodded thoughtfully and said, “It sounds like you’ve had some amazing experiences as a Helper’s Union member. Becoming a comic book artist is a different path, but it can be just as rewarding. You don’t necessarily have to quit your current job. Many artists have other jobs or hobbies on the side. It’s all about finding the right balance for you.”</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled as she appreciated Archie’s perspective and advice, and as she continued to consider her future options, both in the Helper’s Union and her aspirations as a comic book artist. She knew that whichever path she chose, it would be filled with unique experiences and opportunities.</p>

<p>Archie’s words had clearly impacted Rebekah, and she expressed her gratitude by saying, “Thanks, Archie,” a simple yet meaningful way of letting him know that his guidance and support were appreciated. As they continued their work in the comic book store, Rebekah pondered the exciting possibilities that lay ahead in her journey, both as a Helper’s Union member and a potential comic book artist.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s creativity sparked as she shared an idea with Archie. “The Amazing Titaness, a superhero with skin as tough as titanium!” She grinned and then looked at him. “Has there ever been a comic about a female superhero with hard skin like that?” she asked.</p>

<p>Archie considered the question for a moment before responding. “There have been many different superhero comics over the years, so there might be something similar out there. But your idea sounds new, and there’s always room for fresh takes on classic superhero concepts. If you’re interested in creating your own comic, it could be a fantastic project.”</p>

<p>Rebekah’s idea had piqued her curiosity, and Archie’s encouragement only fueled her imagination. It was a reminder that the world of comic books was vast and open to new, innovative characters and stories.</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded her excitement for the possibilities clear. “Yeah, I think after hanging out with my friend Andrea, I might look into it. I mean, both being an artist and exploring whether my idea is truly new,” she told Archie.</p>

<p>Archie smiled and said, “That sounds like a great plan, Rebekah. Don’t be afraid to chase your dreams and explore your creativity. You’ve got a lot of potential, and I’m sure you’ll find your own unique path.” Rebekah’s conversation with Archie reinforced her determination to follow her aspirations and explore the world of comic book artistry. She looked forward to the adventures and artistic journey that lay ahead, all while continuing her job.</p>

<p>Archie soon asked about Andrea, wanting to confirm something, “By the way, Andrea’s the one who came in earlier, right? The one who asked you to hang out at her place while being naked?” Rebekah nodded in response. “Yeah, that’s her. We met each other on Wednesday, she was really shy and had trouble making friends, so her mom became a client and used my job to make a new friend for her. She’s really nice and supportive, though.” she explained.</p>

<p>Archie’s curiosity about the recent visitor and the intriguing request had been satisfied, and Rebekah felt grateful for the friends she’d made this week who had embraced her for who she was and the diverse experiences they brought into her life.</p>

<p>Archie smiled as he listened to Rebekah’s explanation about Andrea. “She’s cute, and I couldn’t help but see her looking at you,” he said. His smile widened as he adopted a teasing tone. “Did my sister and Victor give you the birds and the bees talk?” he asked, evoking a giggle from Rebekah.</p>

<p>Rebekah’s reaction was a mix of surprise and laughter as she responded to his playful inquiry. “Archie!” The friendly banter added a lighthearted touch to their conversation, and Rebekah appreciated the camaraderie she had found at the comic book store.</p>

<p>Archie’s smile remained warm as he watched Rebekah laugh. He then extended a supportive offer, saying, “Still, if you ever need advice, you have three people to talk to on your side. We’ve been through it all, and then some, in my sister and Victor’s case. Plus, in many of these comic books, there are good examples too, though most aren’t normal, but who is?”</p>

<p>Rebekah appreciated the reassurance and guidance offered by her new friends and the world of comic books. She knew that she had a supportive network to turn to when seeking advice or navigating life’s challenges. The sense of camaraderie and the exchange of wisdom in the store added depth to her experiences.</p>

<p>Rebekah expressed her gratitude with a smile, acknowledging the unique perspectives she had access to. “Thanks, Archie. You’re right, of course. I do have three people I can talk to. Two men who understand the male mind and a woman who I’ve heard helped spearhead policies to make sure schools were safe for students,” she said.</p>

<p>The diverse backgrounds and experiences of her friends and mentors gave Rebekah a rich source of insights and support, which she valued greatly. As she leaned against the counter, it filled her with a sense of connection and belonging in her colorful and dynamic world.</p>

<p>Archie nodded with a warm smile on his face, appreciating Rebekah’s perspective. “Indeed, you’re right, of course. Me and Victor grew up as men, so we know,” he said.</p>

<p>He then informed Rebekah that it was time to close up shop, recognizing that she had plans and he needed to head home. He expressed his gratitude, saying, “Rebekah, thanks for coming to help me. I really appreciate it. You can come and work here anytime, and if you’d like, I can point you to some artists willing to teach you what you’d need to know to be a comic book artist.”</p>

<p>Rebekah smiled warmly and replied, “Thank you, Archie. I’ve had a great time here, and I appreciate the offer. I’ll definitely consider it.” As Archie moved toward the small doors, Rebekah prepared to wrap up her day and head to her date, her heart filled with gratitude for the connections and opportunities she had discovered at the comic book store.</p>

<p>Rebekah left the comic book store, enjoying the fresh air as she walked to her truck. After unlocking the door and settling inside, she started the engine and drove to Grand Pizza. There; she ordered a ham and pineapple pizza, a treat for her upcoming visit to Andrea’s place.</p>

<p>Now with a pizza in her custody, she drove her truck to Andrea’s and as she did; she wondered if Alexandra had been to this house when she dropped her off. She remembered the cute gnomes Alexandra described, being on Andrea’s family’s lawn. This would be a landmark she could use, though she knew that there had to be people who had them on their lawns, so she focused on the address she was given. She felt excited at the prospect of spending time with Andrea and savoring a delicious meal together.</p>

<p>She didn’t know if Andrea liked her as more than a friend, so she thought that she’d be careful here. Her thoughts turned soon to the day she’d had. The day had been full of interesting experiences, and she was happy to see it winding down to calmness. She was happy to hang out with Andrea, as this would provide her with a new experience too, something she hadn’t been able to get before.</p>

<p>“I think this is it,” Rebekah said to herself as she saw the address that Andrea had mentioned, and had her truck move to the curb, in front of Andrea’s house, and beside the driveway. Then she turned off the engine, and opened the door, before she moved to the other side of the truck, to grab the pizza. Pizza in arms, she moved towards the doors of her friend’s house, and carefully rang the doorbell.</p>

<p>Andrea opened the door with a warm smile, and her delight grew as she saw the pizza. “You remembered!” she exclaimed happily. She accepted both the pizza and her naked friend into the house, and they settled in to enjoy the pizza along with a fantasy movie. Which meant their time was spent laughing at the silly characters, delicious food, and the story of the movie they were watching.</p>

<p>When the movie was finished, the two talked about the week, with Rebekah being in the program, and the confirmation that indeed, Andrea was going to participate next week. So Rebekah took the time, then, to help her friend to get used to the program, and potential requests she’d had come up with. To the point that Andrea was soon sitting there naked as Andrea was. Rebekah focused on making Andrea comfortable while naked in her body, but she didn’t rush her or push too hard, just went at Andrea’s pace.</p>
