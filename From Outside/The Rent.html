<p>Part 1, The Proposal.
<p>The house looked wonderful.&nbsp; Set in a four-acre parcel of land
about two miles from the ocean, it glowed with the air of something loved
and well looked after.&nbsp; At three stories, it was a tall house, with
gabled roofs, huge windows, shutters, and even a small glass-enclosed fourth
floor on one end, almost like a tower in appearance.&nbsp; White, the house
looked clean and well maintained, and it went well with the landscaping
that complemented the isolation the owner wanted.
<p>It seemed a shame to Nina that such a home was hidden away from the
outside world.&nbsp; Around the property was a ten-foot-high brick wall
and plenty of trees obscured the view of the surrounding properties as
well.&nbsp; Not that anyone lived very close to each other anyway.&nbsp;
This area was exclusive, with one and two-acre lots butted up against each
other, all well landscaped to get the most of the space, yet providing
some seclusion for their owners.
<p>But the house Nina looked at was the only one to be completely hidden,
and had the largest lot of all.&nbsp; Even most of the grounds were invisible.
<p>Nina sighed as the cab came to a stop at the house end of the driveway.&nbsp;
She couldn't believe her luck, thinking how wonderful it would be to live
here.&nbsp; She had just moved halfway across the country, her new job
as a paralegal at a rather prestigious law firm necessitating her transfer
from the town she grew up in.&nbsp; Just getting the job had been a coup,
although in actual fact that had been the easy part, since her college
scholarship had been mostly paid by the firm in return for her spending
the next two years in their service.
<p>Her grandfather had been a founding partner, hence the unusual arrangement,
a part of his will that Nina had been glad to agree to.&nbsp; Her grandfather
had known of her desire to join the firm, despite her parents' protests,
and had made arrangements that lasted beyond his own death the year before.&nbsp;
Now Nina was set; two years as a paralegal, then on to law school.
<p>Nina would have preferred to go straight to law school, but her grandfather
told her that taking a couple of years between schools to work in the trenches
would teach her more than any school could do.&nbsp; It would give her
a leg up when she went back to school, and would always give her perspective
after she passed the bar exam and came back to the firm as one of the 'Team'.
<p>So Nina followed the plan, not that everything was laid out for her.&nbsp;
She STILL had to work her butt off making the grades, taking the courses.&nbsp;
Her grandfather had made the path of her life available to her, but she
still had to walk it on her own.
<p>But the hard work paid off; she graduated college with honors, and even
some of the Partners in the firm, who had at first regarded this bit of
nepotism with distrust, agreed that Nina had earned her place in the firm
and a chance for something big.
<p>Do well over the next two years and she would get an all expenses paid
trip to law school.
<p>There was one more incentive for Nina to succeed, though.&nbsp; Her
school loans were just that, loans.&nbsp; Her grandfather wanted her to
realize that you paid for everything in the end, but that if you worked
hard, the rewards would be great.&nbsp; So repayment on all her loans were
deferred until she became a lawyer and joined the firm, and her salary
then would ensure no problems repaying her debt.&nbsp; But if she failed,
then other arrangements would be made for their repayment.
<p>Nina did not plan to fail, and others watching her career thought the
same.&nbsp; One of those interested in her future was the owner of this
house.&nbsp; No longer a member of the firm, Brian Good was a contemporary
of her grandfather.&nbsp; He had retired as a full partner, retreating
to this secluded home where he could pursue his other interests uninterrupted.
<p>Nina had heard her grandfather speak of Brian many times, but had never
spoken to him herself.&nbsp; But when she found out that the apartment
she had reserved for herself had been rented out to someone else the week
before she got there, she had called the man out of desperation.&nbsp;
With little money of her own, she could not afford the few places left
to rent in this exclusive community, and her grandfather had always said
that his friend Brian was a man to be trusted.
<p>Brian of course knew of Nina's coming; he had helped make the arrangements
for Nina's education himself when he still worked at the firm, and even
retired, he liked to keep his hand in.
<p>He told Nina that he had a room he could let her stay in, and that he
would be glad for the company.&nbsp; Having a young woman about the place
again would be good for his blood pressure, he joked.&nbsp; But like her
grandfather, Brian believed that you shouldn't get anything for nothing.&nbsp;
So he made it clear to her that she would be paying a rent, but that it
would be something she could afford.
<p>Nina jumped at the chance, especially after she heard the address.&nbsp;
She wasn't a snob, but the idea of living in that area of town made her
head spin.
<p>Yes, things were looking good.
<p>Now that she was actually looking at the house, she felt even better.&nbsp;
It gave her a warm feeling to know that she was going to be sleeping here
that night, IF she could pay the rent.&nbsp; Nina chuckled; she doubted
she would have any problems with that.
<p>As the cab driver helped her haul her bags out of the back of the car,
the front door opened to reveal a rather dour looking woman in a sensible
dress and apron.&nbsp; Brian had told Nina that the only other occupant
of the house was his housekeeper, Mrs. Alison Terry.&nbsp; She had apparently
been with Brian for years, but she too had only recently moved into the
house, after her husband passed away the year before.
<p>"Miss West?" she said, passing a critical eye over the young woman.
<p>"Yes," replied Nina, looking up with a smile.&nbsp; "You must be Alison.&nbsp;
Mr. Cook said you were his housekeeper?"
<p>"That I am, but it's Mrs. Terry to you girl.&nbsp; We're not so friendly
that you can use my first name or I yours!"
<p>Nina was a little taken back, but figured that a little formality was
normal for this area.
<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Terry," Nina said.
<p>"That's quite alright, Miss West.&nbsp; I expect that's not the only
thing you will have to adjust to around here."
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "I expect not.&nbsp; Is Mr. Wood around?"
<p>"He's in his studio.&nbsp; He wanted to see you when you got here, but
you're early.&nbsp; He's very protective of that time though, and dislikes
to be disturbed for anything.&nbsp; You can meet him when he is done."
<p>"Studio?" asked the young woman.
<p>"Oh yes.&nbsp; Since he retired, Mr. Cook has had time to indulge himself
in his hobby.&nbsp; He's a sculptor, and a good one, I might add.&nbsp;
Now pay for your cab so we can let this man go, and I'll help you with
your bags."
<p>Nina nodded, and handed over a significant portion of her remaining
money to the overweight cab driver, who nodded his thanks and got back
in his vehicle.&nbsp; As he drove away, Nina watched him go before grabbing
two of the four suitcases she had brought.
<p>Mrs. Terry picked up the other two, displaying a hidden strength for
someone of her years, and led Nina into the house.
<p>The inside was just as spectacular as the outside.&nbsp; All in white
and with plenty of glass, the first floor looked open plan, with a huge
entrance hall leading to what looked like two different lounges on either
side.&nbsp; An open staircase led upstairs, and to the rear was what looked
like a formal dining room.&nbsp; Looking up, Nina could see that the entrance
hall went all the way up to the roof, the landings for each floor very
visible.
<p>It was all very airy, especially since the few solid walls the place
must have needed to hold itself up were covered in mirrors that reflected
the room over and over again.&nbsp; Large windows completed the affect,
letting in copious amounts of light, hardly separating the outside from
the inside at all.
<p>Mrs. Terry led Nina up the stairs to the second floor, where she paused.
<p>"That's Mr. Cook's suite," she said, pointing to the left at a closed
door.&nbsp; "You don't go in there unless invited."
<p>"Certainly not," agreed Nina.
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded and pointed the other way.&nbsp; "And over there is
his studio.&nbsp; When he is working, you can't go in, but otherwise I
doubt he would mind.&nbsp; Just don't touch anything, and don't poke your
nose into anything he has covered up!"
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Terry," replied the girl.
<p>The older woman led Nina up a second flight of stairs, lit by the light
of a huge window that dropped all the way to the first floor.&nbsp; Looking
down, Nina could see through the open treads the front door she had come
though.&nbsp; A thought struck her that anyone walking around the house
would be visible for quite a way around it, especially with all the mirrors
sending your reflection everywhere.&nbsp; Nina smiled, not knowing why.
<p>The third floor contained normal bedrooms.
<p>"I have a group of rooms on the east end.&nbsp; Again, I would thank
you not to go there unless I invite you.&nbsp; Mr. Cook was kind enough
to let me have that space, and he says it is mine to use as I will," said
the housekeeper, not even out of breath after hauling the two heavy suitcases
up here.
<p>"I would certainly not intrude on your privacy, Mrs. Terry," Nina replied,
breathing normally herself.&nbsp; Nina was an active swimmer and kept herself
in shape.&nbsp; One of the things that excited her about coming to live
in this community was that it was so close to the ocean.&nbsp; Even a couple
of miles away she could smell the sea air, and couldn't wait for her first
trip out there.
<p>"Your room," continued Mrs. Terry, "is down here, the west end."&nbsp;
She led Nina down a short hallway and opened the door.
<p>Nina took a breath.&nbsp; The bedroom was huge, almost the size of the
apartment she had lost in town.&nbsp; Again, the open motif of the house
was reflected in the enormous windows and the open plan.&nbsp; Looking
at the windows, Nina couldn't help wonder about her privacy, as there was
no part of the room not exposed to the outside.&nbsp; But all she could
see through them were trees and the property itself.&nbsp; No nosy neighbors
to spy on her, so she felt she could live with it.
<p>Mrs. Terry had put her bags down and had opened another door.&nbsp;
"Over here is your bathroom."
<p>Nina walked in to find a well-equipped room, which again was larger
than she thought a bathroom could be.&nbsp; It was a shock to see that
the outside wall was nothing but another ornate window, this time looking
over the back of the property, but again there was no one out there to
see IN.
<p>Looking out, she forgot her concerns as she spied the pool.&nbsp; It
wasn't big, but it was large enough for her to do some decent laps in.&nbsp;
Her fears at not getting any swim time in were averted.
<p>"I'll clean the bathroom for you," said the housekeeper, "and take care
of your room.&nbsp; But I would appreciate your picking up after yourself
and not making a pig sty of the place."
<p>"Oh, you don't have to do that, Mrs. Terry.&nbsp; I know how to clean,"
protested Nina.
<p>"I'm sure you do, Miss West, but it's my job and it all goes toward
earning my keep here.&nbsp; I'll leave you here to unpack, and you can
come find me in the kitchen when you are done.&nbsp; It's through the dining
room downstairs."
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Terry," said Nina happily.
<p>Mrs. Terry actually gave the young woman a smile before leaving her
alone in her new digs.
<p>Nina wandered around her bedroom, at one point falling on the king size
bed.&nbsp; She felt really good about it all and hoped that she wasn't
going to let these good people down.
<p>She wanted to succeed, to become someone her grandfather would be proud
of.&nbsp; Maybe, she thought, even her parents would be proud of her too.&nbsp;
Nina never understood why her parents hated her grandfather, but was glad
they didn't put up much of a fight when he insisted on getting to know
his baby granddaughter all those years ago.
<p>Her grandfather had been the only one to listen to her during her formative
years, lending a helpful ear when she had problems she couldn't talk to
her parents about.&nbsp; He must have spent thousands in long distance
calls over the years, and his twice-yearly visits were the high points
of her young life.&nbsp; His death had been hard on her, but Nina was a
strong, positive person who never let things get her down for long, and
she was sure that her grandfather, looking down on her now, was proud of
her getting this far.
<p>Eventually she got up and put her clothes away in the spacious closets.&nbsp;
Even though she had brought four bags full of stuff, her closets still
looked empty.&nbsp; The rest of her gear was in a storage locker in town,
and she knew she would be bringing more over, but as for clothes, this
was it.&nbsp; She hoped her salary from her new job would permit her to
buy some clothes better suited for the class of clientele the firm dealt
with, but that would all depend on the arrangement she would make with
Brian Cook.
<p>Nina changed her own clothes before she left to go find the kitchen.&nbsp;
She had been wearing some old sweats, comfortable for the long trip out
here, but she wanted to dress up for her first meeting with her landlord.&nbsp;
So she changed into a summer dress and sandals, and let down her ponytail.&nbsp;
A quick wash in the sun drenched bathroom, and then out the door she went.
<p>As she left her room, she saw something Mrs. Terry hadn't pointed out
to her, a spiral staircase leading up.&nbsp; Remembering the tower she
had seen from the outside, Nina wondered if this was the way into it.
<p>It was, and again Nina had her breath taken away.&nbsp; The room she
climbed up into was completely glassed in, walls and ceiling.&nbsp; Around
the room were scattered sun chairs and pillows, and one or two small tables.&nbsp;
This was a room designed for one thing, being out in the sun, and Nina
realized that winter or summer, you could come up here and work on your
tan.
<p>It was also fairly warm up here.&nbsp; Nina could already feel her dress
start to stick to her, so she went back down in search of Mrs. Terry.
<p>The kitchen, when she found it, did not let the house down.&nbsp; A
large central cooking island was surrounded by cupboards, appliances, and
countertops.&nbsp; Yet the place still looked very open due to the clever
use of windows and mirrors.&nbsp; It looked big enough to cook for a lot
more people than actually lived here, and Nina wondered if Brian Cook entertained
a lot.&nbsp; Certainly the twelve seat dining room set she had passed in
the dining room was a clue.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry was busy at one of the counters,
pouring lemonade from a pitcher into a couple of glasses on a tray.
<p>"There you are," she said.&nbsp; "Good timing, Miss West.&nbsp; Mr.
Cook has just come down and is waiting for you out on the patio."
<p>"That's great, I'm eager to meet him!"&nbsp; Nina replied.
<p>Mrs. Terry turned and looked over the girl once more.&nbsp; "That's
a nice dress, much better than that outfit you had on when you got here.&nbsp;
It's so nice to see girls your age paying attention to your appearance."
<p>"Thank you!" Nina said, not sure if Mrs. Terry was complimenting her
or not.
<p>The housekeeper just nodded and picked up the tray.&nbsp; "Well, come
along then," she said, and she led the young woman outside.
<p>The patio was large, with a brick barbecue at one end and the pool at
the other.&nbsp; Several sets of outdoor tables and chairs were scattered
around, and again Nina thought that her host entertained groups of people.&nbsp;
Her first sight of Brian Cook himself was of a gray haired man sitting
at a table close to the pool.&nbsp; He heard the clipping of Mrs. Terry's
shoes on the flagstones and turned.&nbsp; With a smile at Nina, he stood
up.
<p>Brian Cook was just a hair taller than Nina, and certainly around her
grandfather's age.&nbsp; He had a pleasant smile and bright eyes that he
brought to focus on the young woman.&nbsp; Barefoot, dressed in slacks
and a loose T-shirt, he seemed at odds with the opulence around him.&nbsp;
Nina never would have guessed that this man owned all she could see around
her.&nbsp; She wondered what he looked like when he used to work, all done
up nice in a suit.
<p>"Nina!" he said, when they drew close.&nbsp; He extended a hand.
<p>"Mr. Cook, it's nice to meet you after all this time," Nina said, taking
his hand.
<p>"Oh, call me Brian," said the old man.&nbsp; "I'm only ever Mr. Cook
at the office."&nbsp; He winked at Mrs. Terry, who was putting the tray
down on the table,
<p>"And to Alison of course.&nbsp; Isn't that right Alison!"
<p>Mrs. Terry turned, a half smile on her face.&nbsp; "Some things must
remain sacrosanct between employer and employee, Mr. Cook."
<p>"As you say, Alison."&nbsp; Brian gave her a smile, and the housekeeper
actually chuckled before walking away.
<p>"She's been with me for over twenty-five years," Brian said, motioning
to the table where both sat, "her husband helped me design and put in the
gardens around this house."
<p>"He did an incredible job," Nina said politely, meaning it.&nbsp; From
what she could see, the gardens were beautiful with flowers in bloom everywhere.
<p>"But you haven't even seen it yet.&nbsp; Come, I'll show you around
while we talk; you can bring your drink."
<p>Brian led Nina around the whole property, talking to her about her grandfather
and the business and asking after her own family.&nbsp; Of himself he didn't
say much, but Nina didn't mind. She found it a joy to be with him, and
could easily see how her grandfather considered Brian Cook to be his best
friend.
<p>At one point they reached a gazebo at the far end of the property, invisible
from the house and completely surrounded by the garden.&nbsp; Inside were
some chairs, and Brian settled down with a sigh.
<p>Nina continued to stand, and she walked slowly around the gazebo looking
at the masses of flowers that lit up the garden.&nbsp; She saw on display
a life-sized statue of a woman, apparently nude although that really wasn't
clear, one hand half covering her groin, the other to her throat.&nbsp;
The face of the figure was neutral, with no features beyond a general shape.&nbsp;
But the attitude of the figure suggested to Nina a moment of uncertainty,
as if the figure was undecided as to what to do next, where to place her
hands.&nbsp; It was very good.
<p>"Is that one of yours?" Nina asked.
<p>"Yes, I finished that one not too long ago."
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; Unlike the other more abstract works Brian had shown
her during their walk around the garden, this one was more representative,
and the best he had done in her opinion.
<p>"I like it," she said.&nbsp; She didn't notice Brian giving her a critical
looking over before he spoke again.
<p>"You know, Alex showed me pictures of you as you grew up," he began,
"and listening to him talk about you, I can't help feeling as proud as
he did at what an attractive woman you became."
<p>"Er...thank you!"&nbsp; Nina said, not quite knowing how to respond.&nbsp;
Nina had always found that hard.&nbsp; One side of her was always happy
for the compliment, for she did work hard to build and maintain a good
looking figure, although like most women she had her little insecurities.&nbsp;
She thought her bust too big, her hips too wide, and her ears stuck out
too much.&nbsp; Being a swimmer, she was jealous of those women with almost
no chest, which meant less drag to pull through the water.&nbsp; Yet at
the same time, she was trapped in the modern woman's thinking that a compliment
from a man only meant that he was looking at her for her body and not considering
that a real person lived there.
<p>It was a duality hard to come to terms with.&nbsp; But with Brian, it
seemed easier; after all, he wasn't some college guy who couldn't look
her in the eye for staring at her chest.&nbsp; Brian was...well, old enough
to be her grandfather.&nbsp; He grew up back when men could honestly compliment
women without fear of being sued for harassment!
<p>"Yes..." said Brian, focused on her once more.&nbsp; He shook his head
and put down his drink.&nbsp; "Come, we have to talk about your staying
here."
<p>Nina walked over and sat across from the old man.&nbsp; "I'm not sure
what my salary at the firm is going to be yet," she said.&nbsp; "I have
an idea, but I was supposed to make final arrangements there next week."
<p>"I know, but rather than tax your earnings, which won't be much at this
point I'm afraid, at least for this town.&nbsp; Rather than tax you financially,
I was hoping for trade of another kind."
<p>"What do you mean?" Nina asked, suddenly a little nervous.
<p>"No, no, no," Brian said with a smile.&nbsp; "I know your young mind,
Nina, and I can see you blushing."&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; "It's nothing
sexual, I promise you.&nbsp; I'm an old man, and while I can still appreciate
the sight of a pretty young woman like yourself, I'm too far gone to do
anything about it!"
<p>He grinned and Nina began to relax again.&nbsp; She wasn't sure why
she had thought what she did; he was right in what he guessed at.&nbsp;
She didn't feel that wave of lust she was accustomed to getting from men
who asked her out, so she felt safe.&nbsp; She smiled and laughed with
him.
<p>"That's okay, but you can't blame a girl for thinking that with a handsome
man like you sitting with her," Nina flirted.
<p>Brian laughed again.&nbsp; "You flatter me.&nbsp; No, what I need is
something more important to me right now.&nbsp; That piece," he pointed
at the statue outside, "was created through inspiration, and I'm very proud
of it.&nbsp; I'd like to do more of them, but it's hard to be that inspired
all the time.&nbsp; You never know when it may come."
<p>"Are you asking me to pose for you?" Nina asked, thinking she was quick
on the uptake.
<p>"In a matter of speaking, yes.&nbsp; But not in the way you think."
<p>Nina was a little taken back.&nbsp; The idea of posing for an artist
didn't bother her in general, she rather liked the idea, but the statue
seemed to be a nude, and that was another matter entirely.&nbsp; Yet, looking
around at where she was going to live, was that really a high price to
pay?&nbsp; All these thoughts buzzed through her head before she caught
Brian's last statement.
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"It's not a model I need, in the strictest sense.&nbsp; But an inspiration
of the moment."&nbsp; He looked at the statue again.&nbsp; "I caught her
in a moment of vulnerability, and that look stayed with me as I created...that.&nbsp;
It was inspiration of the moment, something I could never have created
in the studio.&nbsp; THAT's what I need.&nbsp; But it will entail some
sacrifice by you, if you agree."
<p>"What sacrifice?" Nina asked cautiously.
<p>"In return for your free room and board for the two years you work at
the firm before heading back to law school, all I require is that you give
up your right to clothing of any sort while on this property, so I can
observe you for my sculptures."
<p>"You must be joking!" Nina said, shocked.
<p>"No, I'm not.&nbsp; I'm quite serious.&nbsp; You need not worry; you
will not be touched, you will be perfectly safe, yet you will also spend
your time naked on the grounds and in the house, only to dress whenever
you have to leave."
<p>"How does that help your art?"
<p>"It helps because in this state you will have reactions to things and
feelings that you would not have being dressed.&nbsp; Being nude will add
some vulnerability to your state of mind, at least at first.&nbsp; Later,
once you adjust, if you do, that same nudity might bring you a joy you
never would have gotten otherwise, which again would be inspiration for
my work."
<p>"Couldn't I just pose for you a couple of times?"
<p>Brian frowned and leaned forward.&nbsp; "Look at what you are getting
in return; a wonderful home and no worries about your next meal or bills
or any of the other things that come with striking out on your own.&nbsp;
You will be able to concentrate on your new job with no distractions, no
worries."
<p>"Is my job in jeopardy if I say no?" Nina asked.
<p>Brian smiled, glad the girl was quick off the mark.&nbsp; "No, you earned
it, the job is yours.&nbsp; But saying no means you leave here as soon
as you have found other accommodation.&nbsp; And around here, that's spendy!&nbsp;
Can you afford to say no?"
<p>Nina looked at him wide eyed.
<p>Brian stood up.&nbsp; "Don't answer me now, take a few days.&nbsp; Get
to know the place and enjoy it.&nbsp; I can wait for your answer."&nbsp;
He smiled.&nbsp; "It's really good having you here, Nina.&nbsp; Don't worry,
it's just to look at you that I want, nothing else."
<p>Nina sat in silence as Brian left.
<p>What was she to do?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 1
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The Rent.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Part 2,&nbsp; The Decision.
<p>Nina spent the next couple of days deep in thought.&nbsp; On the surface,
the idea of living here naked seemed quite crazy, almost insulting!&nbsp;
She wasn't some cheap bimbo who didn't mind strutting around showing all
her charms to whomever was willing to pay; she was an intelligent woman
who planned to become a lawyer!&nbsp; Brian Cook's demands were almost
sexual harassment!
<p>Yet, Nina would always waffle, he didn't really demand anything, did
he?&nbsp; He told her, quite nicely, what he needed and why; and on the
face of it his argument was quite logical.&nbsp; And it wasn't as if he
was using his hobby as an excuse to see her naked; he was actually quite
skilled at what he did and Nina had no doubt that he was serious about
his reasons.
<p>And who else would see her?&nbsp; The housekeeper certainly, but that
was okay, wasn't it?&nbsp; Surely the woman must be used to seeing her
employer's models in various states of undress.
<p>Still, how comfortable would it be to never be dressed around the house
again?
<p>Nina thought about all this a lot, bouncing from one argument to another
throughout the course of the next few days.
<p>But she was being seduced, not by Brian Cook per se, but by the house.&nbsp;
It was just beautiful, and her first night there had been like living in
heaven.&nbsp; She had all the creature comforts she could have wanted,
many that she thought she never could have afforded on her own.&nbsp; It
was hard to think that she might have to give it all up if she decided
to turn down her host's offer.
<p>Brian Cook did sweeten the pot even further, though.&nbsp; On her second
day at the house, he took her down the driveway to the large garage next
to the gate in the wall where cars had access to the property.&nbsp; The
gate stayed closed all the time--it was opened electronically from the
garage or the house--and was just another symbol of the privacy Brian wanted.
<p>Standing next to it, Nina tried to find out just how much could be seen
from the gate.&nbsp; If she was going to be walking around out here naked,
she wanted to make sure she wasn't giving the neighborhood a show.&nbsp;
But the driveway curved sharply just beyond the garage and the landscaping
took care of the rest.&nbsp; She realized that she would be perfectly safe.
<p>But that wasn't why she and Brian had come down.&nbsp; He led her through
a back door, and inside Nina found several cars in the spotless parking
bay.
<p>One looked like a classic from the twenties, and Brian told her it was
an early Ford.
<p>A more modern Jaguar sat next to it, as did a rather beaten up Ford
pickup and a large sedan.&nbsp; At the end of the row was a Geo with a
convertible top.&nbsp; Nina thought it looked cute.
<p>"The sedan is Alison's," Brian said to her, "but I thought you might
be interested in the Geo.&nbsp; It's my granddaughter's, for when she comes
to visit, but I was thinking of letting you use it as well.&nbsp; You will
need some way of getting to and from work, wouldn't you?"&nbsp; He smiled
at her and Nina's face lit up.
<p>"I'd LOVE to use it, thank you!" Nina said, thinking to herself how
cute she'd look driving around in it.
<p>"Of course, if you weren't living here that wouldn't work.&nbsp; I'd
need the car here if Kelly suddenly showed up.&nbsp; It wouldn't do to
have it elsewhere."
<p>Nina's face fell at the thought of not using the car, and was smart
enough to know that Brian was using it to influence her decision.&nbsp;
Yet even knowing that didn't make it any easier.
<p>The twosome left the building and walked back to the house.
<p>Despite the unresolved issue between them, Nina and Brian got on quite
well.&nbsp; He was a generous and happy host, always willing to talk and
spend time with this girl he treated almost like another granddaughter.&nbsp;
As time went by, he opened up about himself some more and Nina found out
about his own family.&nbsp; He had a daughter, married, who was a doctor
in a major city hospital halfway across the country.&nbsp; And there were
two grandchildren, twins, a boy and a girl, both at university.&nbsp; They
were two years younger than Nina, and while Kelly frequently dropped in
to see her grandfather, Christopher would rarely visit.
<p>Nina got the impression that a coincidence of birth was all the twins
shared, and that they were not alike in most ways.
<p>But spending time with Brian was fun; he showed her his studio and all
his unfinished pieces, hinting again at how just a little inspiration would
help him complete many of them.&nbsp; He even sat her down and did a few
sketches of her.
<p>But as the days wore on, Nina figured that of all the things that helped
her make her decision, it was the pool that tipped the scales.&nbsp; It
was just so darn handy!
<p>Each morning before she ate, she would change into her swim suit and
pad down to the pool for her exercise.&nbsp; She had quickly gotten used
to changing clothes in front of the huge floor to ceiling windows of her
room, but couldn't help thinking each time she did so how it would feel
to always be nude behind them.
<p>Still, she DID enjoy the swimming, pulling laps until she felt that
comfortable ache in her shoulders and legs that signaled a good work out.&nbsp;
She would then towel off and come inside, where Mrs. Terry would have breakfast
ready for her.
<p>Her first morning there, Nina dressed first before eating, but after
that she didn't bother, sitting at the breakfast counter in the kitchen
in just her suit.
<p>Mrs. Terry didn't seem to mind at all, which eased Nina's anxiety a
little.&nbsp; If the housekeeper was someone whose nose would have been
put out of joint by what Nina wore or didn't wear, then it would have been
a lot harder for Nina to consider saying yes.
<p>On Nina's fourth night, the young woman couldn't sleep.&nbsp; She tossed
and turned in her bed for hours, wrestling with her decision.
<p>What was it going to be like?
<p>Then she realized that the only way to find out was to give it a try,
so she got out of bed.
<p>Her room wasn't dark; moonlight lit up her room a little, the sky looking
clear and bright through the huge windows of her room.&nbsp; Nina stood
quietly for a moment in the football jersey she used as a nightgown, before
biting her lip and lifting it off her.
<p>She dropped it on the floor and just stood.&nbsp; Of course she had
been naked in this room before, but that was just while changing from one
thing to the other.&nbsp; She had never undressed here just to BE undressed.
<p>She curled her toes, then padded silently to the window.&nbsp; She looked
out, watching carefully for any sign of someone in the dark being able
to see her.&nbsp; But while she was aware there were houses out there beyond
the wall around the property, she could not see any lights from any of
them.
<p>Nina leaned against the window, taking in a sharp breath as her breasts
pressed against the cool glass.&nbsp; It was such an unusual feeling, completely
new to her.&nbsp; She had never had glass up against her breasts before,
certainly not like this.&nbsp; Nina almost giggled.
<p>With a smile, she backed off and padded into the bathroom.&nbsp; She
went straight to the window and did it again, pushing her breasts against
the glass while she checked out the back of the house.&nbsp; All was quiet,
everyone else asleep.
<p>A mad idea entered her head, and Nina was shocked at herself.&nbsp;
But the idea wouldn't leave, and the longer it stayed the more tempting
it was.&nbsp; Her heart beating a little faster, Nina grabbed a towel and
left the bathroom.&nbsp; She went to the door of her room and swallowed.&nbsp;
Gathering her courage, she opened the door and peeked out.
<p>All was quiet.&nbsp; At the far end of the hall were the housekeeper's
rooms.&nbsp; At any moment Nina expected Mrs. Terry to come bursting out,
but of course nothing happened.&nbsp; The woman was asleep, Nina told herself.
<p>Gingerly, Nina crept out into the hallway.&nbsp; She passed the iron
spiral staircase that led up to the sunroom and debated on going up there,
but continued on.&nbsp; She made it to the stairs and paused, looking down.
<p>The house was still, but movement caught her eye.&nbsp; She looked up
in panic and saw it was just the trees outside moving in the wind.&nbsp;
With so many windows, it seemed like the outdoors were inside with her.
<p>Nina took a breath and began walking down the staircase.&nbsp; She skipped
quickly and silently past the second floor where Brian slept, and made
it to the ground floor with ease.&nbsp; She looked up now, thinking about
how her clothes were now out of reach.&nbsp; She wondered why she was doing
this.&nbsp; Would the idea of walking around out here naked have come to
her if Brian Cook hadn't had made that suggestion to her?
<p>Nina didn't know, but there she was all the same.&nbsp; She moved quickly
onward through the dining room to a set of French doors that opened onto
the patio.&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, she opened the doors and stepped
outside.
<p>It seemed very strange to her, standing in the dark outside with nothing
on.&nbsp; The wind was a little restless, pockets of air moving in all
directions, flowing about her body in ways she had never felt before.&nbsp;
She stepped away from the doors, holding her arms out to let the wind brush
her skin.&nbsp; It felt good, great even, yet it also felt quite scary,
as it only emphasized the fact that she had no clothes on.
<p>Nina continued to walk away from the house, her eyes continually looking
around to see if anyone could see her.&nbsp; She saw no one.
<p>Relaxing a little, she draped her towel over the back of a chair, and
padded to the pool.&nbsp; There were pool lights, she had been told, but
they were off right now.&nbsp; Had they been on, Nina no doubt would not
have wanted to try this.&nbsp; But the closer she drew to the pool, the
more she felt the urge for a swim, a naked swim!
<p>Poolside, she eased herself into the water, marveling at its perfect
temperature, and with a practiced ease, she pushed away and began to swim.
<p>Nina was surprised; there was a marked difference from her morning crawls.&nbsp;
She had always thought her swimsuit comfortable, hardly noticing it when
it was on and barely conscious of the way it pulled against her as she
moved through the water.&nbsp; But swimming without it now made her feel
quite different.&nbsp; She went through a full range of motions, expecting
the sudden binding around her thighs or across her shoulders that she was
used to, but it never came.
<p>Joyfully Nina dove and swam around, enjoying the freedom of movement
her lack of a suit gave her.&nbsp; She even started working out in earnest,
pulling hard into doing a couple of serious laps to see how it felt.&nbsp;
She only stopped when she realized the pool lights had come on.
<p>Startled, she looked up, attempting to tread water while at the same
time trying to cover up.&nbsp; It was a reflex action, but not a very good
one.&nbsp; It took only a couple of seconds for her to see by the light
from the pool that she was no longer alone.
<p>Dressed in a robe, Brian Cook stood next to the pool looking down at
her with a slight smile.&nbsp; He shook his head and chuckled while Nina
moved quickly to the side of the pool.&nbsp; She was very aware that the
pool lights afforded her no protection from his gaze whatsoever, and she
was very embarrassed.&nbsp; She had no doubts that he had seen everything
she had.
<p>"I'm sorry, Nina," Brian said, "I didn't know it was you.&nbsp; I guess
I should have told you about the alarm system, but then I didn't expect
you to be out here in the middle of the night."
<p>"Alarm system?" Nina said, taking shelter at the edge of the pool.&nbsp;
She wished she had her towel.
<p>"Yes, all the doors and windows are wired.&nbsp; The alarm is in my
room and it woke me up.&nbsp; I was about to call the police when I heard
you splashing around out here.&nbsp; I would have told you the codes, but
I was waiting on your decision first."&nbsp; He smiled down at her.&nbsp;
"Is this an indication that you might be staying after all?"
<p>"Er..." Nina said.&nbsp; "I...er...just wanted to see what it was like
to...well..."
<p>"It's okay, Nina.&nbsp; You don't have to explain."
<p>Nina looked away from him, embarrassed yet confused as well.
<p>HAD she made her decision?
<p>Brian walked back and got her towel.&nbsp; He brought it to her and
turned away while Nina climbed out of the pool.&nbsp; Nina nervously wrapped
the towel around herself and stood silently, waiting.
<p>"You know, Nina, what I said was true, about needing a certain inspiration
for my work," Brian said, not looking at her.&nbsp; "Look at you now; the
way you are standing, the things you are feeling.&nbsp; You're embarrassed,
right; a little ashamed at being caught? Yet you're also fighting the feeling
that you enjoyed your swim.&nbsp; I saw you smiling as I turned the lights
on; it felt good, didn't it?&nbsp; No doubt, if you decide to stay you
will feel embarrassed a lot of the time; but you will also feel as good
as you felt swimming here tonight, maybe even better as you discover the
freedoms I'm granting you.
<p>"Don't ignore how you're feeling right now, don't be ashamed of it or
put it away somewhere.&nbsp; Make these feelings a part of your decision
process."
<p>There was a pause, then the old man began to walk toward the house.
<p>Nina took a deep breath, a thousand thoughts and feelings echoing through
her; yet she couldn't deny the pleasure she had gotten in the water, and
the thought of more of that to come was enticing indeed.
<p>Nina made her decision, and dropped her towel.
<p>"Brian!" she called out to her host.
<p>Brian Cook stopped.&nbsp; Slowly he turned to look at her, and Nina
held fast.&nbsp; Not since her last boyfriend had she purposely allowed
someone to see her naked; and even he didn't get a really good look.
<p>Brian stood quietly, taking her in, noticing more the courage she showed
than the way her youthful body actually looked.&nbsp; Younger men would
have let their eyes concentrate on her round breasts and the diamond-like
gap at the top of her well-muscled thighs, but Brian took her in as a whole.&nbsp;
He had been telling the truth, he really needed her for the reasons he
told her; and it was with an artist's eye that he examined her.
<p>"Thank you," he said,&nbsp; "you have no idea how much you have helped
this old man out."
<p>"That's...okay.&nbsp; I want to help," Nina said for want of something
to say.&nbsp; She was nervous and still embarrassed, but it wasn't as bad
as she thought it would be.
<p>"We'll go over the details tomorrow," Brian told her.&nbsp; "If you
don't dress in the morning, then we can assume that you have made your
final decision.&nbsp; At least you will get another chance to sleep on
it."&nbsp; He smiled.
<p>"Okay," said Nina.
<p>"Goodnight, Nina," Brian said, turning away and walking back into the
house.
<p>Nina realized she was shivering, and picked up the towel again.&nbsp;
She dried herself off and began to wrap herself up in it, then stopped.&nbsp;
Now that she had decided to go through with it, decided to spend the next
two years of her life naked in this house and inside the walls surround
the garden, she felt odd hiding behind a towel.&nbsp; A part of her screamed
out to be wrapped up, to be covered.&nbsp; But Nina held fast and put the
towel down on a table.
<p>Naked, with nothing in her hands, she walked as calmly as she could
back inside and up to bed.
<p>She fell asleep immediately.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Part 3,&nbsp; The Contract
<p>Nina awoke refreshed, noting from the angle of the rays of sunlight
entering her room that she had slept in a little.&nbsp; Climbing out of
bed, she was startled by the feeling of the satin sheets against her bare
skin, and remembered the events of the night before.
<p>She sat for a moment, her eyes on some birds outside her window, her
mind on the decision she had made.&nbsp; In the light of day, it looked
quite different, yet Nina still felt relaxed, less tense.
<p>She stood up and went the bathroom, going through her morning routine
as she did each morning, only this time doing it nude.&nbsp; When she approached
her closet, she paused.
<p>Now was the time she usually chose what she was going to wear for the
day, and she knew that inside her closet all her clothes were nicely laid
out or hung up ready for her.&nbsp; But she had made a promise not to wear
them again as long as she was home, hadn't she?&nbsp; It was going to be
how she paid the rent for the fabulous room she slept in and the wonderful
house and grounds she lived in, to always be naked here.
<p>Nina took a deep breath and turned to the door of her room.
<p>On this side of the door, she was safe.&nbsp; She could be naked if
she wanted to, with nothing else implied.&nbsp; She had, after all, been
given one more chance to think over her decision.&nbsp; But if she was
to step outside the room, naked as she was now, then that was it.&nbsp;
But not to do so meant either spending real money that she couldn't afford
for a place to live in this expensive town, or go home in disgrace unable
to fulfill her Grandfather's plan for her future, a future she wanted very
badly.
<p>What was being asked of her really, anyway?&nbsp; Just that she go about
her regular activities while allowing her host and probably his housekeeper
to see her au naturel!&nbsp; There were plenty of people who would have
no problem doing this at all; why should she be any different?
<p>Nina stood facing her bedroom door for several minutes, considering
all of this, before finally reaching for the handle and taking the plunge.
<p>The hallway outside her bedroom was well lit by sunlight, and Nina was
once again reminded about how much of this house was open to the outside
via the large number of oversized windows it had.&nbsp; As Nina slowly
padded down the hallway, she wondered if there was a single place in the
whole building not visible from the outdoors, or she thought, looking at
her reflection, not visible in one of the many mirrors that coated whatever
wasn't glass.
<p>Certainly, no one IN the house could miss her, and with all the mirrors,
they would have an easy time seeing every side of her with no effort at
all!
<p>Nina made an effort not to cover up, and started down the stairs.
<p>She remembered her skinny dip the night before, how different the house
looked then.&nbsp; It certainly wasn't the same now, walking down the stairs
in broad daylight.
<p>Nervously she looked about, wondering if anyone was around, but saw
no one.&nbsp; She made it to the first floor and padded on her bare feet
to the kitchen.
<p>Here there were signs of life, for as usual Mrs. Terry was busy making
breakfast.
<p>Nina hesitated before stepping into the kitchen, acutely aware of her
nakedness versus the housekeeper's full dress and apron.&nbsp; But it turned
out her covert action had been wasted.
<p>"Ah, Miss West!" said Mrs. Terry, catching a glimpse of the nervous
girl in a mirror.&nbsp; "Good morning!"
<p>Nina jumped, then smiled a little.&nbsp; She screwed in her courage
and stepped into the room, expecting to see the housekeeper's eyes narrow
in disgust.&nbsp; "Good morning, Mrs. Terry," she said.
<p>The older woman turned from the sink where she was washing a pan, and
while drying her hands, took a good long look at Nina.
<p>Nina was stunned, but didn't move.&nbsp; To be honest, she didn't know
what to do!&nbsp; A part of her wanted to run screaming upstairs for something
to cover herself up with.
<p>"I see that you have decided to accept Mr. Cook's offer, then!" said
Mrs. Terry, not giving any hint of her opinions on the naked girl in front
of her.
<p>"You...you know about that?" Nina asked.
<p>"Well, girl.&nbsp; He can hardly have you walking around here in the
all together without consulting with me first!&nbsp; It may be his home,
but I live and work here too!"
<p>Nina supposed that was true.&nbsp; Her host was a lawyer, although a
retired one, and the fledgling lawyer in Nina considered that such things
as the threat of sexual harassment had to be considered.&nbsp; He couldn't
afford to offend his housekeeper, which meant that she evidently gave her
approval for this adventure Nina was going through.
<p>Oddly, that made Nina feel a little better, but then she wondered just
how legal this form of "rent" was, anyway.
<p>Mrs. Terry turned back to her sink.&nbsp; "Breakfast is at the usual
time," she said.&nbsp; "You'll have time for your swim!"
<p>"My swim?&nbsp; Oh...yes," replied the young woman.&nbsp; "But Mrs.
Terry, do you know where Bri...where Mr. Cook is right now?"
<p>"He said to come up to his studio after you've eaten."
<p>"Oh...okay."&nbsp; Feeling self conscious, Nina crossed the kitchen
and stepped through the doors to the outside.&nbsp; Again she paused, standing
in the sunshine.
<p>She had been out here naked just last night, but that was in the dark,
not out in the bright light of day.&nbsp; Nervously she scanned her surroundings,
but saw no one.&nbsp; Intellectually she knew that no one could have seen
her, the house and grounds were very private after all, but the novelty
of the situation still made her cautious.&nbsp; But after a minute Nina
shrugged and walked out onto the patio.&nbsp; She berated herself for her
jumpiness.&nbsp; She knew she couldn't keep acting the way she had, or
the stress would murder her.&nbsp; The only way she was going to get through
it all was to just DO IT!
<p>So she went through her stretching and warm up exercises, and slipped
into the water.
<p>As she began her workout, she failed to notice the man in the window
looking down on her from the second floor.&nbsp; Brian Cook nodded to himself,
acknowledging how well his plan was going.&nbsp; She was just the subject
he needed for his art; timid, self conscious, and strikingly beautiful
in that girl next door way.&nbsp; Already in his mind's eye he had a couple
of pieces of sculpture planned; he looked forward to many more.&nbsp; But
there was just one more step to go.
<p>Down in the pool, Nina enjoyed her swim.&nbsp; Just like the night before,
she could tell the difference between swimming nude and swimming in her
swimsuit.&nbsp; She felt unrestricted, powerful, able to push her workout
to limits seemingly unreachable before.&nbsp; She could feel the slipstream
of her passage through the water over every inch of her body, and she knew
that she was not getting the drag that she used to get from her suit.&nbsp;
As she pounded down those last few laps, she thought about how much better
she could have swum at college and high school had she not been required
to wear a suit.&nbsp; But then with a smile that almost made her break
her rhythm, she figured she wouldn't have had the courage to swim naked
in front of all those people, but then it might have been interesting if
the entire swim team had to be nude as well...including the men!
<p>She touched the side at the end of the final lap with a giggle, her
mind filled with the image of one or two of the male swimmers she had known,
sans trunks!
<p>Getting out, she realized that she had neglected to bring a towel down,
and that dimmed her mood a little.&nbsp; But the morning sun was already
strong, so she just did her cool down stretches wet, her skin air-drying
naturally.
<p>Two more thoughts passed through her head before she went in to breakfast.&nbsp;
She first thought that some of the positions she assumed while she stretched
were very revealing indeed, and as she padded to the house, she also figured
she would have to get more sun tan lotion if she was going to expose everything
to the sun from now on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The elderly Brian Cook was sitting at a table doing some sketches based
on what he had seen out the window, when he heard the knock on the door.&nbsp;
He looked up and smiled before bidding entrance.
<p>The door opened slowly and Nina's head poked around the side, one bare
shoulder also visible.&nbsp; "Hi...Brian.&nbsp; You wanted to see me?"
Nina asked, mentally kicking herself for her choice in words.
<p>Brian caught the double meaning as well, and chuckled.&nbsp; "Yes, do
come in will you."
<p>Nina stepped through the door and closed it behind her, her face composed
although her body language showed her ill at ease.&nbsp; It was exactly
what Brian had been looking for, and he studied her for a moment.&nbsp;
She was quite lovely, he thought, and he knew he wasn't TOO old to appreciate
the sight of a beautiful naked woman.&nbsp; But this WAS for art, so he
told himself.&nbsp; He wondered if he should keep the girl standing there
for him to observe, but didn't want to push her too much.&nbsp; Brian was
actually quite fond of his best friend's granddaughter, and didn't want
to cause her any distress, at least not yet.
<p>"Come, sit over here!" he said with a smile.
<p>Nina smiled back and quickly padded over while Brian admired the slight
bounce her steps gave her breasts.&nbsp; No, he wasn't too old at all!&nbsp;
He watched Nina's graceful slide into the chair on the other side of the
table, and thought she was probably glad to be at least half covered up.
<p>"How was your swim?" he asked, making her jump.
<p>"Oh...it was fine...thank you!"
<p>"I'm glad you're getting a proper use out of that pool.&nbsp; Only my
granddaughter has ever used it before."
<p>"You mean Kelly?&nbsp; I think you mentioned her yesterday," said Nina.
<p>Brian nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, but we can talk about that later.&nbsp; What
I wanted to see you about now was this."&nbsp; Brian Cook pulled an envelope
out from a drawer on his side and opened it.&nbsp; Inside were several
sheets of paper, all identical from what Nina could see.&nbsp; "Forgive
this old lawyer," Brian said, "But as you might be aware, there are legal
issues here we have to deal with; after all, our arrangement could have
potential consequences that neither of us want.&nbsp; So I took the liberty
of drawing up your lease."
<p>"My lease?"
<p>"Yes, of course there will be a lease; a contract defining what I am
asking and what you will provide in return for your lodging here.&nbsp;
One thing you have to learn, young lady, if you expect to succeed in the
legal world, is that nothing can be accomplished without the proper written
agreements first.&nbsp; So, here you are."&nbsp; Brian handed her one copy
of his lease and Nina began to dutifully read it.
<p>It was not as long as it could have been, considering who had drafted
it, so Nina was able to start frowning almost right away.
<p>"What's this?" she asked, looking up at her host who sat watching her
calmly.&nbsp; "You're taking away my clothes?"
<p>"They are merely going into storage, where you can get them whenever
you leave the property," Brian replied.
<p>Nina looked at the contract again.&nbsp; "The garage?"
<p>"Yes.&nbsp; There is a small apartment there and your clothes will be
locked inside."
<p>"But why locked?"
<p>"So as to avoid temptation on your part.&nbsp; I know there will be
times when you will want to run and get dressed; I feel you have the urge
already, don't you?"
<p>Nina nodded guiltily, her face flushing a little.
<p>"Well if they are locked away from you, then it will help you resist
that urge.&nbsp; But you need only tell me when you need to leave the property,
and I will come down to the garage with you and give you access.&nbsp;
Of course when you return, you will stop there to undress again.&nbsp;
But it's all there in the lease."
<p>It was, complete instructions as to exactly when she would be allowed
clothing and how to get it.&nbsp; The contract was short on 'whys' but
detailed in everything else.&nbsp; From what Nina could see, it was certainly
true that she would not be getting any farther than the garage with anything
on.
<p>One other section also made her frown.
<p>"It says here that you will determine who sees me like this and who
doesn't!&nbsp; I thought it was just you and Mrs. Terry!"
<p>"My dear, I do entertain quite a bit, and you don't expect me to stop
doing that over the next couple of years just to preserve your modesty!"
<p>"But I can't be seen by strangers!" Nina said, horrified.
<p>"Nonsense.&nbsp; For my work to be effective, I need you to retain that
self-consciousness you display so readily right now.&nbsp; In time, I know
that you will grow accustomed to appearing as you are in front of us, so
your exposure to others will be a reminder of your condition."
<p>"But you can't!"
<p>"Now, now.&nbsp; You act as if I'm going to expose you to the whole
world.&nbsp; I promise that your integrity will be cared for.&nbsp; It
will not affect your reputation or your image.&nbsp; The people that would
see you are perfectly accepting towards nudity and art; in fact, for the
most part they are fellow artists like myself that would no doubt find
inspiration in you as I have done.&nbsp; To them you are NOT Nina West,
paralegal, but simply a young, fit, female body with interesting highlights
and curves.
<p>"You need not worry."
<p>"I'm still not sure."
<p>Brian reached out.&nbsp; "Trust me.&nbsp; You will be able to hide in
your room when I have people over that wouldn't understand what we are
doing here!"
<p>Nina swallowed, but the honest look on Brian's face convinced her that
he was sincere.&nbsp; "Okay," she said presently.
<p>Brian smiled and Nina finished reading.&nbsp; The rest of the lease
detailed what would happen if she violated any of the agreements.&nbsp;
Basically, it said that in breaking the lease she would be liable for the
monetary amount due at that time had she been paying in legal tender for
her room and board.
<p>Nina's eyes opened wide when she saw the monthly totals.&nbsp; But it
also said that successful completion of the lease would entail Brian Cook
paying her the full amount she would otherwise have paid him.&nbsp; She
looked up at that.
<p>Brian smiled.&nbsp; "Call it, an investment in your future," he said.&nbsp;
"I know that Law School can be tough, especially if you have to work to
pay your way through.&nbsp; The firm is of course picking up your tuition,
but as for living expenses, you were on your own.&nbsp; But now you needn't
worry."
<p>"Thank you!" Nina said startled.
<p>"So, are we in agreement?" Brian asked.
<p>Nina looked down.&nbsp; She had two choices.&nbsp; Not sign the lease
and go get dressed, which meant leaving this house, this town, her new
job, and most likely her career, as she couldn't afford to stay here.&nbsp;
Or sign the lease and live here naked for two years, with a big fat check
at the end of it to help her pay her way through Law School.&nbsp; Yet
the second choice would expose her to not just her host and his housekeeper,
but anyone he chose, and she would not have access to any of her clothes.
<p>Brian carefully laid a pen down on the table.
<p>Nina looked at the pen, then with a sigh she reached out and took it.&nbsp;
It took just a minute to sign all the copies and she was committed, and
as she did so, Brian stood up and went to an intercom on the wall nearby.&nbsp;
"Mrs. Terry," he said quietly as he watched the girl work through the paperwork,
"she has just signed the contract, you can begin right away."
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Part 4,&nbsp; It Begins.
<p>Nina West had just signed away her right to wear clothes in her new
home.&nbsp; She could be exposed to anyone her host thought entitled, and
she was also to be forcibly kept away from her clothing.&nbsp; The realization
of what she had done was only just beginning to sink in when her host,
Brian Cook, decided to get things moving.
<p>"Well done, young Nina!" he said with a smile, taking the papers she
had signed from her.&nbsp; He separated a few sheets and handed a few back
to her.
<p>"These are your copies, you can keep them in your room."
<p>"Er...thanks," said the young woman, quite conscious of the bare wooden
seat under her naked butt.
<p>"Now on to business.&nbsp; I just called Alison to let her know you
signed, she'll meet us in your room."
<p>"My room?" asked Nina, wondering why the housekeeper would be going
there.
<p>"Of course!&nbsp; We have to remove your clothes from the house right
away; we can't have you in violation of your lease now, can we!"
<p>A small shudder passed through Nina, but she smiled anyway and stood.&nbsp;
Her nudity felt even more pronounced to her now, as if signing those papers
had stripped away her final layer of protection.&nbsp; She was now committed
to two years of exposure.&nbsp; At least, she thought, it would only be
in the house and on its grounds.
<p>Her elderly host gathered a few things and accompanied the young woman
to the door, chatting about how much work he could get done now and how
helpful she was.&nbsp; Nina just nodded in the right places and walked
with her arms across her chest.&nbsp; She kept her eyes down, avoiding
her own reflection in the hundreds of mirrors that scattered her image
around the house, and the outside world that seemed so close through the
huge windows the house seemed made of.
<p>"I can do this," she said to herself, her host not hearing her.&nbsp;
They went upstairs to Nina's room and found the housekeeper, Alison Terry,
already working on Nina's closet.&nbsp; The housekeeper looked over her
shoulder at the naked woman, again not showing any reaction to her nudity.&nbsp;
It was as if she saw this kind of thing all the time.
<p>"I'm just packing your clothes, Miss West," said the very formal Mrs.
Terry.&nbsp; "Even your shoes.&nbsp; Everything else can stay."
<p>"I'll give you a hand," Nina said, nodding slowly.
<p>Brian Cook watched the two women quickly pack up Nina's things, and
couldn't help noticing the difference in their demeanor.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry
moved normally, reaching up for things or bending low without a thought
to how she looked.&nbsp; Nina on the other hand seemed determined to do
things one handed, the other arm across her breasts.&nbsp; Even then, she
rarely reached above her chest and turned to one side before bending for
anything.&nbsp; This was exactly the sort of thing Brian wanted for his
work, he needed to see her discomfort and humiliation up close so he could
immortalize the emotions in his sculptures.&nbsp; He was very pleased with
Nina for volunteering to help.
<p>Soon, Nina's bags were once again packed; it was time to take them to
their new home.
<p>"Very good, ladies," Brian said with a gentle smile.&nbsp; "Grab those
bags now, and we can show Nina exactly where her clothes will be for her
stay."
<p>The women obediently grabbed a couple of bags each, and Nina was now
aware that she no longer had a hand to cover herself with.&nbsp; A part
of her felt stupid.&nbsp; She had already been seen naked by both these
people, yet it all seemed new to her again.&nbsp; With a glance at the
lease now lying on her bed, she meekly followed the housekeeper out of
the room.
<p>Stepping out of the house was a whole new experience for her as well.&nbsp;
Up to now she had just gone out in what she thought of as the relative
safety of the back of the house.&nbsp; But to get to the building where
her clothes were going meant stepping out of the front.
<p>She knew that she was as protected from casual view on this side of
the house as she was anywhere on the property, but it was still a jolt
to her system to be walking naked down the driveway with her suitcases
in her hands.&nbsp; It was as they closed in on the end of the curving
driveway that Nina realized that there was one part of the property not
so well screened.&nbsp; The gate, now closed, that blocked entrance to
the property, was not a solid structure but one of those ornamental iron
monstrosities.&nbsp; The road outside was clearly visible through the gate,
and traffic passing by would be able to see the garage at the very least.&nbsp;
Nina did note however that the house across the street wasn't visible due
to their OWN landscaping.
<p>Still, it meant that for the brief walk down this part of the driveway
she would be exposed to any passersby.&nbsp; At least this neighborhood
wasn't a high traffic one!
<p>Brian led the way into the large garage, and once again Nina got to
see the cute little car he said she could use.&nbsp; Nina looked forward
to it, especially since it meant she would be able to dress again.&nbsp;
She was so engrossed in this thought that she almost tripped on the stairs
as Brian led them up.
<p>The garage had an apartment above it, no doubt for the chauffeur when
there used to be one.&nbsp; It was here that her clothes were to be kept.&nbsp;
The apartment was small but well maintained; the kind of place Nina might
have gotten if this chance to live with Brian Cook hadn't happened.&nbsp;
But Nina figured that even a place like this would probably have been out
of her price range.&nbsp; Still, it looked cozy, and was even furnished.
<p>Her host led them to what should have been a bedroom and undid a heavy
looking door lock.
<p>"I have one key," he said with a smile.&nbsp; "Nina, your boss, Clayton
St. John-Smythe, has another, although he doesn't know what it is for.&nbsp;
He is only allowed to give up the key to Alison here in the event I'm incapacitated
in some way.&nbsp; I'll call him and let him know that he can release the
key to you too.&nbsp; It's just a precaution."
<p>"A wise one, I hope," Nina replied, staring through the now open door.&nbsp;
It was not quite what she had expected.&nbsp; What she thought she would
see was a bedroom furnished like the main room they just walked through.&nbsp;
She expected a closet somewhere where she could hang her stuff, and that
was it.
<p>Instead, what she saw was a lot more.
<p>The room HAD been a bedroom at one point, but all signs of its former
use had been erased.&nbsp; Now the place looked like one huge walk in closet,
with racks and dressers and shelves for every type of clothing imaginable;
far more space by a couple of powers of magnitude than Nina needed for
her minuscule wardrobe.&nbsp; But that was not the last of it.&nbsp; Some
of the space was already being used with clothing already on the hangers
and on the shelves.&nbsp; Nina stared at them, not knowing what was going
one.&nbsp; Whose clothes were they?
<p>She got her answer almost immediately.
<p>At a nod from Brian, Mrs. Terry, the housekeeper, began to undress.&nbsp;
Nina watched as she calmly undid the buttons on her simple housedress and
stepped out of it.
<p>"What's going on?" Nina asked, finding her voice.
<p>Mrs. Terry looked over at her, but didn't stop undressing.&nbsp; "Miss
West, you seem surprised.&nbsp; Didn't you realize that I was Mr. Cook's
FIRST model?"
<p>"But why are you getting undressed now?" asked the confused young woman.
<p>"Well Miss, I too have to earn my living here," she said, then she almost
smiled, "besides, I've been doing this so long it feels odd now to go around
wearing clothes.&nbsp; The four days you've been here have been the longest
I've worn clothes since I came to stay here.&nbsp; That was a few years
ago."
<p>"Er..." was all Nina could say in reply.
<p>Mrs. Terry finished undressing and began to hang her clothes up neatly.
<p>"Miss West, why don't you begin unpacking," she said, "I'll help you
in a moment."
<p>"Er...sure."
<p>Standing at the door, Brian Cook watched both women, seeing things neither
of them saw.&nbsp; He could tell from her body language that Nina was completely
stunned by this revelation, yet also relieved in a way that she wasn't
going to be alone in her nudity.&nbsp; He could also see that the situation
wasn't as routine as his housekeeper pretended it was.&nbsp; He could see
the faint blush creep down her still well built body at the thought of
being naked in front of the girl.
<p>He watched quietly as the two women quickly hung up Nina's clothes,
their eyes both avoiding and drawn to each other's bodies.&nbsp; Yes, he
thought, this was going to revitalize his work no end!
<p>Eventually the women were done, and they stood with nothing in their
hands, nothing on their bodies, waiting for his next instructions.
<p>"Very good," Brian said, stepping back from the door.&nbsp; "Let's go
up to the house, and have some lunch!"
<p>"I'll get started on that right away, Mr. Cook," said the housekeeper.
<p>"Thank you, Alison," replied the old man.&nbsp; He stood aside to let
her pass and then looked back into the room.
<p>Nina was just standing there, taking one last look at her clothes.&nbsp;
She knew she would be in here often to get dressed for various trips, and
when she started work, then she would be dressed for the better part of
the day almost every day.
<p>It wasn't as if she wasn't going to see them again, but it was still
hard to leave, knowing that as soon as the door closed she would not be
able to get at them when SHE wanted.
<p>"Second thoughts?"&nbsp; Brian asked her.
<p>Nina stood silent for a moment, then shook her head.&nbsp; "No," she
said as she walked out the door.
<p>"Good," was his reply as he closed the door behind them, the click of
the lock sending another shudder down Nina's spine.
<p>Without looking back, she left the building and began the long walk
back up to the house, the warm sun caressing her naked skin.&nbsp; It was
only then that she realized that the huge closet was still half empty,
even with hers and Mrs. Terry's clothes in there.&nbsp; She wondered why
her host had built such a huge closet, which made her think about who else
might be locking their clothes in there!

<br>
<p>Part 5&nbsp; The Gardeners.
<p>Nina lay out in the sun, enjoying the warm and silent Sunday while she
could.&nbsp; Back home at this time of year, it was colder, wetter, and
not nearly as much fun outdoors.&nbsp; But here, well here a girl could
just stretch out and enjoy the rays!
<p>She lay on an air mattress, the transparent kind with the reflective
coating on the bottom that allowed you to tan all over at the same time
without having to turn over a lot.&nbsp; And tan all over she did!&nbsp;
Without even a tiny bathing suit to mar her perfect skin, her sun-starved
body was getting the full treatment.&nbsp; All that covered it was a thin
layer of sunscreen, extra strong to protect those more delicate areas.
<p>The last couple of days for Nina had been odd, but thankfully uneventful.&nbsp;
After getting over the shock of finding out that the housekeeper, Mrs.
Terry, would also be spending all her time naked, Nina had attempted to
settle into some sort of routine.
<p>It had been hard, though.&nbsp; Just when the young woman had thought
she got a handle on things, she would come across Mrs. Terry doing housework
in the buff, unsettling Nina all over again.&nbsp; It looked very strange
to Nina for someone to be vacuuming a carpet naked, yet acting as if it
was all very normal.
<p>So Nina escaped outside as much as she could, either swimming in the
pool, which she had to admit, was a lot more fun to do naked, or wandering
around the grounds working on her tan.
<p>She had thought of visiting the nearby beach; by the smell of the air
it was tantalizingly close.&nbsp; But that would have meant approaching
her host, Brian Cook, for the key to her locked away clothes.
<p>That was something ELSE Nina was still trying to get her mind behind.&nbsp;
She had NOTHING to wear; nothing that she could reach easily, that is.&nbsp;
Her closets were bare, even her shoes were gone, and a check in the bathroom
showed that all her towels had been taken away except for a few wash cloths.&nbsp;
Mounted on the wall of her bathroom instead was a large hot air dryer with
a swivel nozzle.&nbsp; When Nina had to use it for the first time, dripping
wet from a shower, she felt kinda dumb pressing the big button on the side,
but as she turned and posed in front of the outlet, the warm air felt very
nice as it blew past her naked skin, and Nina had to admit that it did
its job.
<p>One bad side effect though was that she had to work moisturizer into
her skin right afterwards, because the dryer did too GOOD a job.&nbsp;
But Nina soon found that to be a pleasure rather than a chore.&nbsp; The
act of spreading and rubbing the slick liquid all over her body was soothing
and also a little arousing, especially when doing her breasts, which had
always been sensitive for her.&nbsp; When rubbing between her legs it was
VERY distracting!
<p>In fact, Nina thought this entire enterprise was distracting.&nbsp;
Now that she was getting over her initial shocks she was beginning to feel
a little turned on by her constant nudity, at least when no one else was
looking at her.
<p>Her host looked at her a lot, and at times Nina found his gaze to be
rather uncomfortable.&nbsp; But then that IS what he wanted her to feel
at times, as she understood her role.
<p>While he was old enough to be her grandfather, Nina thought that sometimes
Brian Cook looked at her like a younger man would have, not out of artistic
appreciation, but out of lust.&nbsp; Brian was a nice enough man, but Nina
fervently hoped that he was too old to do anything BUT look.
<p>Nina sighed and turned over, her naked body apparently floating in the
air on the transparent mattress.
<p>So many thoughts; her brain seemed way too full these days, as if to
make up for how bare the rest of her was.
<p>She thought about how the next day she WOULD get a chance to get dressed.&nbsp;
It was to be her first day at her new job, so she would be leaving early
in the morning to get to the office.&nbsp; She already had the outfit she
wanted picked out in her mind, something nice and non-revealing!
<p>Mmmmmmmm.
<p>The warm sun and the still air, worked slowly on her, and she began
to dose.
<p>Unknown to Nina, Sunday at the Cook household had a schedule all its
own.&nbsp; Sunday was the day Brian Cook had the gardeners in to keep up
the fantastic landscaping that surrounded the house.
<p>It was a crew of three, a family team of two brothers and their sister;
Wesley, Annabel, and Will Clark.
<p>The Clarks had arrived after lunch as usual, and began work out in front
of the house as was their custom.&nbsp; Nothing was said to Nina about
their arrival, but the Clarks were briefed in on her deal by Brian Cook
himself.&nbsp; It was nothing new to them; the family had been working
his property for years as well as many other properties in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
There wasn't much they hadn't seen already, and Cook wasn't the strangest
of the lot by far!
<p>So the crew went to work, doing their weekly maintenance efficiently
and quietly, working their way around the house to where Nina lay sleeping
in the back.
<p>Will saw her first, and had to admit he was impressed.&nbsp; The young
woman was lying on her stomach, her arms up and draped over the sides of
the mattress, her legs partially open so that her pussy was exposed.
<p>Will waved his brother over, and the two men decided to take a closer
look.&nbsp; Will always enjoyed the sight of a beautiful woman, especially
naked and especially when they didn't know he was looking.&nbsp; He loved
how vulnerable they appeared, how delicate, how...perfect they were.
<p>This one he saw, hadn't been out in the sun all that much until lately.&nbsp;
Her skin was too pale for a regular sun worshiper.&nbsp; In fact, looking
a little closer, he could see a little red tinge to her buttocks and shoulders
showing that she was getting a little TOO much sun.
<p>Grinning at his brother, Will crouched down beside Nina.&nbsp; He was
close enough now to see the fine hairs on her butt, the drops of sweat
on her skin, the way she partially revealed and covered one of her breasts
with each breath.
<p>Will was in high heaven.
<p>This wasn't the first time they had encountered naked women on this
property, but Cook had said that Nina was certainly not used to being looked
at, so they weren't to disturb her.
<p>Sighing, Will was about to get up and resume working when from behind
the two men a voice called out "What the hell are you guys doing?"
<p>Will and Wesley spun around to see their sister Annabel standing behind
them, her hands on her hips.&nbsp; She looked pissed.
<p>What they didn't see was Nina's eyes snap open, revealing to her the
two men standing not even a foot from her naked body.
<p>They did hear her scream though, and they turned to see the startled
girl leap off the mattress, her hands desperately trying to cover herself.&nbsp;
She would have used the mattress for this, but for some reason it was chained
down at a couple of spots so it couldn't be moved.
<p>Instead, Nina screamed again and headed for the nearest bush.
<p>She had NOT expected to be seen by strangers like this, especially people
as rough looking as those two men.&nbsp; She wondered if they had wondered
in off the street, not noticing their somewhat dirty uniforms.&nbsp; Nina
hadn't noticed Annabel at all!
<p>Hiding behind a bush, Nina screamed once more and started yelling at
the gardeners to go away.&nbsp; She wondered where the hell Brian was,
and hoped he would come right down to sort it all out.&nbsp; Brian was
actually at his studio window, watching all the action.&nbsp; The humiliation
shown by Nina fascinated him, and he sketched furiously on a pad so he
wouldn't lose any of it.
<p>The gardeners were in a different state of mind however.&nbsp; It had
not been their intention to scare her, and both men began waving their
hands, asking Nina to calm down.
<p>Annabel also tried to calm the frightened girl, but was having no luck.
<p>It wasn't until Mrs. Terry descended from the house right on cue that
Nina stopped panicking.
<p>"What's all the yelling about out here?" she called out from the patio.
<p>Everyone's eyes were drawn to the naked housekeeper, standing as Annabel
had done with her hands on her hips.&nbsp; She looked formidable, despite
her nudity, and Nina took solace in her presence, although she was surprised
Mrs. Terry would show herself like that in front of strangers.
<p>The gardeners weren't strangers, they were quite used to seeing the
housekeeper naked.
<p>"What's going on?" she yelled once more.
<p>"These people were staring at me!" Nina yelled back.
<p>"Of course they were," answered Mrs. Terry.&nbsp; "What do you expect
them to do when you lie out here naked, avert their eyes?"
<p>"What?" Nina asked, thoroughly confused.
<p>Mrs. Terry walked out onto the lawn.&nbsp; "Hello Annabel, Will, Wes;
I'm sorry about all this!"
<p>"That's quite alright, Mrs. Terry," said Annabel, the leader of the
group, "I think we just scared her, that's all."
<p>Nina was shocked.&nbsp; "You mean you KNOW these people?" she asked.
<p>"Of course I know them, they're our gardeners, Miss West.&nbsp; Now
come out and I'll introduce them."
<p>Nina shook her head; she didn't want to expose herself again, although
now that she actually looked at them she could see that they WERE wearing
uniforms.
<p>"You silly girl," said Mrs. Terry, "It's quite alright.&nbsp; If Mr.
Cook hadn't wanted them to see you, he would have told you stay inside.&nbsp;
Now come shake hands and apologize for scaring them!"
<p>"ME apologize!" Nina said.
<p>"Of course; don't you think you scared them as well, screaming like
that?"
<p>Nina had to think about it for a second.
<p>Annabel stepped forward, her hand out.&nbsp; "Hi, I'm sorry my brothers
frightened you, but it's okay, they're harmless really," she said with
a smile.
<p>"Er..." Nina said, eyeing the outstretched hand while still cowering
behind the bush.
<p>"Miss West," said Mrs. Terry, sounding more like Nina's mother with
every statement, "Do I have to come back there and get you?&nbsp; May I
remind you that anyone who Mr. Cook approves of seeing you, IS to see you?"
<p>Nina swallowed, remembering the lease she had signed.&nbsp; Her heart
was going a mile a minute, but she took a deep breath and forced herself
to step out from around the bush.
<p>Big smiles all round, and Annabel stepped forward and took her hand.&nbsp;
"Hi, I'm Annabel."
<p>"Pleased to meet you; I'm Nina West.&nbsp; I'm...sorry...I scared you,"
Nina replied, looking the young gardener in the eye.
<p>"Likewise," replied Annabel, taking in her body with a woman's critical
eye.
<p>Nina moved to take Will's hand next.
<p>"I'm Will Clark," he said, his eyes traveling up and down the front
of the nude young woman.
<p>Nina nodded and shook his hand.
<p>Wesley just smiled and mumbled his name.&nbsp; He was the shy one of
the family and didn't talk much.&nbsp; He was also a little less obvious
about his looks at Nina than his brother was, which the naked girl appreciated.
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded and smiled.&nbsp; "The Clarks are here every Sunday
to work on the grounds, so you'll be seeing them at least once a week while
you're here, Miss West."
<p>"Okay."&nbsp; Nina tried not to look at any of them; she was now surrounded
by dressed people while she was naked, it was an odd feeling.
<p>"Well, now that things are settled," continued Mrs. Terry, "I have coffee
and sandwiches for you all in the dining room when you are done!"
<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Terry," said Annabel, "You're too good to us!"
<p>The housekeeper beamed, quite the change from her normal sour expression.&nbsp;
"That's quite alright dear.&nbsp; Now back to work with you; and Miss West,
you be nice to these people."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," said the young woman.
<p>From up in his window, Brian Cook watched the group break up.&nbsp;
Mrs. Terry to her kitchen, the gardeners to their tasks.&nbsp; All that
was left was Nina, standing naked and alone in the middle of the lawn,
looking shocked and rather vulnerable.&nbsp; It was just the image he wanted,
and before she moved again, he had captured it in charcoal.
<p>'Yes', he thought, 'This one will work out nicely'.

<br>
<p>Part 6&nbsp;&nbsp; Groceries.
<p>Nina woke up Monday morning feeling a little nervous.&nbsp; Actually,
being nervous was nothing new to the young woman, given her living conditions
of the time, but this morning it wasn't because she would be spending another
day without clothes on.&nbsp; It was to be her first day of work.
<p>She got out of bed and left it unmade to go use the bathroom.&nbsp;
She no longer bothered to make her bed, because the night she signed her
unusual lease she discovered something additional added to it.&nbsp; A
lockable bar had been added to the foot of the bed, trapping the bedclothes
so that they couldn't be removed.&nbsp; Nina assumed it was so she couldn't
take a sheet and wrap herself if she needed to.
<p>'At least', she kept thinking, 'they let me HAVE blankets!'
<p>She went downstairs as usual and did her laps in the pool, then she
joined Mrs. Terry at the breakfast table, both women naked.&nbsp; Nina
tried to relax during this meal, but she still couldn't get over how odd
it was to sit eating with nothing on.
<p>She went up to shower and spent ten minutes under the hot air blower,
then for the first time since she got there, sat down and put on a little
make up.&nbsp; Nina was determined to look good for her first day at work.&nbsp;
All through this Nina kept thinking that she would soon be getting dressed,
and looked forward to that moment with increasing enjoyment.
<p>Finally, she was ready, and she padded barefoot out of her room in search
of her host, Brian Cook.&nbsp; The old man was the only one with the key
to the room her clothes were locked in.
<p>She found him in the dining room, having his own breakfast.
<p>"Ah," he said.&nbsp; "You look lovely this morning!"
<p>"Thank you," blushed Nina, aware that his gaze had taken in her entire
body.
<p>"I suppose you need to get to work!" he said with a smile.
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>Brian got up and led the way, walking slowly out the front of the house
toward the detached garage at the end of the driveway.
<p>Nina wished he would hurry up, anxious to be dressed and off, but found
herself enjoying the walk.&nbsp; The brick driveway felt cool beneath her
feet, the sun not having risen enough to warm it yet, and the air had a
certain crispness to it that made her more alert.&nbsp; The only bad part
of it all was the approach near the main gate.&nbsp; At least a couple
of cars passed by while she was in sight of the road, and Nina hoped that
she hadn't been seen parading down the driveway in the all together.
<p>Brian led her inside the garage and up the stairs, where he unlocked
the door that held Nina's modesty.
<p>As quickly as she could, she picked out the outfit she had been thinking
of for two days, and put it on.&nbsp; The clothes felt a little strange
after so much time naked, but they also felt good to her.
<p>Brian Cook, on the other hand, shook his head and sighed.
<p>"Nina, my dear, you look so much better without those clothes on, but
I think that if you have to wear clothes at all, we need to find you something
more suitable."
<p>Nina stopped and looked down at her suit.&nbsp; It had served her very
well at college, and she wondered what Brian was talking about.
<p>"What's the matter with this?" she asked him.
<p>"It's fine as it goes, but the atmosphere at the Firm is one of affluence,
and if you need to meet with a client, it would serve you better if you
dressed the part.&nbsp; We'll have to go shopping soon for some better
work clothes, young Nina."
<p>"I'm sorry!" Nina said, a little put out by the insult to her clothing.
<p>"That's quite alright; I know we'll get you sorted out."
<p>Nina grumbled to herself as she finished, and walked down to the car
she was going to use.&nbsp; She was just beginning to perk up a bit with
the knowledge that she was getting the use of such a nice vehicle, when
she noticed the bag in the front passenger seat.&nbsp; It wasn't hers.&nbsp;
A couple of days before she had put her ancient laptop, the one she used
as a reference book for her work, and the bag it came in, in the car ready
for today.&nbsp; What greeted her was something brand new.
<p>She turned to Brian who was smiling.
<p>"I took the liberty," said the old man, "of picking up a gift for you,
something to welcome you to the Firm.&nbsp; I had everything on your old
machine transferred, but this one I'm told is a much better model.&nbsp;
I'm too old to really know about such things, but my grand daughter swears
by this brand."
<p>Nina was delighted; her old machine had pretty much reached its limits.
<p>"Oh THANK you, Brian.&nbsp; It's a wonderful gift!"&nbsp; She hugged
the old man, and the couple danced about a bit before she got in the car.
<p>"I'll see you tonight," Brian said, "just leave your clothes on the
hooks by the door up there, and I'll lock them away once I know you're
home.&nbsp; You have a good first day!"
<p>Nina's good mood faltered a little with the reminder that she would
be stripping again, but it was soon out of her mind again as she drove
the cute little Geo to work.
<p>Brian was right, it WAS a good day.&nbsp; She met her new boss, one
of the senior partners, and after dealing with a senior secretary who doubled
as the company personnel officer, Nina was placed in a large office that
she was to share with three other Paralegals.
<p>Two girls and one guy, they all greeted her in a friendly manner.&nbsp;
But Nina could tell looking in their eyes that they didn't think much of
the quality of her suit.&nbsp; All of them were very fashionably dressed,
and Nina couldn't help admiring the cut of their outfits.&nbsp; But the
day got better as she was shown the ropes and introduced to her duties.
<p>She lunched with the group, and after telling her new workmates where
she was from, one of the women, Helen, promised to take Nina shopping herself.&nbsp;
"I'm a small town girl myself," Helen had told her, "and I know how it
is not to fit in right away.&nbsp; But believe me, if you dress the part
that's most of the battle!"
<p>Nina was glad to find a friend, and was happier that it was someone
who understood her roots.
<p>By the end of the day she was mentally tired from the on the job training,
and physically keyed up for something more.&nbsp; As she drove home, she
focused on having a swim to ease the tension in her muscles, and she drove
through the automatic gate and parked the car without thinking.
<p>She had almost reached the house when the world intruded on her thoughts
with a loud crack.
<p>"NINA!"
<p>Nina jumped and looked up.&nbsp; It was Brian, standing in the front
door looking rather disappointed in her.&nbsp; It only dawned on Nina then
that she had completely forgotten to get undressed back at the garage;
she was still in her work suit.
<p>"Oh God, I'm sorry!" she said.&nbsp; "I'll go change at once!"
<p>"Why?" Brian said.&nbsp; "You've already broken your lease, and you've
barely started!"
<p>"But, I just forgot," said the young woman.
<p>Brian frowned.&nbsp; "Forgetting things is not good for someone in your
line of work.&nbsp; Especially something as important as this!"
<p>"I'm sorry!"
<p>Brian gave a deep sigh.&nbsp; "Okay, well I guess there will be a few
slip ups at the beginning, I can't expect miracles.&nbsp; But just to remind
you of the importance of what you are doing, I want you to undress right
where you're standing, and take those clothes back to the garage before
coming in the house.&nbsp; I also think I'll have you go grocery shopping
with Mrs. Terry later this evening, she could use the help."
<p>"Yes, sir, I'll be happy to," said the young woman.
<p>Brian nodded.&nbsp; "Well, go ahead then!"
<p>Nina stood blankly for a moment, then realized that he meant to stay
where he was while she undressed.&nbsp; Her heart thumping, Nina slowly
pulled her clothes off, quite conscious of the fact that she was undressing
for a man outside in the great outdoors.
<p>It mortified her, but she did it anyway, and soon she was completely
naked.&nbsp; She crouched, flashing her pussy at Brian, to pick up her
discarded clothing, and padded back the way she had come.
<p>Watching her go, Brian smiled.
<p>---***---
<p>It was later that evening, the sun had gone down a while ago, and Nina
was toying with her new laptop.&nbsp; She was lying naked on the bed, one
shapely foot up in the air behind her.
<p>She was about to give up and get ready for bed, thinking that it was
too late to go anywhere, especially grocery shopping.&nbsp; But then there
was a knock at her door.
<p>"Come in!" Nina said, aware that she was inviting someone into her room
while she had nothing on.
<p>Mrs. Terry stepped in.&nbsp; "I'm told you're supposed to come shopping
with me tonight, Miss West," said the naked housekeeper.
<p>"Yes, but isn't it a bit late now?" Nina asked.
<p>"Not at all, I always go at this time on a Monday night.&nbsp; Now come
along!"
<p>Nina slid off the bed and followed the older woman out of the house.&nbsp;
As they walked together to the garage, Nina looked about for Brian Cook.&nbsp;
He wasn't anywhere to be seen, so Nina assumed he was meeting them at the
garage to give them their clothes.
<p>She was wrong.
<p>Inside the garage, Mrs. Terry headed for her Ford sedan while Nina looked
up at the room where their clothes were.&nbsp; Brian wasn't anywhere to
be seen and the room was definitely locked.
<p>"Err..." Nina began, fear closing her heart.
<p>"Come on, Miss West, I want to get back in time for Conan!"
<p>"Mrs. Terry, aren't we supposed to get dressed first?"
<p>"It's really not necessary, Miss West."
<p>"Not necessary?&nbsp; Of course it's necessary to be dressed to go out;
there are laws against nudity, aren't there?"
<p>Mrs. Cook smiled.&nbsp; "I suppose so, but then in this community the
people make their own from time to time.&nbsp; Now, no one is going to
call the police on us, we're just going out for groceries.&nbsp; Get in
the car or stay here, I really don't care.&nbsp; But Mr. Cook wanted you
to come with me, and I'm sure he had his reasons."
<p>'That was it wasn't it', she thought, 'THIS was the punishment for not
getting undressed earlier'.&nbsp; Nina had thought it was Brian's kindness
that had let her keep her lease, but he was actually going to teach her
a lesson.
<p>Nina debated on what would happen if she stayed, and it didn't look
pretty.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mrs. Terry seemed perfectly at ease with
driving out of here naked and going shopping, so maybe there wasn't any
risk to it all?
<p>Nina didn't have any longer to think of it as the housekeeper started
her car.&nbsp; Nina just had time to run over and climb in before they
left.
<p>---***---
<p>The drive in the darkness wasn't quite as bad as Nina thought it would
be at first, but then Nina thought that she would shrivel up and die.&nbsp;
The street lights lit up her body inside the car, and she was sure that
each house they passed, each car they met on the street, had a direct view
of her naked body.
<p>She slouched down in the seat as much as she could, which wasn't much
since Mrs. Terry had insisted the girl wear her seat belt, and tried to
look invisible.
<p>Mrs. Terry on the other hand, sat us straight and acted as if she drove
naked every day.&nbsp; Nina wondered if she did.
<p>Mrs. Terry glanced over at Nina and her normally sour face smiled.&nbsp;
"It's okay, Miss West, you're quite safe, and I can prove it to you.&nbsp;
Look at the cars that go by, I'll give you ten dollars if you can tell
me what anyone is wearing.
<p>Nina looked puzzled for a moment, then focused on the cars going the
other way on the street.&nbsp; Try as she might, she couldn't quite see
into them from a distance, and when they WERE close enough, they went by
too fast to get a good look anyway.&nbsp; She then realized that if she
couldn't see them, then they couldn't see her, and she relaxed.
<p>"Do you do this a lot?" Nina asked, "Do you leave the house naked a
lot?"
<p>"As much as I can, Miss West," replied the housekeeper.
<p>"Why?" asked the girl.
<p>Mrs. Terry paused, thinking.&nbsp; "Since my husband died, there is
very little in my life that truly engages me," she said slowly, "but after
Mr. Cook asked me to be his model, I began to find that being nude all
the time gave me a certain thrill.&nbsp; It...filled me, if you understand
what I mean.&nbsp; But eventually just going about the house wasn't quite
enough anymore, so I started venturing out a bit."
<p>"Did you ever get in trouble?"
<p>Mrs. Terry smiled.&nbsp; "Only once, I'll have to tell you about it
some time.&nbsp; Here we are!"
<p>They pulled into a parking lot in front of a brightly lit store.&nbsp;
It wasn't a large grocery store, but it was big enough, and to make it
worse it was occupied.
<p>Nina had hoped that maybe some special shopping hours had been arranged,
so they could use the store in peace, but apparently not, it was still
open for business.
<p>"I can't go out there," Nina said, gripping the door in panic.
<p>"Of course you can, Miss West, no one will harm you."
<p>"But they'll see me!"
<p>"Well, that's the whole point!" said the housekeeper with a smile.
<p>Nina looked at her.&nbsp; "But only Brian was supposed to see me like
this!"
<p>"Miss West...Nina...don't you want to enjoy this?&nbsp; Think about
it, when have you ever felt more alive than you do now?"
<p>Nina felt alive, so alive she thought her heart was going to burst,
it was beating so hard.&nbsp; "I can't."
<p>Mrs. Terry sighed.&nbsp; "I'll be right back," she said and she opened
the door and got out.
<p>Nina watched her walk normally to the store, purse in hand.&nbsp; She
got a few looks from the other shoppers entering and leaving the store,
but otherwise no one commented on her nudity.
<p>Nina was puzzled, but she felt herself calming down now that she wasn't
being asked to get out of the car.&nbsp; Then she saw the housekeeper appear
once more at the front of the store, and with her was an older man in an
apron.&nbsp; To Nina's horror they were coming right back to the car.
<p>Nina looked around for something, anything to cover herself up with,
but saw nothing she could use.&nbsp; So she cringed and resigned herself
to be seen naked by another stranger.
<p>Mrs. Terry walked up to her car door and opened it, revealing the young
woman's body to the man.&nbsp; "Miss West, this is Mr. Diotelli, the owner
of the store and a good friend of both myself and Mr. Cook.&nbsp; Mr. Diotelli,
this is Nina West, who is staying with us and acting as Mr. Cook's new
model.
<p>"Ah Nina, un nome cosi' bello, tipicamente italiano.&nbsp; Parli italiano,
bellissima Nina ?" said the old man, clearly pleased to see her, and enchanted
by her Italian sounding name.
<p>"Si, ma solo un po.&nbsp; Mio nonno era italiano, e voleva che io parlassi
un po di italiano" Nina replied slowly.&nbsp; It had been years since she
spoke much of her grandfather's first language, but the old man had insisted
she learn and the lessons stuck.
<p>Mr. Diotelli beamed and held out his hands.&nbsp; "Lo parli benissimo,
Nina, come la Madonna stessa!" he said, impressed with the young beauty
in the car, and more for her language skills than her pretty young body.
<p>Nina blushed at the compliment, enjoying the fact that while he was
getting a good look at all she had he was more interested in talking about
how well she spoke the language.
<p>"Grazie, signor Diotelli, but I think I'll stick with English for now,
my Italian is rusty."
<p>The storeowner laughed.&nbsp; "Si, that is fine.&nbsp; English is more
practical but not as beautiful for sure."
<p>Nina couldn't help grinning.
<p>"Alison here tells me that you no want to come inside?"
<p>Nina paled.&nbsp; "I can't, I'm not dressed!"
<p>Diotelli through up his hands.&nbsp; "It no matter, young Nina, not
tonight.&nbsp; You come, eh, see that it is okay.&nbsp; You be fine, I
promise.&nbsp; Come, it is a nice store."
<p>With Diotelli urging her on and Mrs. Terry watching, Nina found herself
unbuckling her seat belt and climbing out of the car.&nbsp; The storeowner
beamed once more and led the two naked ladies across the parking lot and
inside.
<p>All the way there, Nina looked around to see who could see her and then
avoided the eyes of those who could.&nbsp; But as they started their shopping,
she realized that no one was making a big deal out her being naked.&nbsp;
Eventually she had to ask the question that had been bothering her all
night.
<p>"How is it we can do this?" she asked Mrs. Terry, who was pushing the
grocery cart.
<p>"Mr. Diotelli has been here for years," said the housekeeper, "and has
earned a certain trust from most of the community that has also been here
for years.&nbsp; He indulges some of us, every Monday night, by allowing
some of the community to be a little freer than his usual customers.&nbsp;
Notice, no children here tonight; those who have them know not to bring
them.&nbsp; Also, no one is hassling us, anyone who does deals with him,
and it's rumored he has connections.&nbsp; I don't know if they're true,
but people believe it anyway and it keeps the riffraff out.&nbsp; Oh, and
don't be fooled by his "Just off the boat" act.&nbsp; That man is as smart
and as shrewd as they come.&nbsp; Also, we're not alone in here, look!"
<p>The housekeeper pointed at a normal looking couple in the aisle ahead
of them, and Nina wondered what was wrong with them.&nbsp; Then she noticed
the woman.&nbsp; She was normally dressed, but both her hands were handcuffed
to the cart she was pushing.
<p>Nina looked about.&nbsp; She saw a couple that had to be wearing each
other's clothes, another that appeared to be in tight rubber.&nbsp; Going
around a corner, they almost bumped into a rotund middle-aged man who was
also naked.&nbsp; He smiled and nodded at Mrs. Terry who nodded back.
<p>"Who are these people?" Nina asked.
<p>"Some of them are our neighbors," replied the housekeeper.
<p>They eventually went through the checkout, and Diotelli helped them
load their groceries in the car himself.
<p>"You come back next week, huh?" he said with a smile at Nina.
<p>The young woman nodded without thinking.
<p>"Good!"&nbsp; He surprised her by giving her and Mrs. Terry a quick
hug before hurrying back into his store.
<p>The women climbed in the car and started back to the house.
<p>"Miss West, tell me honestly.&nbsp; Was there a moment there when you
were able to relax and actually enjoy what happened to you tonight?"
<p>Nina looked out the window.&nbsp; Had she enjoyed it?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 7,&nbsp; New Clothes.
<p>Another workday over, Nina was once again in the pool behind the house
she shared with her host, Brian Cook, and his housekeeper, Mrs. Terry.
<p>Nina swam naked, not by choice but because of the unusual lease she
had signed over a week before.&nbsp; Instead of money, her rent was to
be paid by providing a service.&nbsp; She was to always be naked when at
home, her clothes locked away from her and under the control of Brian Cook.
<p>Since Nina couldn't have afforded a decent place to live in the rich
community she lived and worked in, she took the deal and now spent more
time nude than she had ever done in her life.
<p>Sometimes it wasn't a problem, and the athletic young woman especially
liked swimming naked.&nbsp; But there were other times when her nudity
had been difficult to bear.
<p>Such as...
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"My God!&nbsp; Nina?" said the voice, interrupting Nina's steady crawl
from one end of the pool to the other.
<p>Nina jumped and stopped swimming, frantically turning in the water to
see who had called out to her.&nbsp; With a shock, she recognized the young
woman standing with her host as Helen, one of the paralegals she worked
with at the firm.
<p>Helen was dressed in a bright yellow sundress with matching accessories
and was standing with one hand on her mouth, a very surprised look on her
face.
<p>Nina immediately began blushing, knowing that Helen could easily see
that she was naked in the clear water.&nbsp; She also groaned, thinking
that soon news of this moment would soon spread quickly through the firm
and her reputation ruined.
<p>Nina glared at Brian for a second before swimming to the side of the
pool.&nbsp; He had promised her that she would not be embarrassed at the
firm, but now it seemed it would happen anyway.
<p>"Nina, why are you swimming with no clothes on?" Helen asked, a curious
smile on her face.
<p>"Er..." Nina began, wondering how she was to explain it.&nbsp; Brian
came to her rescue.
<p>"Nina likes a good work out, Helen, and swimming nude gives her the
best.&nbsp; Besides, she doesn't have to worry about being seen here, do
you now, Nina?" he said with a smile.
<p>Nina had not found that to be entirely true, but she nodded anyway.
<p>Helen laughed.&nbsp; "Well, I guess there is nothing wrong with skinny
dipping in your own back yard, there was a watering hole near my place
back home where we went to as kids.&nbsp; But I didn't think you were the
type, Nina!"
<p>"You never know, do you," Nina replied softly.
<p>Helen giggled again.&nbsp; "Well don't worry, Honey, your secret is
safe with me.&nbsp; But you had better get dressed, we're supposed to go
shopping tonight, remember?"
<p>Nina had actually forgotten about the date she made with Helen a couple
of days earlier, and mentally kicked herself.&nbsp; She held on to the
side of the pool, screening her body.&nbsp; "Sure, I'll be dressed in a
little bit," she said, looking over at Brian and wondering what next.
<p>Brian, who was enjoying the discomfort Nina felt, had already taken
matters into his own hands.&nbsp; He had been surprised at the arrival
of Helen at the main gate, and had briefly considered warning Nina before
allowing the girl in.&nbsp; But Brian knew Helen from when he was a partner
at the firm, and knew that Helen could be discreet.
<p>"Nina," he said, "why don't you go upstairs and put on something nice
for your trip, I'm sure you'll find something appropriate."
<p>"But..." Nina said, knowing that she didn't have any clothes up in her
room; they were all locked away in a room over the garage at the main gate.
<p>"Don't worry.&nbsp; I'll entertain young Helen here while you dress.&nbsp;
You'll find what you need upstairs."&nbsp; Brian gave her a steady look
and Nina knew that he meant her to get out of the pool in front of them
and walk naked and wet into the house.&nbsp; Nina didn't have a towel outside
to dry with, she didn't have any towels.
<p>Nina looked at Helen, the only friend she had made so far at the firm,
and knew she had no choice.&nbsp; Along with being naked all the time,
she also had to appear this way before anyone Brian Cook wanted.&nbsp;
So, swallowing her pride, Nina hoisted herself out of the water and stood
dripping on the patio.
<p>Helen blushed and glanced away, before looking back at her new friend.&nbsp;
She felt somewhat out of her depth as well.&nbsp; At first it was only
because she was at the home of a retired senior partner of the law firm
she worked at, but now it was because of seeing Nina with nothing on at
all.
<p>Nina gave Helen a sheepish smile.&nbsp; "I'll be right back," she said.&nbsp;
And she padded across the patio and into the house as both Helen and Brian
watched her go.&nbsp; Nina went straight up to her room, her body reflected
a thousand times in all the mirrors that covered most of the wall space
inside the house.&nbsp; She also knew that through many of the huge windows
the house had to offer, her image could be easily seen.&nbsp; She figured
that Helen, if she looked, could probably follow her image all the way
up to her room.
<p>In her room, Nina got a surprise.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry, the housekeeper
was already waiting for her.&nbsp; What DIDN'T surprise Nina was that Mrs.
Terry was nude.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry was also required to be naked on the property,
but unlike Nina, Mrs. Terry had made the surprising revelation a few days
before that she preferred being this way.
<p>What DID surprise Nina was that Mrs. Terry was laying out some clothes
on Nina's bed.
<p>"Hi, where did that come from?" Nina asked.&nbsp; It was one of her
own cotton summer dresses, one of her nice ones with the neck strap and
bare shoulders.
<p>"Mr. Cook sent me to get it and some shoes for you to wear on your shopping
trip, Miss West," replied the dour Mrs. Terry.
<p>Nina was relieved.&nbsp; She had been wondering how she was to explain
to Helen that she had to go all the way to the garage to find something
to wear.
<p>"Thanks," Nina said, "I really appreciate this.&nbsp; Just let me quickly
shower and dry off."
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded and left the room.&nbsp; Nina jumped in the shower
of her private bathroom and quickly rinsed the pool chemicals off her skin,
before standing in front of the hot air blower she used instead of towels.
<p>In minutes, she was ready and back in her room, eager to be dressed.&nbsp;
She picked up her dress and looked down for her underwear but didn't see
any.&nbsp; Instead, there was an envelope with a note and a plastic card.&nbsp;
The note looked hastily written but was legible.
<p>"Nina.&nbsp; You should have warned me we were having company, but no
matter.&nbsp; I've taken the liberty of picking this dress out for you
to wear this evening.&nbsp; You can wear it quite easily without panties
or bra, so I didn't bother having Alison retrieve them for you.&nbsp; The
card is a store credit card where I opened an account for you yesterday.&nbsp;
Your bills there will be paid out of the money you get from me at the end
of your lease.&nbsp; You can shop there and purchase anything you wish
whenever you want.&nbsp; I do however ask that for this trip you refrain
from buying any underwear.&nbsp; You have plenty already and don't need
more.
<p>Helen will tell you what you need to pick up for the office.
<p>Brian."
<p>Nina read the note and smiled.&nbsp; She had wondered if her meager
budget would stretch to cover the kinds of styles her co-workers wore,
and now that was no longer a concern.&nbsp; But running around town in
nothing but this single dress did worry her.&nbsp; Without looking at the
credit card, she slipped on her dress and shivered a little as the material
slid down her naked skin.&nbsp; It felt very odd wearing the dress with
nothing on underneath, but it beat going naked.&nbsp; Looking at herself
in her mirror, she could see that nothing showed that wasn't supposed to,
and Nina relaxed.
<p>She slipped her sandals on, and taking the credit card, went back down
stairs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I thought we'd stop at 'Mylars', or 'The Gap'," Helen said as they
raced down the highway in her little convertible.
<p>Nina had one hand on her lap, holding her skirt down in the windy car,
not wanting to reveal to her friend that she wore nothing underneath it.&nbsp;
Her other hand clutched her purse.&nbsp; "That would be cool," Nina replied,
"but I just got an account at another store and I want to try it out."
<p>"What store?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina looked in her purse at the credit card she had been given.&nbsp;
"It's called...'IO'."
<p>Helen did a double take.&nbsp; "You're kidding!"
<p>"What?&nbsp; Why should I be kidding?" Nina said, a little worried at
Helen's reaction.
<p>"You HAVE to be kidding.&nbsp; YOU have a card to 'IO'?&nbsp; This I
have to see!"&nbsp; Helen pulled over to the side of the highway and stopped
even though there was no real place to park.&nbsp; She held out her hand
and Nina obediently handed over the black plastic card.&nbsp; While Helen
examined it, Nina looked around and recognized this highway as the one
she and Mrs. Terry had taken to get to the grocery store.&nbsp; It made
Nina smile a little to think that the last time she had been down that
way she had been completely naked.
<p>"You lucky bitch!" Helen exclaimed.&nbsp; "How did you manage to get
a card to that store?"
<p>"Mr. Cook got it for me.&nbsp; Why, is it a special place?" Nina asked.
<p>"You've never heard of 'IO'?&nbsp; Well I guess that's not too surprising,
he only sells locally.&nbsp; But damn it Nina, I'd kill for a chance to
shop there.&nbsp; His place is very exclusive, more like a private club
than a clothes store, and his designs are to die for!"
<p>"Is it expensive?" Nina wondered if she was going to squander her money
on clothing that was way out of her budget.
<p>"It's not that, it's just the fact that he only makes one-offs, no one
ever gets what someone else has.&nbsp; And NO one gets through the door
without one of these!" she said, waving the card around.
<p>"It sounds expensive to me," Nina said, "maybe we should try 'The Gap'."
<p>"Are you KIDDING!&nbsp; No way, honey, it's to 'IO' we go!"
<p>Helen fired up the engine again and off they went.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The store was unassuming, with nothing in the windows but some very
nice artwork and the name of the store in neon.&nbsp; It occupied a building
all by itself near a shopping Mall and just happened to be across the street
from Diotelli's Groceries.
<p>Remembering how naked she was the last time she was there, and how this
time she only wore a light dress, Nina climbed cautiously out of the Volkswagen
convertible.
<p>"I'm told you have to have an appointment to get it, but I don't know
if that is true or not," Helen said, grabbing her purse out of the back
seat.
<p>"Maybe we should come back after I've made one," Nina said, still nervous
for some reason.
<p>Helen grinned.&nbsp; "No way.&nbsp; We're here; let's see if they throw
us out.&nbsp; Correction, throw ME out.&nbsp; After all, it's your card!"
<p>"They wouldn't do that," Nina said uncertainly.
<p>The two women approached the door and went in.&nbsp; Inside they found
themselves in a smart looking lobby with several chairs scattered about
and a desk at one end with a curtained doorway behind it.&nbsp; Seated
at the desk was an older woman in a rather stylish business suit, who stood
up at their entry.
<p>"Hello, how can I help you," she said.
<p>"Hi," said Nina, rather impressed by the lobby although it didn't look
like any shop she had ever seen, "I was hoping to do a little shopping!"
<p>The woman's face took on a haughty look as she spied the cut of Nina's
dress.&nbsp; "Then may I suggest the Mall next door, I'm sure they will
have something to your taste."
<p>Nina bristled; she knew when she was being talked down to and didn't
like it.&nbsp; Armed with the knowledge her friend Helen had given her
though, Nina thought she knew just how to respond.&nbsp; She reached into
her purse and pulled out the credit card.&nbsp; "Well, I was in the neighborhood
and just thought I'd drop in!"
<p>The woman's eyes immediately locked on to the card, and her expression
changed to one of shock before assuming something a little friendlier.
<p>Helen giggled, also aware of their change in 'status' now that Nina
had revealed her card.
<p>"I'm sorry," said the woman, "I thought I knew most of our clientele
on sight.&nbsp; My name is Dorothy.&nbsp; Did you have an appointment?"
<p>Nina's tight smile faded.&nbsp; "No, I don't, sorry.&nbsp; I wasn't
expecting to drop in today."
<p>Dorothy's smug look returned.&nbsp; "I see.&nbsp; Well, we are by appointment
only, and at the moment are rather booked up.&nbsp; Perhaps we can schedule
something for you in a week's time?"
<p>Nina was about to open her mouth when she saw a man step through the
curtain and answer for her.
<p>"I don't think that's necessary, Dorothy.&nbsp; We just had that cancellation,
remember?&nbsp; I'm sure I can see these young ladies now."
<p>Dorothy turned, looking a little miffed.&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. IO.&nbsp; But
I thought that you wanted this time free!"
<p>"I'd much prefer getting to know a new customer."&nbsp; IO smiled at
Nina and Helen, and they automatically smiled back, although the response
wasn't hard to give.
<p>IO was an older man, but handsome in a Mel Gibson sense.&nbsp; He also
gave off that air of masculinity that women enjoyed being around.&nbsp;
Nina knew that even though he made women's clothes, there was nothing feminine
about IO.
<p>He stood to one side and opened the curtain.&nbsp; "If you would care
to follow me?"
<p>Nina stepped forward, but Helen hesitated.&nbsp; "Am I allowed?&nbsp;
It's just that it's Nina's card, not mine."
<p>IO looked at Helen, then inclined his head toward Nina.&nbsp; "Normally
guests wait here, but it's entirely up to...Nina, was it?"
<p>Nina nodded, then turned to Helen.&nbsp; "Please come!"
<p>Helen smiled and joined her friend, and they passed by Dorothy without
another word.
<p>The group walked along a curtained hallway and Nina wondered where all
the clothes were.&nbsp; She wanted to see what kinds of creations this
man could come up with.&nbsp; But instead, they entered a large room with
several mirrors and bolts of fabric scattered about.
<p>"Now I know you haven't been here before, Nina, nor your friend..."
<p>"Helen."
<p>"...Helen.&nbsp; My name is IO, and this is my humble store.&nbsp; Have
you heard of me?"
<p>"Yes, Sir," Nina replied.&nbsp; "Helen told me all about you on the
drive over."
<p>IO laughed.&nbsp; "I doubt she knows everything about me," he said with
a grin.&nbsp; "But before I explain what we do here, can I ask where you
got the charge card you waved in Dorothy's face?&nbsp; I could tell it
surprised her, and well it should.&nbsp; She is the one who issues them!"
<p>"My...a friend got the card for me yesterday.&nbsp; I'm staying with
him for a while.&nbsp; His name is Brian Cook."
<p>"Ah, Brian.&nbsp; Yes, now I understand.&nbsp; I've attended many functions
in his wonderful house.&nbsp; You must be his new model!"
<p>"Model?" Helen asked, looking at Nina curiously.
<p>"Er...yeah," Nina replied, blushing.
<p>"What do you mean, model?" asked Helen.
<p>IO answered for Nina.&nbsp; "Mr. Cook is a talented artist and often
has a live-in model for inspiration of his work."
<p>"I'm actually here to work at his old law firm," Nina added, "But at
home he has asked me to model for him, occasionally."
<p>"Oh," said Helen.
<p>IO grinned.&nbsp; "I've met one or two of his former models already,
so I know how demanding a job that can be!"&nbsp; He looked straight at
Nina, and she knew right then that IO knew exactly what she was going through
at her new home.&nbsp; He KNEW that she spent all her time there naked,
and she began blush further.
<p>IO clapped his hands once.&nbsp; "But, to business.&nbsp; What I do
here is create.&nbsp; Each outfit tailored to the person it is for.&nbsp;
Everything unique.&nbsp; You can trust yourself in my hands.&nbsp; Now
what do you need?"
<p>"Er..." Nina said, her mind going blank for a moment.
<p>"New work clothes," Helen said.&nbsp; "She's a paralegal at the firm,
as am I, and she needs to dress up from what she already has.&nbsp; Maybe
two or three full outfits to start out with.&nbsp; From what little I've
seen," Helen winked playfully at Nina, "she's fine with her casual clothes,
but I think a nice formal gown would also be in order.&nbsp; No doubt she
will soon be invited to a party up here, and I doubt her wardrobe would
be up to it.&nbsp; No offense, Nina.&nbsp; But coming here from a small
town myself, I understand what it is to be underdressed."
<p>Nina thought that Helen didn't know WHAT it was to be so underdressed
that you spent most of your time naked.&nbsp; But the idea of a nice formal
gown appealed to her, and she forgot about being concerned about the price.
<p>"Is that about right, Nina?" IO asked her.
<p>"Yes, that's right."
<p>IO smiled.&nbsp; "A simple matter.&nbsp; I'll just need to get some
measurements from you.&nbsp; Could you remove your dress and stand over
there?" he said pointing at the center of the room.
<p>Nina flushed.&nbsp; "Er, I can just tell you my measurements."
<p>"Nonsense.&nbsp; How can I create for you if I don't know what shape
you are?" IO asked, digging a tape measure from a pocket.&nbsp; Actually,
his expert eye had already taken most of the measurements he needed, as
the simple dress Nina wore did little to hide her excellent figure.&nbsp;
But there were always a few more.
<p>"Couldn't I just look in a catalog?" Nina said, knowing that to remove
the dress meant getting naked again.
<p>"You insult me, Nina.&nbsp; If that is what you want, then you might
as well go to that monstrosity of a Mall next door!"
<p>"Nina," Helen whispered, "what the hell are you doing?&nbsp; Do you
know how many women would sell their children to be where you are right
now?"
<p>Nina looked from one to the other and back, her panic rising.&nbsp;
"It's just that...that...I...I don't have...anything on under the dress."
<p>Helen looked shocked for a second, the stifled a giggle.&nbsp; "Nina,
don't tell me you're going commando!"
<p>Nina blushed and nodded, and Helen began to laugh.
<p>IO on the other hand just looked bored.&nbsp; "That really doesn't matter,
Nina, if your underwear had gotten in the way, I would have asked you to
remove it anyway.&nbsp; Now come on, lose the dress and let me measure
you!"
<p>Helen calmed down and also urged Nina to do it.&nbsp; So Nina carefully
undid the strap around her neck and let the dress fall to the floor.&nbsp;
Once again she was naked among strangers.
<p>Helen blushed a little, amazed that her new friend was so casual about
her body that she went out wearing just one item of clothing.&nbsp; Then,
looking at Nina's athletic build, Helen figured why not, if she looked
like that!
<p>Nina, blushing from head to toe, padded to the center of the room and
stood still while IO measured her.&nbsp; His hands, throughout the course
of the measurements, found their way into almost every nook and cranny,
yet Nina was relieved to find out that not once did IO seem touch her without
good reason.&nbsp; He took no opportunities to feel her up that she could
tell.
<p>He measured her standing, sitting and reaching in various directions,
and after a while Nina grew comfortable with her nudity once more.&nbsp;
It was only when she made occasional eye contact with Helen that she became
aware of how naked she was.&nbsp; She fervently hoped that Helen would
keep her mouth shut about all this at work.
<p>It was as IO was finishing up that Dorothy stepped into the room.&nbsp;
She gave the nude girl a complete once over then didn't look at her again.&nbsp;
"Your 9 pm is here, Mr. IO," she said before departing.
<p>IO ignored her and got his last measurement.&nbsp; "Very good, Nina.&nbsp;
I'll have the first work suit ready for you in a week, and you can come
try it on."
<p>"Er...don't I get a say in how it looks?" Nina asked.
<p>"TRUST me!" IO said, holding her hands.&nbsp; He smiled and Nina smiled
back.&nbsp; "Very good.&nbsp; Now I have another client waiting.&nbsp;
The two of you can exit through the other door."&nbsp; IO escorted the
two lovely ladies to another curtained doorway and through a steel door
he closed behind them.&nbsp; It was only then that Nina realized what had
happened.
<p>"Didn't you pick up my dress?" Nina said to Helen.
<p>Helen looked shocked.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, I didn't even think!"&nbsp;
She tried the door but it was locked.&nbsp; It didn't even have a handle
for entry.&nbsp; The two women were in a small anteroom, and through a
tinted glass door they could see the parking lot.
<p>"Shit," Helen said, "I'm sorry!"
<p>"I NEED my dress, I can't go home like this!" Nina said.&nbsp; But in
the back of her mind, she knew she had already made this journey naked
before, but that was in full darkness in an enclosed car, not in daylight
or what was left of it, and in a convertible.
<p>"Tell you what," said Helen, "I'll go around front and get Dorothy to
go in and get your dress.&nbsp; You wait here!"
<p>"Thanks, Helen, like I could do anything else."
<p>Helen grinned, and went out the other door.
<p>Now Nina was alone, and for the first time felt the full vulnerability
of her position.&nbsp; She was naked in a strange place, with no one she
knew, no means of dressing or getting home.&nbsp; For all she knew Helen
might just run off and leave her here, laughing at her the next day at
work.&nbsp; Nina doubted she could handle the humiliation.
<p>She thought, if push came to shove, that she might risk a run to the
front of the store itself, but didn't want to do that.&nbsp; There was
also the possibility of crossing the street to see Mr. Diotelli, but she
was even less enthusiastic about THAT plan.
<p>Nina's panic was just about to rise when she spotted Helen's car pull
close up by the outside door.&nbsp; Helen jumped out and came in.
<p>"The bitch won't let me in!" Helen said.
<p>"What?"&nbsp; Nina asked, not believing her ears.
<p>"She won't let me in, and she won't go get your dress.&nbsp; Says IO
is in an important meeting and she can't interrupt."
<p>"But...I'm naked.&nbsp; Do you have anything I can wrap up in?"
<p>"Sorry, no.&nbsp; Look, it'll be okay.&nbsp; Once we're out of the shopping
district, it's empty highway most of the way back."
<p>"You're not suggesting I ride back naked are you?" Nina said, knowing
in her heart that was indeed what was going to happen.
<p>"No other way, Honey.&nbsp; The Mall just closed, so we can't buy you
anything else to wear.&nbsp; We can do it!"
<p>"We can't!"
<p>Helen looked down.&nbsp; "Tell you what.&nbsp; How about this," she
said after a moment.&nbsp; Helen began fumbling at the fasteners of her
dress and Nina watched amazed as her friend began to undress.&nbsp; Under
her sundress she was topless, but she wore sensible panties which she slowly
removed until she too stood naked.&nbsp; Helen was blushing furiously,
but she stood with her arms at her sides.
<p>"What are you doing?"&nbsp; Nina asked.
<p>"Now we're even.&nbsp; We take the same risk.&nbsp; I'll stay naked
until we get to your place and then I'll dress for the trip back to mine.&nbsp;
I have to say I'm pretty...impressed with your...ease, in being naked.&nbsp;
It surprised me at the house, and I never thought you would really strip
down here for IO.&nbsp; But you did and...well...I admire your strength."
<p>Nina didn't know what to say.&nbsp; "Er..."
<p>"It's okay.&nbsp; So...shall we go?&nbsp; A quick run to the car and
we're out of here!"
<p>Nina nodded and a moment later, after peeking into the parking lot,
two nude attractive females made a dash to the car, jumping in like the
'Dukes of Hazzard', before speeding off into the emptying streets.
<p>Only a few cars saw them, the drivers honking their horns and grinning,
which made both girls cringe a little.&nbsp; But they soon relaxed and
even started waving back.
<p>Their hearts didn't slow down though, until they reached the main gate
of the Cook residence, and it seemed forever before the gate opened.&nbsp;
Helen gunned the engine and didn't stop until they pulled up in front of
the house.
<p>Nina was glad to be home and got out of the car as Brian Cook came out
to greet them.&nbsp; He raised his eyebrows at seeing Nina naked, and was
very surprised to see Helen crouched in the driver's seat trying to shield
her own nude body with her arms.
<p>"Dare I ask?" he said, looking from one young woman to the other.
<p>Helen and Nina exchanged a grin.&nbsp; "I'll tell you all about it inside,
Sir," Nina said, and she guided her host indoors so her new friend could
get dressed.
<p>As they went inside, Nina found herself happy about one thing.&nbsp;
Her friend's action had assured her that no one at work would find out
about this incident, and Nina was also glad to have a friend who would
do something like that for her.
<p>In the end, it had not been a bad trip after all!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 7.

<br>
<p>Part 8, The Party.
<p>Nina had been living in the Cook house for a month now.&nbsp; A month
of being always nude at home, of dressing only in the garage at the head
of the driveway, of being seen by the gardeners when they came by once
a week.&nbsp; Nina had even continued to help the housekeeper, Mrs. Terry,
with her weekly grocery run, done of course in the nude.
<p>There were many times where Nina thought she would die of embarrassment,
but she never did, and soon she began to grow used to her almost constant
nudity, broken only when she dressed for work or the occasionally trip
off the property.
<p>It helped a lot that her fears of being found out at work were not realized.&nbsp;
Her new friend Helen didn't breath a word of that first trip to IO, or
of any of the subsequent trips she insisted on coming along on for various
fittings.
<p>Nina had enjoyed her company, and was glad to have a friend along.&nbsp;
She was also very happy with her new clothes, and certainly turned heads
at the firm where she worked; for while completely covering her, the new
suits certainly showed off her figure.
<p>So Nina adjusted, and after a while was really able to call the house
she lived in...home.
<p>Then, one Saturday afternoon, her host Brian Cook told her that he was
having a party that night.
<p>"It will be a large group," he said, "several partners from the firm
will be in attendance, as well as a sampling of our neighbors.&nbsp; I'd
like them all to meet you."
<p>"But I have nothing to wear!" said the naked girl, who suddenly blushed
at the double meaning behind her words.&nbsp; She had meant that she had
nothing formal enough for such a party, but then of course, at that moment
she had nothing at all!
<p>Brian smiled, of course catching both meanings.&nbsp; "That's not a
problem," he said.
<p>Nina looked worried.&nbsp; He had told her at the beginning that there
were going to be events at his home where he would expect her to show up
naked.&nbsp; She had to ask.&nbsp; "Am I...er...supposed to be...?"
<p>Brian chuckled.&nbsp; "No, Nina, not for this group.&nbsp; IO is making
you a formal gown, isn't he?"
<p>"Yes, but it isn't ready yet.&nbsp; I haven't even seen it!"
<p>"Well, I'll call him.&nbsp; I promise that you will have that dress
tonight!"
<p>Nina smiled, and gave Brian a hug.
<p>The old man chuckled, enjoying the feel of the young nude woman against
his tired body.&nbsp; "You're welcome!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was early evening, and guests were already arriving, yet Nina couldn't
see them yet.&nbsp; She was pacing in her room because her dress had yet
to arrive.&nbsp; Trapped because she had nothing else to wear, Nina wondered
if Brian would order her to come down anyway.
<p>What if he did; would she go?&nbsp; Her makeup was done, her hair pinned,
she was ready in every respect except for her clothes.&nbsp; Would she
have the guts to walk downstairs like this in front of all those people?&nbsp;
Nina didn't know.
<p>A knock at the door, and Nina went to open it.&nbsp; She was relieved
to see Mrs. Terry standing there, unusually dressed in a formal maid's
uniform, considering the woman spent more time naked than Nina did.&nbsp;
She looked strange.&nbsp; She also wasn't alone, and Nina was surprised
to see IO himself standing in the hallway.
<p>In reflex, Nina moved to cover herself, even though IO had had his fingers
on more places of her body than even her last boyfriend.&nbsp; Some things
you didn't hide from your tailor.
<p>"Are you going to let us in, Miss West?" Mrs. Terry said.
<p>"Oh...yes, come in."
<p>IO smiled as he entered, carrying a large box that just had to hold
the gown Nina had been expecting.&nbsp; "I bet you've been waiting for
this!" he said, his eyes roaming all over the attractive young lady.
<p>Nina blushed at his attention, but nodded.
<p>"Good.&nbsp; Well, let's get you dressed."
<p>Nina nodded again, eager to put something on, and very eager to see
what unique creation IO had made just for her.&nbsp; She had certainly
been impressed by what he did with her work clothes; his evening gowns
must be spectacular.
<p>The box was opened, and a lot of white paper was pulled out, so much
in fact that Nina almost didn't see the dress as it was carefully lifted
out by IO.
<p>"Here it is!" he said with a smile, and both Nina and Mrs. Terry were
captivated.
<p>The dress was white, silk and gauze, with what looked like diamond bands
crossing at the bust and waist.&nbsp; It shone in the light and looked
light as a feather.
<p>"Well," IO said, happy at the response, "shall we?"
<p>"Oh yes," Nina said, looking down for the underwear she would wear with
the dress.&nbsp; But except for a pair of white heels, there was nothing
else.&nbsp; Nina looked up at IO.
<p>IO chuckled.&nbsp; "You can't wear anything under this dress, but don't
worry about it."
<p>"Don't worry?" Nina said, very concerned.
<p>"Trust me!"
<p>Nina almost said no, but instead she nodded, feeling that whatever covering
the dress gave her was better than being nude.
<p>"Okay, arms up high," IO ordered.&nbsp; "Mrs. Terry, a hand please!"
<p>Mrs. Terry, under IO's direction, helped with the placement of the white
dress on Nina's body, and Nina knew she had never put on a dress this way
before.&nbsp; Instead of her either stepping into it, or having it pulled
over her head, it was actually bent around her from her left side.&nbsp;
Wire stays under and over the bust gripped her chest firmly yet comfortably,
while another held on to her waist.&nbsp; After some adjusting, IO was
happy with the fit, and Nina was able to look in her mirror.
<p>She looked stunning.&nbsp; The shoulderless gown seemed to begin at
her breasts, creating a decent amount of cleavage displayed prominently
in a diamond shaped hole, before curling down to her waist and falling
to the floor.&nbsp; The material was sheer enough that in the light of
her room Nina could almost see her body, but her breasts and groin were
hidden by the diamond like bands that almost wound around her.&nbsp; Nina
also felt some hidden support for her breasts, support that created the
cleavage and also presented her outwards.&nbsp; It was still obvious though
that she wore nothing underneath it, because her right side, a three-inch
band from her armpit to her thigh, was completely bare.&nbsp; Below that,
the dress moved like any high slit dress, exposing and hiding her legs.&nbsp;
The built in stays held the dress to her, hugging her body and bringing
out her curves, and all would know it was the only covering she had.
<p>But its beauty mesmerized Nina; she HAD to wear it, but it also scared
the hell out of her.
<p>"Beautiful," IO said, with Mrs. Terry nodding slowly in agreement.&nbsp;
"But it needs one adjustment."&nbsp; IO stood behind Nina and pulled the
pins from her hair, allowing it to fall and cascade around her shoulders.&nbsp;
It made a difference, a very erotic one.
<p>"I've never seen anything like this," Nina said.
<p>"Not many women could wear a dress like this," IO responded, "but there
is no denying that you can.&nbsp; Come now, I'll take you downstairs."
<p>Nina nodded and obediently took his arm.&nbsp; Gracefully, IO led her
to the party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was now fairly late in the evening, and Nina was tired, for she had
barely had a chance to sit down for hours.&nbsp; It seemed that everyone
that Brian Cook had invited to the party had wanted to meet her, and Nina
had felt quite the center of attention.&nbsp; She had also felt the eyes
of most of the men in the room, some trying to make out the faint shadows
under the material of the dress, almost all examining closely the band
of bare skin that told all she didn't have on any underwear.&nbsp; Nina
also had to take care walking around so she didn't flash the guests.&nbsp;
With her right hip bare, it didn't take much movement for the front of
the dress to swing far enough to one side to expose her.
<p>What got her through the party were the manners of the gentlemen she
talked to, and the presence of her new best friend, Helen, whom Brian had
also invited.
<p>But now the party seemed to be winding down, and after impressing the
firm's partners, who had all gone home by now, Nina was ready for a bit
of a rest.
<p>The group that remained was still rather active.&nbsp; A small group,
but a friendly one at least.&nbsp; There was Helen, of course, and Brian;
and IO had stayed, dressed in a suit of his own creation.&nbsp; Besides
them were several other neighbors, who all lived in various high priced
houses in the immediate area.
<p>The party was in the coffee stage now, and Nina was just going to take
an empty seat when Brian walked slowly to the middle of the lounge they
happened to be gathered in, tapping his cup with a spoon.
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, if you please?" he said, smiling generously.
<p>The group settled and Nina waited to see what her host was up to.&nbsp;
She didn't have to wait long.
<p>"Thank you, thank you all for coming here tonight.&nbsp; I know it has
been longer than usual since we have last been together, but I thought
it wise to take a little time to let my new guest settle in for a bit."&nbsp;
Brian smiled at Nina and the girl blushed a little at the renewed attention.
<p>Helen grinned too, but she was not sure what was going on.&nbsp; Like
Nina, this was her first party at the Cook house.
<p>"But now that you are all here, I would like to reveal to you all what
I have been working on this past month.&nbsp; It's still a work in progress,
but I feel it has come along enough to give you all a peek."
<p>There were murmurs of appreciation and Brian turned to Nina.
<p>For a second, Nina thought he was going to ask her to undress, but he
didn't.&nbsp; Instead he said, "Nina, dear, these folk are all artists
and friends, and we like to show off our work in front of each other."
<p>Nina smiled and nodded, relieved.
<p>Brian turned to the doorway.&nbsp; "Alison!"
<p>The double doors were already open, and a moment later Mrs. Terry appeared,
pushing a low table on wheels.&nbsp; On the table was a cloth colored object
about four feet high, and Nina knew it was the sculpture Brian had been
working on since she got here.&nbsp; She was eager to see it, Brian having
kept it a secret even from her.
<p>But that wasn't the first thought in her mind, and she was only slightly
aware of Helen gasping next to her.&nbsp; What caught Nina's attention
was that while the sculpture was covered, the housekeeper wasn't.&nbsp;
Mrs. Terry had reverted back to her nudist status, and seemed quite unconcerned
about appearing before this group naked.
<p>Nina looked around, watching for signs of surprise, but apart from Helen,
who looked like she was about to start laughing, no one else even seemed
to notice.&nbsp; It was as if seeing the nude housekeeper was old news
to them.
<p>That made Nina think.
<p>Brian glanced at Nina with an amused expression and then nodded at Mrs.
Terry.&nbsp; The housekeeper with little flourish pulled the cloth from
the sculpture, and everyone in the room made an appreciative noise.
<p>Nina was too distracted to notice at first; it took Helen to bring her
to Earth.&nbsp; "Nina, is that you?"
<p>Nina stared at the statue and realized with a start that the figure
in stone WAS her.&nbsp; It certainly wasn't finished, but the head carried
her features and her body down to her waist had been carefully carved out
of the stone.&nbsp; Her nude body, that is.&nbsp; Nina's image seemed to
be caught in a moment of indecision, one arm raised as if to cover her
naked breasts but not quite getting there.&nbsp; The other disappeared
into the uncut stone below the figure's waist.&nbsp; The expression on
the face of the statue was one of insecurity and embarrassment, something
Nina had felt a lot over the past month.&nbsp; Nina began to blush.
<p>"It's a fine start," was the general consensus, and people moved to
examine the statue more closely.&nbsp; Some looked from Nina to the statue
and back again, making Nina blush further.
<p>"So you really DO model for him," Helen whispered with a giggle, "but
you didn't say you did it nude!"
<p>"Well, I..." Nina began, but one of the guests, who had been talking
composition with Brian, suddenly spoke out loud.
<p>"What we need, Brian, is a comparison.&nbsp; Is it possible to see your
model against the statue?"
<p>Brian smiled.&nbsp; "Of course!&nbsp; Nina, if you would please?"
<p>Startled, Nina moved closer to the statue, but the guest shook his head.&nbsp;
"You look lovely in that dress, Sweetheart, but the statue hasn't got one
on.&nbsp; Do you mind?"
<p>Nina realized that she was expected to strip, and she looked at Brian
for help.&nbsp; Instead of help though, he said, "Nina, this is one of
those groups I mentioned to you.&nbsp; You are quite safe reverting to
our agreement now.&nbsp; So I would like you to remove that delightful
dress."
<p>"What?" Nina said, stunned.&nbsp; Beside her, Helen began coughing up
her drink, very surprised herself.
<p>"Remove the dress now, Nina.&nbsp; It's quite alright."
<p>This was it; the moment Nina had been dreading for a month.&nbsp; He
was finally asking her to get naked in front of a crowd, even though the
crowd was only a dozen strong.&nbsp; Nina didn't know if she had the strength,
but unfortunately IO came to her aid.
<p>"I'll help her off with the dress, I don't want it ruined," he said.
<p>Too stunned to speak, Nina numbly allowed the tailor to bend the stays
that had gripped her all night, and reveal her body to all.
<p>"Exquisite," said one of the women immediately.&nbsp; "Brian, how do
you get so lucky with all your models?"
<p>Another said, "Damn good musculature; do you work out girl?"
<p>Another voice said, "Yes, I can see now why you chose that slope to
the breasts; unsupported they do fall into that position.&nbsp; But then,
Old Man, you always had a good eye for female anatomy."
<p>More voices added their praise and/or criticism, and for several minutes
Nina stood and allowed herself to be visually dissected.&nbsp; It was only
then that she realized that none of the comments she heard was aimed at
degrading or sexually exploiting her.&nbsp; All seemed to reference the
statue or art in general.&nbsp; There were even a couple of offers for
her to come model.
<p>Brian stepped close to her and whispered in her ear.&nbsp; "I told you
these people would be more interested in your body for its artistic value
than anything else.&nbsp; Surprised?"
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, I am."
<p>"You have to learn to trust me more," Brian replied, and he began to
move away.
<p>"Brian," Nina said, still trying to deal with the shock of the moment.
<p>"Yes, dear?"
<p>"Are you...done with me tonight?&nbsp; I'd like to go up to my room
now."
<p>"Of course, I understand.&nbsp; Go right ahead."
<p>Nina nodded again and said her goodnights.&nbsp; She hesitated in front
of IO, who looked at her with anything but an artist's eye, and as she
left, she didn't even notice that Helen was no longer in the room.
<p>Naked, she padded up the stairs to the top floor, paused at her own
door, and then continued up the spiral staircase to the sunroom.
<p>It was night now, and the room was lit only by the stars and reflected
light from the few streetlights that dotted the neighborhood.&nbsp; Nina
crossed over to one of the couches and collapsed on it, releasing the tension
of the moment in a few heartfelt sobs.&nbsp; She didn't know what to think
about what had happened downstairs, whether to feel humiliated or not.&nbsp;
Nina was very confused.
<p>She didn't know anyone was in the room with her until she felt a hand
on her shoulder.&nbsp; She jumped and screamed.&nbsp; Startled, Helen jumped
back and screamed too.
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" Helen said, "I'm sorry.&nbsp; I didn't mean to scare
you."&nbsp; Helen had stepped out into the entryway to compose herself,
and Nina had walked right by her without seeing her.&nbsp; Helen wondered
what really was happening in this house, and decided to follow her friend.
<p>"I didn't know it was you, Helen," Nina said, unconsciously trying to
hide her body, even though Helen had seen her naked several times.&nbsp;
But the events of the evening had heightened her sensitivity a little.
<p>"It's okay, I should have knocked.&nbsp; Are you okay?"
<p>Nina paused, and shook her head.
<p>Now Helen was truly concerned.&nbsp; "What happened downstairs, is that...normal?"
<p>"I guess it is now!" Nina replied.
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>Nina slowly began to explain the strange deal she had made to live in
this house, how in return for food and lodging she was to remain naked
at all times while on the property.
<p>Helen was amazed, never having heard such a thing in her life.&nbsp;
"I had no idea Brian Cook was into that!" she said.
<p>"Oh no," Nina replied, "It's nothing sordid.&nbsp; I am actually modeling
for Brian, but what he is looking for in his art is something that can
only be captured in candid moments.&nbsp; You saw the statue, surely you
see that!"
<p>Helen did see.&nbsp; The four-foot figure of Nina certainly looked like
she wanted to be anything but naked, something a professional model would
be hard put to fake.
<p>"Did you know he was going to expose you in front of all those people?"
Helen asked her.
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "He warned me, told me it was going to happen sometimes,
but the reality of it all was a bit overwhelming.&nbsp; But I'm glad you're
here, I need a friend right now."
<p>Helen smiled and the two women, one dressed in a formal gown, the other
completely naked, hugged.
<p>Helen was also glad to be there, and knew being friends with Nina could
prove very interesting indeed.
<p>Helen smiled.

<p>Part 9, Buffalo Beach.
<p>Nina West picked up another stack of files and carried them carefully
to the desk she had been working at for the last three days.&nbsp; No longer
in the plush paralegal's office which she shared with three other co workers,
Nina had been down in the basement doing estate research for one of the
firm's many lawyers.&nbsp; Paging through every file in the firm's large
Real Estate section of cases had been dull but necessary, and the small
book of notes she had put together concerning the concealed actions of
one of their former clients was going to help the firm immensely.&nbsp;
Nina felt proud of her work, and glanced at the last pile happily.
<p>She had been told that if she finished this task in four days, she could
have a three-day weekend.&nbsp; Nina had managed in just three.
<p>Her haste had come at a price, though; it had meant burying herself
in her work at the expense of the new friendships she had been trying to
build with her work mates, especially Helen who had been so nice to her
the night of the party.
<p>Nina hadn't see her friend since that night but thought of her occasionally,
or more accurately, thought of how in a moment of weakness she had told
Helen about her arrangement with her host, Brian Cook.
<p>To her credit, Helen hadn't acted shocked, and had stayed for a little
while to comfort Nina who had just been through a rather shocking experience
herself.&nbsp; She had been asked, more like forced, to undress in a room
of complete strangers.
<p>But Helen left soon after, and there had been no calls, no sign of her
since then.&nbsp; Nina wondered if she had lost a friend.
<p>But right now, she couldn't dwell on it.&nbsp; There was still work
to be done.
<p>Nina sat at the desk, inhaling sharply as the cold, hard chair support
touched her back.&nbsp; Nina had taken her jacket off; the files and the
room in general were dusty, and she didn't want to ruin it.&nbsp; But that
left her in just her silk blouse, a blouse so light and thin that only
by looking down could Nina remember she was wearing it.&nbsp; The material
was also so sheer that all her bras showed clearly through it, so she was
forced to go without.&nbsp; With her jacket on that hadn't been a problem,
but without it, Nina felt naked, despite the fact that the pattern in the
silk concealed the more obvious signs of her condition, her nipples.&nbsp;
Walking around Nina could only barely feel that her breasts were covered,
and was sure others noticed too.
<p>In actual fact, many people did, despite the jacket, but none drew attention
to it because they enjoyed seeing the young woman like that.&nbsp; Besides,
it was her choice, wasn't it?&nbsp; No one had forced the girl to dress
like that.&nbsp; And as long as the clients didn't complain, the firm tolerated
it.
<p>Nina was sitting at her desk, leaning forward over a file, when she
heard the door to the basement storage room open.&nbsp; Out of habit Nina
clenched her elbows to her sides in an attempt to hide what she felt were
her obviously hanging breasts.&nbsp; She looked up, and when she saw who
it was, she smiled.&nbsp; It was Helen.
<p>"Hi," she said, sitting back.
<p>"Hi, Nina," Helen replied.&nbsp; Helen glanced back at the corridor
for a second, and then stepped into the room, closing the door behind her.&nbsp;
She was smiling, but appeared a little nervous to Nina.&nbsp; Nina also
saw Helen's eyes flick briefly over her body, and Nina flushed, remembering
that the last time they had been together, Nina had been nude.&nbsp; To
cover up her embarrassment, Nina spoke.
<p>"So what brings you down here?" she said.
<p>"You," Helen replied.&nbsp; "I'm on a break and...well...I thought you
could use a little company.&nbsp; I've done my time down here myself, so
I know how lonely it can get."
<p>"It's pretty quiet," Nina agreed.
<p>"I've been meaning to come down before, but it's been pretty busy up
there without you," Helen said with a little laugh.
<p>Nina laughed too, and the couple became still.
<p>Helen stood, nervous, while Nina sat, feeling the same way.&nbsp; Both
had the same thing on their mind, and didn't know how to talk about it.
<p>"Helen," Nina said eventually, "I want to apologize for the party, for
what happened...to me."
<p>"It's okay, you didn't do anything," Helen was quick to reply.
<p>"It's not okay.&nbsp; I got you involved in something private, something
I'm not that comfortable with at times."
<p>"Your deal with Brian Cook?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>Helen moved from the door and walked over to her friend.&nbsp; "I have
to say that I was shocked when you told me about it.&nbsp; I mean, that
day I first came over, you weren't swimming naked just for the exercise,
were you?&nbsp; It was because you had no choice but to BE naked."
<p>"Oh, I have a choice," Nina said, looking up.&nbsp; "I'm not forced
into anything.&nbsp; But if I break my lease by putting clothes on, then
I lose a lot."
<p>"Do you really want to live like that?" Helen asked, very curious about
her friend's lifestyle.
<p>Nina sat quietly for a moment before answering.&nbsp; "Let's not talk
about it right now."
<p>Helen took a breath, letting it out slowly.&nbsp; "Okay, I should be
heading back anyway.&nbsp; Maybe we can do something later."
<p>"Yes, let's do something.&nbsp; In fact...there is something I haven't
done yet that I would like to," Nina said.
<p>"What's that?" Helen asked.
<p>"Go to the beach.&nbsp; I've been here a month and I haven't set foot
on it yet.&nbsp; I didn't want to go alone."
<p>Helen nodded.&nbsp; "Sure, I'll come by after work and we can get something
to eat out there."
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "That would be great.&nbsp; See you later then."
<p>Helen smiled and left the room.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina did get to leave early that day, an ecstatic boss giving her the
three day weekend he had promised, and she drove home filled with pride
at a job well done.&nbsp; It was still only mid-afternoon, so Nina took
a longer way home, driving past the long public beach she knew she would
soon be visiting.&nbsp; It looked so inviting, barely a soul on it except
for a few families here and there, and the ocean beyond looked heavenly.
<p>Nina sighed and headed for home.
<p>Once there, Nina undressed as was her custom in the privacy of the garage,
and made her way quickly up the driveway to the house.&nbsp; She had hung
her clothes on hangers outside the room the rest of her wardrobe was kept
in, but to gain access to a swimsuit she needed to talk to Brian.
<p>"He's in his studio, Miss West," Alison Terry, the housekeeper told
her.
<p>"Oh no, when is he coming out?" Nina asked.&nbsp; Both women were in
the kitchen, Mrs. Terry standing at a counter rolling out some pastry with
a roller.&nbsp; Nina watched from her perch near the door, still surprised
after a month that the older woman did all these chores in the nude.&nbsp;
Nina could never quite get over the sight of Mrs. Terry baking with no
clothes on, her front as it was now, sprinkled with flour and other minor
stains.&nbsp; Only rarely did the housekeeper wear an apron, usually only
when she handled something hot.
<p>"He didn't say, Miss West.&nbsp; Only that he said not to wait supper
on him."
<p>"Dammit.&nbsp; I needed to see him."
<p>Mrs. Terry turned, her dour face decorated with a raised eyebrow.&nbsp;
"Is there anything I can help you with?"
<p>"Well, I'm going out with Helen tonight, just a trip to the beach, and
I needed to get a swimsuit out."
<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Terry, and she turned back to her baking.
<p>"Would he really mind if I knocked on his door?"
<p>"For something as simple as that he would," the housekeeper answered.
<p>"Well, could you let me in to get a suit?"
<p>"It's not my place, Miss.&nbsp; That's a decision for Mr. Cook."
<p>"Well, that's just great; I can't go to the beach naked!"
<p>Mrs. Terry inclined her head at that remark, but didn't say anything.
<p>"I'll just have to tell Helen the trip is off.&nbsp; We'll have to do
something here," continued Nina.&nbsp; It was only after she said it that
Nina realized she was contemplating spending time with her friend here,
in the nude.&nbsp; Was she that desperate for company?
<p>"Well," said Mrs. Terry, "Why not wait until your friend gets here,
before making any alternate plans.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr. Cook will have appeared
by then."
<p>Nina wasn't optimistic.&nbsp; Her host had sometimes locked himself
away with his sculpturing until late at night.
<p>"Maybe," said the naked young woman, and she turned and went to her
room.
<p>Mrs. Terry smiled.
<p>---***---
<p>When Helen drove up to the house three hours later, she had mentally
prepared herself to see Nina nude once more, but had completely forgotten
about Mrs. Terry.&nbsp; She was therefore a little stunned when the naked
housekeeper opened the door.
<p>"Hello, Miss Helen.&nbsp; Miss West is in the kitchen."
<p>"Er...thanks," said Helen.
<p>Mrs. Terry led the way, and Helen found Nina seated at the kitchen table
with a glass of milk at her elbow, her attention in the book in front of
her.&nbsp; She was leaning forward, her ankles crossed under the chair,
and Helen was surprised at how casual she looked.
<p>"Hi," she said.
<p>Nina jumped and looked at her friend, and Helen noticed Nina close in
a bit, shielding her nude body a little but trying not to be obvious about
it.
<p>"Hi, you look nice," Nina said, meaning it.
<p>Helen had run home to change before coming over.&nbsp; Prepared for
the beach, she had on a dark blue bikini, rather modestly cut, flip flops,
and a very short beach wrap.&nbsp; She felt rather underdressed, but as
she was going to the beach, that was okay.&nbsp; It was not as if she was
driving around naked.&nbsp; Helen still thought about that mad trip with
Nina a few weeks before.
<p>"Thanks.&nbsp; So, are you ready?" Helen said with a grin.
<p>Helen expected Nina to smile at least, but instead the young woman shook
her head.&nbsp; "We can't go."
<p>"Why not?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina blushed.&nbsp; "I don't have anything to wear."
<p>"Well, that's pretty obvious from where I'm standing, Sweety," Helen
said with a smirk, relaxing at last, "But surely you have a swimsuit someplace."
<p>"I do, but they're all locked away."
<p>"Locked away?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "I told you, I gave up control over my clothes; and
a part of that is having them locked away.&nbsp; Only Brian can let me
at them."
<p>"Where is he?"
<p>Nina told Helen about Brian and his 'do not disturb' policy when he
was working.
<p>Helen wasn't worried.&nbsp; "Well, that's okay; I can run and buy you
a suit, you'll be fine."
<p>Nina perked up; that option hadn't occurred to her.&nbsp; But Mrs. Terry,
working across the room, put that notion to rest.
<p>"Mr. Cook wouldn't care for that, Miss West," the housekeeper said.&nbsp;
"It says in your contract he has control over all your clothes; that includes
any you purchase or borrow."
<p>"How do you know he'll care?" Helen asked, wondering why the woman was
also naked.
<p>"Because I've already been down that road with Mr. Cook.&nbsp; It was
in my own contract."
<p>Both young women stared at Mrs. Terry for a moment, and while the older
woman didn't turn to face them, they could still see that she was blushing
a little.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "Well, I guess we stay here tonight.&nbsp; You'll
stay for dinner, won't you, Helen?"
<p>"Sure.&nbsp; I don't mind.&nbsp; We can go another time."
<p>"There is another solution," said Mrs. Terry, now turning to face the
two younger women.
<p>"What is it?" Nina asked.
<p>"Buffalo beach!"
<p>---***---
<p>"I can't believe I'm doing this," Nina said, trying to relax as they
sped down the coastal highway.&nbsp; They were eight miles out of town
and still had another twenty to go, and Nina knew for sure she had never
been this far away from her clothing before.&nbsp; Naked, she sat in the
passenger seat of her friend's car, slouched down as best she could so
oncoming traffic couldn't see her.&nbsp; Unlike the nighttime drives she
had taken, there was no disguising her nude state in full daylight.
<p>Nina looked over at Helen, envious of the other woman's brief attire,
and said again, "I can't believe..."
<p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah.&nbsp; I get the idea," yelled Helen into the wind
of her convertible.&nbsp; "But you were the one who decided to come!"
<p>"I was nuts.&nbsp; Turn around!"
<p>Helen laughed.&nbsp; "Are you sure you don't want my wrap?"
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; Helen's wrap wasn't long enough to cover Nina's bottom,
and it wasn't opaque enough to cover anything else.&nbsp; "I'd rather have
your suit."
<p>"No way, girlfriend.&nbsp; You made your deal; you live by it.&nbsp;
We could still pick up a suit for you; no one would be the wiser."
<p>It was true; she could do it, they could dump the suit afterwards, and
Brian would never know.&nbsp; But Nina had been brought up with a respect
for promises she had made, and her unusual lease was such a promise.&nbsp;
She knew that she would do her best to honor it.
<p>"No," she said slowly, "I'm fine."
<p>Helen nodded and kept driving, amazed at her friend's strength.&nbsp;
No way would she have allowed herself to be driven miles out into the country
with no clothes on, and she admired Nina for her determination.&nbsp; She
also had to admit to herself more than a little excitement at being around
her naked friend.&nbsp; Certainly since meeting her, Helen found her own
life a little more exciting.&nbsp; Helen shared an apartment and a lease
with three other young professional women, and peace in this household
was only achieved when all were at work.&nbsp; She liked her roommates,
but still yearned for the spacious apartment she lived in back home.&nbsp;
The place she had before by herself was twice as big as the apartment she
shared now, and one fourth the cost.
<p>In a way, Helen envied the deal Nina had made, and she wondered how
she would react given the same chance.
<p>Probably not as well.
<p>Twenty minutes later, they turned off the highway in the direction of
the ocean.&nbsp; They navigated a narrow gravel road, one they found only
because it had a metal silhouette of a buffalo on a post at its head.&nbsp;
The road wound around a few hills, traveling well out of sight of the highway
until it ended in a sandy parking lot.&nbsp; There were several cars there,
but it didn't look too crowded.
<p>Helen shut the engine off after parking, and the two women sat and listened
to the sudden silence.
<p>"Well?" Helen asked.
<p>"What do you know about this place, Helen?&nbsp; You must have heard
of it."
<p>"No, I haven't.&nbsp; I have heard of Buffalo Hills, the nudist resort
about three miles east of here, but not the beach," Helen replied.
<p>Nina looked around.&nbsp; "Do you really think this beach is a nude
one?"
<p>"I don't know.&nbsp; Would Mrs. Terry lie to you about something like
this?"
<p>Nina thought about that.&nbsp; "No, I don't think she would.&nbsp; But
the only way to find out is to go out there.&nbsp; Come on."
<p>Nina opened her door and stepped out.&nbsp; It was one of the hardest
things she had ever done, yet once out it felt easy.&nbsp; She was already
used to the warm sun shining on her bare skin, and the feel of the sand
under her feet was really good.&nbsp; What was new was the ocean breeze
caressing her skin, and the strong smell of the sea.&nbsp; She could hear
the roar of the waves, but couldn't see the beach.
<p>Helen got out the other side, still in her bikini and wrap.&nbsp; She
left her shoes in the car, but grabbed a small pack and a beach towel.
<p>Nina raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "You had a towel?"
<p>Helen shrugged, an apologetic look on her face.&nbsp; "Forgot."
<p>Nina chuckled, feeling more at ease the longer she stood there, wondering
if her friend was telling the truth.&nbsp; But it didn't really matter.
<p>"I'm sorry, I only brought the one, I didn't know you didn't have any,"
Helen said, walking around the car.
<p>"That's okay.&nbsp; Come on, let's go."
<p>The two women walked across the sand lot to what looked like a sign
on the ocean side, beyond which a path led down what was obviously a cliff.&nbsp;
What it said confirmed Mrs. Terry's tale.
<p>BUFFALO BEACH.
<p>This beach has been designated as a private nudist facility for members
and their guests only.&nbsp; All others will be encouraged to leave, with
incentives up to and including full prosecution for trespassing!
<p>All visitors are STRONGLY encouraged to leave all clothing in their
vehicles, or else face the wrath of the BEARD!
<p>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
<p>Below this was a set of rules, the same as you would find at any beach,
with the inclusion that camera equipment was forbidden.
<p>"The wrath of the Beard?&nbsp; What's that?" Nina asked.
<p>Helen didn't answer, she was looking rather pale.
<p>"What's wrong?" Nina asked.
<p>"I don't think I'll be wanted down there," she said, glancing down at
her swimsuit.
<p>"You could always take it off," suggested Nina.&nbsp; "I mean...it really
meant a lot to me that time we had to drive home naked together.&nbsp;
It didn't make me feel so much alone."
<p>"I know.&nbsp; Look, I'm sorry, I can't.&nbsp; Not this time.&nbsp;
Okay?"
<p>Nina nodded, disappointed.&nbsp; "Okay.&nbsp; I bet you'll be all right
anyway.&nbsp; What can they do, ask us to leave?"
<p>Helen shrugged.&nbsp; "Well, if you're sure you want to do this, lets
go."
<p>Nina led the way, and the couple walked the path, descending to the
beach below.&nbsp; It wasn't until they got almost to the bottom that they
saw the beach itself, with a few dozen people sunning, swimming, or playing
in the sand.
<p>Nina and Helen both noticed that everyone there was nude, but both had
different reactions.&nbsp; Nina felt a little relieved, the reality of
it all calming her.&nbsp; She knew that she would still be exposing herself
to strangers again, but at least she would get as good as she gave.&nbsp;
Rather than stand out, she would be one of the crowd.&nbsp; Helen on the
other hand looked about in vain for someone like herself in a swimsuit.&nbsp;
But the expanse of tanned skin showed her that she was alone in being covered
up, and that made her more nervous.
<p>They reached the bottom and walked out onto the beach proper.&nbsp;
The sand was hot but soft, and the sight of the ocean so close drove Nina
wild with excitement.&nbsp; The Midwestern girl had little contact with
the ocean in her life, and was hungry for it.&nbsp; But she was also very
conscious of the others on the beach, her eyes drawn to them, the men in
particular.&nbsp; She held her arms across her breasts in an unconscious
action.&nbsp; She didn't notice Helen slowing down behind her, nor the
friendly looking woman coming the other way.
<p>"Hi, can I help you?" asked the woman.
<p>Helen and Nina turned to see a fit looking older woman smiling at them.&nbsp;
She had a compact body, and her deep tan showed clearly that she spent
a lot of time outside with nothing on.&nbsp; She smiled at Nina and looked
rather uncertainly at Helen.
<p>"Hello, my name is Nina West," said Nina, holding out a hand.
<p>The woman took it.&nbsp; "Gabby Jackson."
<p>"This is my friend, Helen," Nina continued.
<p>Gabby politely shook hands, then turned back to Nina.&nbsp; "Did you
see the sign up on the cliff?&nbsp; This is a private beach.&nbsp; So I
hope you understand when I ask who sent you?"
<p>"Alison Terry sent us," Nina said.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry had told them to
give whoever asked her name.
<p>"Oh Alison.&nbsp; OH, you must be THAT Nina.&nbsp; You're staying with
Brian Cook, right?"
<p>'THAT Nina' Nina thought.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; I guess you've heard about
me."
<p>"Alison mentioned you, as did Beard.&nbsp; I'm happy to have you here...and
your friend."&nbsp; Gabby glanced at Helen as if the other woman had two
heads.
<p>Nina noticed this, and Helen's discomfort.&nbsp; "Er, Gabby.&nbsp; Is
it okay if Helen stays in her suit?&nbsp; She...er..."
<p>Gabby smiled.&nbsp; "Of course.&nbsp; We don't FORCE anyone to undress
down here.&nbsp; But she might feel better if she did."&nbsp; Gabby turned
to Helen and smiled a stiff smile.
<p>"Maybe later," was all Helen could think to say.
<p>Nina suddenly wondered something.&nbsp; "Who is Beard?"
<p>Gabby laughed.&nbsp; "I'm sure you'll recognize him when you see him.&nbsp;
In fact, I know he will want to say hi.&nbsp; You can find him around the
headland on the right.&nbsp; You should go over before you leave."
<p>"Sure, thanks," Nina replied, and Gabby moved off.
<p>"What a bitch," Helen whispered, making Nina giggle.
<p>"I don't think she liked your outfit," Nina replied.
<p>"Screw her," Helen said, still feeling out of place.
<p>Nina saw how uncomfortable her friend was, and wished she hadn't decided
to take the plunge and come out here.&nbsp; But now that she was here,
Nina wanted to make the most of it.
<p>"Come on, put your stuff down, and let's go for a swim."
<p>Helen hesitated, then nodded.&nbsp; They found a spot for the towel
and bag, and Helen dropped her wrap.&nbsp; Then the two friends headed
for the ocean.
<p>This was not a surfing beach by any means, the waves rolling gently
onto the shore, but that made it all the more special to Nina, who was
in her element.&nbsp; She swam hard and far, letting the wave action carry
her back to shore.&nbsp; She dove and rose, moving like a fish through
the clear water.
<p>Helen watched her for a bit, then began to relax.&nbsp; Soon the couple
was chasing each other, trading tags and generally having a good time.&nbsp;
One clothed, one not, they behaved as any other swimmers might.
<p>Soon they grew tired though, and Nina led Helen back up the beach to
Helen's things.&nbsp; It occurred to Nina while Helen dried her hair, that
she had brought absolutely nothing with her.&nbsp; Not only didn't Nina
have any clothes, but also she had no jewelry, no ID, absolutely nothing.&nbsp;
She was like a newborn, with nothing to her name, and unable to do a thing
about it.
<p>For Nina, that was quite humbling, and it made her well aware that she
was dependent on others to see her safely home.&nbsp; Thirty miles away
from any of your belongings was not the place to make trouble.&nbsp; Watching
Helen, Nina knew that at least her friend didn't have to worry about getting
home.
<p>"Here," Helen said, handing over her towel.&nbsp; Nina smiled and took
it, drying her own hair.&nbsp; Surprisingly, she found her attempt a little
clumsy, since she was now used to the hot air dryer at home.
<p>Helen watched her friend comfortably standing there naked as she worked
on her hair.&nbsp; Nina looked to her to have no worries at all.&nbsp;
She was obviously perfectly at ease with her nudity now.&nbsp; Helen wished
she could feel as secure.&nbsp; A part of her felt that she should do what
peer pressure was trying to make her do, take off her swimsuit.&nbsp; But
a large part of her was mortified.&nbsp; She lacked the courage she needed,
the courage Nina had in spades from the look of things.
<p>Nina dropped the towel.&nbsp; "Let's go for a walk; I want to see who
this Beard guy is."
<p>"What if he doesn't like what I'm wearing?&nbsp; The sign said beware
his wrath!"
<p>"Don't worry about it.&nbsp; It's probably there to scare the tourists."&nbsp;
Nina held out her hand and the couple began the long walk.
<p>Buffalo Beach was bigger than Helen expected, and she wondered who owned
it.&nbsp; As she walked, she thought about that, keeping her eyes off most
of the men that cavorted around them in the all together.
<p>They rounded a large section of rocks and were surprised to see a brightly
colored canopy set up in a little cove.
<p>Under the canopy were several people, all nude of course.
<p>One man stood looking at a young woman reclined on the sand.&nbsp; In
his hand was a sketch book in which he was furiously drawing.&nbsp; He
rounded the far side of the girl and spied Nina and Helen watching from
the edge of the group.
<p>"I do believe that's Nina I see smiling at me!" he yelled, pointing
directly at her.
<p>Everybody turned, and Nina immediately blushed, aware that a dozen people
were now staring at her naked body.
<p>"Hi," she said softly.&nbsp; Then she recognized the artist as one of
the men at the party a few nights ago.
<p>"Hello, Nina.&nbsp; I don't know if you remember me.&nbsp; We met at
Brian's party.&nbsp; I'm Boris Berednov, but my friends here call me Beard!"
said the man with a light Russian accent.
<p>Nina couldn't see why, the man was clean-shaven.&nbsp; Then she looked
down and realized with a blush that she had the answer.
<p>Beard chuckled and walked around to meet her, the rest of the group
breaking up.&nbsp; "It's good to see you again.&nbsp; Are you here to model
for me?"
<p>"I...er...no.&nbsp; I just came to swim," Nina said.
<p>"Well I insist that you model, just for one sketch.&nbsp; I want to
capture that beauty.&nbsp; You and your...friend."&nbsp; Beard's eyes locked
on Helen for a moment, and he sighed.&nbsp; "That will not do!"
<p>Helen looked about nervously at the group.&nbsp; "What won't?" she said.
<p>Beard gave her a good look.&nbsp; "Such a lovely lady, yet she hides
herself.&nbsp; I expect better from a friend of yours, Nina."
<p>"She can wear a suit if she wants to!" Nina said in Helen's defense.
<p>"Certainly, but why would she want to here?&nbsp; In this place, we
are free.&nbsp; Not shackled to textile mores and values!&nbsp; Come now...er...Helen,
I met you too at Nina's party.&nbsp; Come, join us.&nbsp; I will draw you
and you shall see how beautiful you are."
<p>"I can't," Helen said, looking around nervously.
<p>"Why not?&nbsp; You have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing that we haven't
seen.&nbsp; You should be proud, like your friend here, to be free!"
<p>Helen glanced at the assembled group and blushed.&nbsp; She didn't want
to be the center of attention.
<p>Beard paused, and moved closer.&nbsp; "Tell me, Helen, have you not
been free before?"
<p>Nina stood, watching her friend, remembering the "wrath of Beard" and
wondering if this were it.&nbsp; She saw Helen shake her head, her eyes
down.
<p>"Ah.&nbsp; It is fine," Beard said.&nbsp; He turned and clapped his
hands, getting everyone's attention.&nbsp; "Go!" he yelled.&nbsp; "I must
work!"
<p>People smiled and chatted and began to leave.&nbsp; Startled, Helen
and Nina began to move too, but Beard asked them to stay.&nbsp; Soon they
were the only ones on this side of the rocks.&nbsp; They were alone under
the canopy.
<p>"No one will come now, until you leave," Beard said to the two of them.&nbsp;
He walked back to where several crates were stacked among some pillows
and stuff, and dug around for a minute before bringing back three bottles
of soda.&nbsp; He handed the ladies one each and drank from his own.
<p>Nina and Helen were both thirsty, so they drank too, and the threesome
spent a quiet few minutes simply sipping in silence.
<p>"You feel better?" Beard asked Helen.
<p>"Yes, thanks," said the young woman.&nbsp; "I'm sorry I couldn't...well,
you know."
<p>"I don't give up so easily, young Helen," said Beard.&nbsp; "We are
now alone, and I am determined to draw you, today!&nbsp; Your friend, as
lovely as she is, I can draw another day.&nbsp; But for you; your day is
today, your time is now.&nbsp; Are you going to disappoint me?"
<p>"I really can't," Helen said, shaking her head.&nbsp; She looked at
Nina for support and Nina smiled.
<p>"Helen, it isn't that bad," Nina said, not believing what she was saying.&nbsp;
Only a month ago she would have been the one mortified at the prospect
of standing on a beach naked.&nbsp; Now here she was encouraging someone
else to try it.
<p>Beard moved close to Helen.&nbsp; "It is a good thing to be free.&nbsp;
I know.&nbsp; You can do this.&nbsp; It is within you to do this."
<p>Helen stood silent, not wanting to go on, yet not running either.
<p>"You wish some help?" Beard said, and he reached around for the clasp
that held Helen's top together.
<p>Nina moved to stop him but one look from Beard stopped her.&nbsp; She
saw he was just like IO, very confident in what he was doing and very much
in control.&nbsp; Nina didn't have the courage to stop him.
<p>Neither did Helen, apparently.&nbsp; She stood silent and unmoving as
Beard removed her bikini top, exposing the young woman's breasts to the
sea air, her nipples hardening.&nbsp; Her body now showed a tan line, matching
the area of the recently removed top.
<p>Beard smiled and moved away.&nbsp; "Do you not feel better now, Helen?&nbsp;
More free?"
<p>Helen half shielded her breasts, but not completely.&nbsp; She was experiencing
the airflow across her sensitive nipples for the first time, and was surprised
at how good it felt.&nbsp; She looked once more at Nina, and her friend
smiled in encouragement.
<p>"See," Nina said, "It's okay."
<p>Helen smiled.&nbsp; It was a little strained, but it was there.
<p>Beard had pulled another crate from the back and set it up under the
canopy.&nbsp; "Sit!" he ordered, and Helen moved across the sand, now dressed
in just her bikini bottoms.
<p>She sat, and Nina watched as Beard positioned her just so, her legs
to one side, together and bent at the knees, her arms in her lap, her breasts
half hidden by her hair.
<p>Helen felt that she would bolt at any time, but Beard was professional
and patient with her, and as she was posed, she began to relax a little.&nbsp;
She was still very aware that she was topless, but it didn't seem to be
as big a fear as it was a little bit ago.
<p>Beard eventually smiled and picked up his pad, and in only a few minutes
he had dashed of a series of sketches from different angles.
<p>"You are beautiful, Helen, like your friend there.&nbsp; You should
be proud.&nbsp; Are you proud?"
<p>Helen didn't answer.
<p>"Helen, speak to me.&nbsp; Are you proud?" demanded Beard.
<p>"Yes," Helen said quietly.
<p>Beard smiled.&nbsp; "Next time, you will yell it from the rocks.&nbsp;
There, done."
<p>Beard let her see one of the sketches and Helen was delighted.&nbsp;
It caught her fear in her eyes, but it also showed her pride and beauty
in her body language.&nbsp; To Helen's further delight, it also didn't
exploit her nudity; just hinting at the fact she was topless by showing
an angle that allowed her hair to conceal her.
<p>"I will keep this, beautiful Helen," Beard said, "and will have it delivered
to Nina later.&nbsp; You go now, enjoy the beach and your new freedom.&nbsp;
Go!"
<p>The girls thanked Beard and walked hand in hand back to the beach proper,
Helen all the time shaking from the delayed adrenaline rush.&nbsp; It was
only when they were halfway back to Helen's stuff that they realized that
Beard still had Helen's bikini top.&nbsp; For a moment Helen thought about
going back to get it.&nbsp; But looking around, she decided to stay as
she was.&nbsp; She wasn't ready to strip down completely...yet, but being
topless was a start, wasn't it?
<p>Nina was proud of her friend, well remembering her first time nude in
front of a stranger, and the young women chatted about Nina's experiences
as they sat on Helen's towel.
<p>It turned out to be a great evening, and when it was over, Nina got
to wear the wrap on the drive home.&nbsp; Helen got the towel.

<br>
<p>Part 10, Something Familiar.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina West, paralegal at the firm founded in partnership by her deceased
grandfather, was once again working in the basement.&nbsp; Unlike her previous
task, this time she wasn't stuck there.&nbsp; This project involved all
four of her fellow paralegals.&nbsp; Nina, being the new girl, was given
the task of hauling needed files back and forth from the basement storage
rooms.
<p>Nina was dressed in one of her IO designed business suits, and looked
both smart and very feminine in the well-tailored outfit.&nbsp; This one
was blue, which complemented her eyes.&nbsp; For a change, the blouse was
dark enough so a bra couldn't be seen through it.&nbsp; The added support
was very welcome to the young woman, for most of her time was spent not
only without a bra on, but also without any clothes at all.&nbsp; Really,
the way her life had been going over the last month or so, the only time
she got to wear clothes was while at work.&nbsp; Support for her breasts
was a welcome change.
<p>She was hardly thinking about that now, though; her mind was elsewhere
as she carried a large stack of files to the storage room.&nbsp; In fact,
her mind was on one of her workmates, a guy with the unlikely name of Byron.&nbsp;
Nina was worrying over asking the good-looking young man out on a date.&nbsp;
She was not worried about his reaction, but about what would happen when
he found out about her unusual living arrangements, as he surely would
if she started dating the man.&nbsp; Would he be understanding about her
"Rent", or would he be the kind of guy who would take advantage of it,
dropping by her home at odd times so he could take a look at her naked
body without her being able to do anything about it.&nbsp; Nina needed
to think about it some more, but she was itching to go out sometime.&nbsp;
It would be nice to have a social life again.
<p>Her mind filled with these thoughts as she entered the large file storage
area, she almost didn't hear the metallic scrape from the back of the room
or the small feminine whimper that accompanied it.
<p>Curious, she walked around the file carousels to where a large section
of regular shelving was standing.&nbsp; Back here was where maintenance
stored the excess office equipment owned by the firm.&nbsp; Old roller
printers vied for space with boxes of unused copy paper and almost antique
telephones.&nbsp; The firm evidently threw nothing away.
<p>Nina heard another whimper, and she rounded a corner in the very back
and encountered a disaster.&nbsp; It looked like a shelf unit had collapsed,
bringing down a bunch of old manual typewriters, filling the aisle from
side to side.&nbsp; Under this mess, seemingly pinned down, was a young
blonde woman with a frightened look in her eyes.&nbsp; She saw Nina and
almost screamed, then quickly sighed in relief.
<p>"Oh thank God," she said.&nbsp; "You're a woman.&nbsp; I could really
use your help!"
<p>"Oh, God," Nina said, looking at the mess, "What happened?&nbsp; Are
you hurt?&nbsp; I'll go get some help!"
<p>"NO!" screamed the blonde.&nbsp; "Please...don't!&nbsp; I just need
a little help.&nbsp; Please?"
<p>Nina could see the blonde really didn't want anyone else to be there,
so she nodded and stepped forward.&nbsp; Examining the mess, she could
see that the old fashioned typewriters had really locked themselves together;
the strikers and keys combining themselves into a metal web.
<p>"What happened?" Nina asked, tugging gently on one of the machines.
<p>"I was sent down here to pick up one of these monstrosities for a charity
fundraiser.&nbsp; I work right now for an antique store that specializes
in old machinery.&nbsp; The typewriter I'm currently...er...sitting on
is supposed to be very rare and valuable.&nbsp; Your firm donated it."
<p>Nina looked up.&nbsp; The blonde was blushing, and Nina could see why.&nbsp;
Not only had the typewriters intertwined with each other, they had also
hooked themselves into the simple dress the blonde was wearing...or almost
wearing.&nbsp; Tears in the material were already appearing, and it looked
to Nina as if only one button was standing between the blonde's modesty
and her very generous breasts being fully exposed.
<p>'Hasn't this woman heard of a bra?' Nina thought.&nbsp; Then she figured
the blonde probably couldn't find one her size.
<p>"So, how did you end up on the floor?" Nina asked.
<p>The blonde blushed further.&nbsp; "I...er...the one I wanted was on
the...er...top shelf.&nbsp; I had to climb up to get it, and...well...slipped."
<p>"Bringing down the whole mess on top of you," Nina finished with a sigh.&nbsp;
She pulled at one of the machines and heard a rip.
<p>"Oh no!" said the blonde.
<p>"Sorry," Nina replied, now seeing a gaping hole in the blonde's dress
big enough to tell what color panties she had on.&nbsp; "The way your dress
is caught up, it's going to rip a little as I pull these things off you.&nbsp;
It's almost as if they were deliberately trying to rip your clothes off.&nbsp;
Well, at least something like this doesn't happen everyday."
<p>The blonde blushed even further, thinking that things like this happened
far too frequently for her taste.
<p>Nina felt some sympathy for the buxom blonde, knowing what it was like
to suddenly be faced with the humiliation of being undressed.
<p>"My name's Nina," she said, introducing herself.
<p>The blonde mumbled a name that Nina barely caught, but seemed too preoccupied
and embarrassed to say much more.
<p>Nina worked in silence for a moment.
<p>"Dammit, I can't lift these without ripping your dress, and I can't
reach through them to free it.&nbsp; Can you?"
<p>The blond shook her head.&nbsp; She was stuck trying to support her
own body, a typewriter directly under her back.&nbsp; To move her hands
meant lying on it and she could feel that a part of it would actually cut
her if she did.&nbsp; She explained that to her rescuer.
<p>"Okay," said Nina, taking off her jacket and laying it to one side,
"I'm going to have to rip your dress then; there's nothing else for it.&nbsp;
I'll go get you something to wear afterward."
<p>"Thank you, just hurry, please.&nbsp; I'm not sure how long I can hold
this position."
<p>Nina nodded and grabbed a machine.&nbsp; Tugging and pulling, she seemed
to make more progress ripping the blonde girl's dress to shreds than in
moving the mass of typewriters.&nbsp; Sure enough, that lone surviving
button popped, and Nina was treated to the sight of two large, well developed
breasts springing to view.
<p>"Oh no!" said the blonde, seeing this.&nbsp; But she couldn't move to
cover herself, so she blushed furiously at her exposure.
<p>'At least it isn't a guy helping me,' she thought, knowing how much
"help" men had given her in the past.
<p>There was another big rip, and the blonde felt her back suddenly become
bare.
<p>"Oops," Nina said, "sorry.&nbsp; But I think I can lift this up enough
to let you slide out if I can get over to the other side.&nbsp; Hang on."
<p>The blonde watched as Nina tried to step around the mass of typewriters
that blocked the aisle, but the young woman's close fitting skirt hampered
her movements.&nbsp; Nina stepped back, and after a second shrugged.&nbsp;
"Well, I guess I have no other choice.&nbsp; At least this way you won't
be the only one embarrassed today."
<p>Nina smiled, kicked off her shoes, and undid the catch on her skirt,
slipping out of the delicate material and placing it with her jacket.&nbsp;
Now she stood in just her bra, panties, and blouse.&nbsp; The bottom of
the blouse wasn't long enough to hide anything.
<p>The blonde was surprised, but also thankful that the loss of the skirt
allowed the athletic young woman to easily clamber around the dam of typewriters.&nbsp;
Nina crouched down beside her, a slight blush on her own face.
<p>"Okay, I'm going to lift now, and you scoot forward rather than back.&nbsp;
You won't be able to get past the typewriter underneath you otherwise.&nbsp;
Okay?"
<p>The blonde smiled.&nbsp; "Oh, thank you for doing this for me.&nbsp;
You don't know how much I appreciate it!"
<p>Nina smiled back.&nbsp; "Well, I couldn't have left you here like this.&nbsp;
Are you ready?"
<p>The blonde nodded and Nina took up her position.&nbsp; Squatting like
a weight lifter, Nina strained to move the interlocked mass of machines.&nbsp;
A woman her size might not normally have been able to shift the weight,
but Nina's daily swimming regime had built up her musculature to the point
that she could make a difference.&nbsp; It was hard work though, and Nina
could feel the typewriters digging into her as she lifted the awkward load.
<p>"Just a little more," the blonde said, accompanied with more ripping
noises.
<p>Nina doubled her efforts and felt a pull between her own breasts.&nbsp;
Looking down, she saw a striker from one of the machines was poking her
in the chest and had become caught in the material of her blouse.
<p>'Oh no,' Nina thought.
<p>There was another ripping sound, and Nina watched the blonde begin her
slide to freedom.&nbsp; It was like watching a butterfly emerge from its
cocoon, the blonde leaving the tattered remains of her dress behind as
she emerged from the pile in just her panties and shoes.
<p>"I'm out!" said the blonde triumphantly and Nina dropped her load.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, she didn't get away scot-free; there was another rip and
a large tear appeared in the front of her blouse.&nbsp; That wasn't all.&nbsp;
The striker snagged on the front of her bra and Nina was dragged down with
the machines.&nbsp; She was suddenly trapped on her knees, her hands also
caught via her blouse sleeves, with her knees spread wide and the front
of her bra pulled forward.&nbsp; This of course caused her own breasts
to spill out of the garment, and they could be seen hanging through the
rip in the blouse.
<p>"Help me!" Nina yelled.&nbsp; Caught, overbalanced, and suddenly exposed,
she was suddenly frightened.
<p>"Hold on!" the blonde said, glad to be out, but concerned for her rescuer.&nbsp;
The embarrassed and nearly nude blonde clamped an arm over her breasts
and tried to step across the pile of typewriters as Nina had done.&nbsp;
But machinery had shifted a little when Nina lifted it, and the clearance
wasn't the same.
<p>The blonde put a foot wrong and her shapely ankle suddenly became wedged
between two typewriters.&nbsp; Unbalanced, the blonde fell back, catching
her last remaining piece of clothing on a handy carriage return.&nbsp;
Unable to stop her fall, the blonde felt her panties stretch, then snap.
<p>"EEEEK!" she yelled as she landed, and the sudden shift in weight pulled
at the mass of equipment, moving it and snapping open Nina's bra.
<p>Now both women were trapped, and they looked at each other in horror.&nbsp;
Nina was trapped in a kneeling position, her breasts very visible through
her torn blouse, as were her panties due to her wide apart knees.&nbsp;
The blonde was now lying on her back, her hands behind her holding her
off the mass of sharp metal below her, trying not to get impaled and unable
to hide any part of her now nude body.
<p>It was the kind of situation only horny sex-story writers could have
thought up, but it was very real to them, and they both started screaming
for help.
<p>"What's going on back there?" asked a voice, and both Nina and the blonde
shut up.
<p>A frightened look on both their faces, they were relieved to see another
female face poke around the corner at the far end of the aisle.
<p>"Oh thank God, you're a woman.&nbsp; We could really use your help!"
said the blonde.
<p>Nina just grinned, embarrassed beyond measure.&nbsp; "Hello, Helen."
<p>Helen walked toward the mess, eyes wide as she took in the blonde's
nude form and Nina's almost as revealing one.
<p>"When you didn't come back, they sent me down to look for you.&nbsp;
What happened?&nbsp; Shall I go get some help?"
<p>"NO!" shouted both trapped women.
<p>The pile of typewriters moved slightly, as if sensing another victim.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina and Helen climbed into Nina's Geo.&nbsp; Nina wore only her skirt
and jacket; her blouse and bra were wrecked and unwearable.&nbsp; Helen
wore a borrowed robe, her own dress ripped severely up the back.&nbsp;
Together they paused and watched the blonde in her battered red Ford pull
out of the parking lot and into the street.
<p>"That woman is a disaster area," Helen commented.
<p>"She certainly doesn't have much luck with clothes," Nina said, inclining
her head toward the one-way exit to this particular employee parking lot
of the firm.&nbsp; Trapped in the door was the robe the blonde had borrowed,
since her own clothing was completely useless.&nbsp; Somehow, the luckless
woman had gotten the hem caught.&nbsp; Unable to open the door from the
outside and terrified, she had fled completely naked to her car, and driven
off hunched down as far as she could.
<p>Nina hoped she wouldn't have a traffic accident on the way home.
<p>"She's also a danger to be anywhere near.&nbsp; What was her name again;
I want to be able to avoid her?" Helen said acidly.
<p>Nina tried to remember as she started the car.&nbsp; "I think she said
Jenny, but I can't be sure."
<p>The two friends chuckled and pulled out into traffic.
<br>&nbsp;

<p><br>
<p>Part 11, A New Boss.
<p>Nina West sat quietly in the outer office of one of the senior partners
of the legal firm she worked at.&nbsp; She had arrived at work that morning,
almost late, to find a message on her desk from the office of Sarah Wickland,
asking her to come right over.
<p>"Sarah Wickland, huh?" said Nina's friend Helen, who was reading over
her shoulder.
<p>"I don't think I've met her yet," Nina replied, wondering why a senior
partner would want to see her.
<p>"You haven't met the Legallady yet?" Helen said with a smile, "she tries
to meet everyone!"
<p>"Legallady?" Nine asked.
<p>Byron, across the way at his own desk, chuckled.&nbsp; "Oh man, are
you in for a treat!" he said loudly, grinning like a Cheshire cat.
<p>"Why?" asked Nina, knowing that interesting things in her life lately
had a habit of becoming TOO interesting.
<p>"The Legallady is a one in a million!" replied the paralegal.
<p>Nina looked at Helen for help.
<p>"Nina, hon, Sarah Wickland is a Senior Partner, but some say that's
only because she handles a few rather influential clients the firm can't
do without.&nbsp; She also has a reputation of being rather ruthless with
her own staff."
<p>Byron interrupted.&nbsp; "Not to mention the other partners, her clients,
and the legal system itself.&nbsp; People would have called her the Dragonlady,
but too many of the senior wives are already bucking for that one."&nbsp;
He grinned.
<p>"So she's tough, so what?" Nina said.
<p>Helen paused, then she looked at Nina a moment and smiled.&nbsp; "You
know, Nina, I was going to warn you to be careful with her.&nbsp; But on
second thought, I think the two of you just might get along."
<p>"What do you mean?" Nina asked, suddenly worried about the mischievous
look in Helen's eyes.
<p>"Oh, nothing really.&nbsp; Just a few rumors about her clientele.&nbsp;
Probably not true.&nbsp; But if they are, I want details."
<p>"WE want details," added Byron.
<p>Nina looked from one to the other, then all three burst out laughing.&nbsp;
"You guys are bad," Nina said with a big smile.
<p>"Yeah," said Helen, still giggling, "but you had better get going.&nbsp;
You don't want to keep the Legallady waiting!"
<p>Nina nodded and left their office to go to her fate.
<p>Now she sat and stewed.&nbsp; After announcing herself to the secretary
when she arrived, Nina had been told to wait.&nbsp; That wait had lasted
forty-five minutes so far, and all Nina could think about was the pile
of client notes on her desk waiting to be typed up.
<p>So far she had enjoyed her job at the firm, and was beginning to feel
that the Law was really going to be her home after all.&nbsp; All she had
to do was get through her two-year internship here, and then off to law
school she would go.&nbsp; She also had to get through her lease with her
host, Brian Cook.&nbsp; A rather unusual lease that required for rent not
money, but that she spend every minute she was home completely nude.&nbsp;
She was saving money, that she knew, but it was still difficult to do.&nbsp;
Nina sighed.
<p>A well-dressed gentleman stepped out of Sarah Wickland's office and
walked out the door without looking at anyone.&nbsp; The secretary, a balding
young man with bloodshot skin, waited a few minutes and then told Nina
she could go in.
<p>On trembling feet, Nina complied.
<p>Nina stepped into the office of the senior partner and looked around.&nbsp;
It was a nice office, tastefully decorated in a modern style with Greek
overtones and muted colors.&nbsp; It wasn't a corner office, there were
not enough corners available for all the senior partners, but it was big
enough.&nbsp; There was another door leading out of the room, and the side
across from where Nina stood was dominated by some huge windows that showed
the office building across the street.
<p>Seated at a glass desk on the far side was Sarah Wickland, who stood
up and walked around the desk to greet the younger woman.&nbsp; Nina could
see that the woman was younger than she thought she was going to be, and
would have been surprised to learn that the youngest senior partner in
the firm was only forty-four.
<p>"Miss West, it's good to meet you; I'm Sarah Wickland," she said with
a smile, her hand extended.
<p>Nina took it, a little surprised, as this well dressed, pleasant looking
woman didn't look like the hard-ass her friends had described.&nbsp; Nina
figured they were just joking with her and relaxed.&nbsp; "Hi, it's good
to meet you too," Nina said.
<p>"I usually make a point of meeting all the new female employees when
they get here," Sarah said, leading Nina over to some comfortable chairs
that were laid out around a coffee table.&nbsp; "Being the only female
Senior Partner, I try to do my bit to encourage more women to work toward
their goals.&nbsp; I understand that after you are done here, you move
on to law school?"
<p>"Yes, that's right...er,"
<p>"Oh please!&nbsp; Call me Sarah.&nbsp; It's Nina, right?"
<p>"Yes, Sarah," Nina said with a smile.
<p>"Good.&nbsp; Now, you're probably wondering why I've called you in here.&nbsp;
It's not just to meet with you, I'm afraid.&nbsp; I have some work for
you."
<p>"Well sure.&nbsp; That's what I'm here for," Nina replied.
<p>The Legallady nodded and looked at Nina for a moment.&nbsp; "I've gone
over your initial employee assessment, and talked to some of the lawyers
you have worked with already, and all say favorable things about your competence,
intelligence, and attitude, three things I value greatly.&nbsp; There was
also mention of that unfortunate incident in the basement a week ago?"
<p>Nina blushed, thinking back on that embarrassing time, when a pile of
old typewriters had ripped her blouse and bra to shreds, not to mention
all the clothes of the unfortunate young woman who had created the mess
in the first place.&nbsp; Word of the incident had slowly spread through
the firm, but Nina had been relieved that no one else but her friend Helen
had actually seen it.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Don't worry about it.&nbsp; Accidents happen."
<p>"Yes," Nina agreed.
<p>Sarah Wickland smiled some more and looked Nina over.&nbsp; The lawyer
was seated rather casually, leaning back, her legs crossed, with one foot
bouncing up and down slightly.&nbsp; Nina felt a little ill at ease under
her scrutiny.
<p>"I'm also a friend of Brian Cook," she said suddenly.&nbsp; "The dear
man, he helped me a lot with my career, and without his influence I doubt
I would have made partner so soon.&nbsp; He's a good friend, a good man."
<p>Again Nina agreed, genuinely liking the man.
<p>Sarah leaned forward slightly.&nbsp; "I was talking with him yesterday
about you.&nbsp; I thought I'd ask a follow up as it were to my inquiries
about you here.&nbsp; He gives you high marks, says you have the potential
to go far.&nbsp; We also discussed your...rent?"
<p>Startled, Nina flushed deeply.&nbsp; The woman sitting across from her
knew her secret, knew the price she paid for living in the wonderful home
Brian provided for her.
<p>"I...er..." Nina tried to say.
<p>Sarah laughed.&nbsp; "It's alright, dear.&nbsp; You needn't worry.&nbsp;
Brian and I go way back, and what he tells me is held in strict confidence.&nbsp;
You could say that keeping secrets is my stock in trade, and yours is such
a little one really.&nbsp; My clients have far bigger things to keep quiet.
<p>"But that is why I need you, dear.&nbsp; Your situation at home gives
you an understanding of secrets; how important they are.&nbsp; Am I right?"
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Nina replied.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Of course you know you are bound by our Lawyer/Client
confidentiality agreements when dealing with business, that goes without
saying.&nbsp; But situations might arise where such legal confidences do
not apply, and so there becomes a need to trust to your discretion."
<p>Nina nodded, a sinking feeling deep inside her.
<p>The Legallady leaned forward a little more, her eyes focused on Nina's
face.&nbsp; "We don't want...any...secrets to get out now, do we?"
<p>Nina paled.&nbsp; She sudden saw that her friends' warnings were genuine.&nbsp;
Behind the pleasant facade, this woman was steel.
<p>"You can trust me," Nina said.
<p>Sarah stared at her for a moment longer, then sat back with a huge smile.&nbsp;
But somehow, Nina didn't feel any happier.
<p>"Good.&nbsp; Brian said you were the soul of discretion and I can see
that he was right.&nbsp; Now here is what I need from you.&nbsp; Quite
often, my duties don't allow me to see my clients whenever they call and
want a hand to hold.&nbsp; Also, there are duties that can be carried out
perfectly well by a paralegal such as you, without my needing to be there.&nbsp;
It's a sad state of affairs, I know, but I have two dozen clients to deal
with at the moment and not enough time for all of them.
<p>"Your duties then would be varied, and there is also responsibility.&nbsp;
I'm not going to be looking over your shoulder.&nbsp; Do you understand
me so far, Nina?"
<p>"Yes Ma'am," said the confused young woman, elated at the prospect of
being given increased responsibility, yet still uneasy about the threat
she thought she had been given about revealing anything.
<p>"Good," Sarah said, standing up.&nbsp; "Well then.&nbsp; I've had the
files on these clients pulled and they're sitting in my conference room.&nbsp;
I'll sit with you for a half hour or so and will give you the high points
on each of them, but I want you to spend the morning making yourself familiar
with them.&nbsp; This afternoon I have another task for you as well."
<p>She began to walk toward the glass door on one side of the room and
Nina got up to follow.&nbsp; But after only a few steps, Sarah stopped
and turned.
<p>"Brian tells me that you spend all your time at home in the nude, is
that right?"
<p>Nina blushed a little and nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, Ma'am."
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Well, I imagine that after all that time nude,
wearing clothes can sometimes be a little uncomfortable when you first
put them on."
<p>"That is true, Ma'am," Nina had to admit.&nbsp; Quite often she had
felt somewhat restricted by the outfits she wore, something she had never
noticed about clothes before she came to live with Brian Cook.&nbsp; But
still, her occasional discomforts were far outweighed by her happiness
at having something to put on.
<p>"Oh!" replied Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; "Well in that case, don't let me
stop you from being comfortable.&nbsp; This is a private office, and the
conference room is also private.&nbsp; No unexpected visitors here, no
one would dare.&nbsp; Don't let me stop you from removing those uncomfortable
clothes and being comfortable in this office."
<p>"That's alright, Ma'am.&nbsp; I'm quite comfortable, really," Nina replied,
her nervousness increasing.
<p>"Don't be silly, dear.&nbsp; You don't look comfortable to me.&nbsp;
Don't worry...I know how to keep a secret," she whispered, staring Nina
straight in the eye.&nbsp; She continued more slowly.&nbsp; "Now I insist
that you don't let me stop you."
<p>Nina knew that what she had just been given was an order, an order based
on blackmail.&nbsp; She debated for a moment on just leaving, but realized
that for someone like Sarah Wickland to even try this meant that they had
to be very sure of where they stood.&nbsp; Nina on the other hand felt
she didn't have a leg to stand on; so she reached for the buttons of her
blouse, and while checking the door to make sure it was closed, and glancing
at the huge windows, she made another plea.
<p>"Really, it's quite alright..."
<p>"No it isn't!&nbsp; For some reason you're as jumpy as a jackrabbit,
and I need you at ease if I'm to get any work out of you.&nbsp; And don't
worry about me, dear, you haven't got anything I haven't seen before!"&nbsp;
Sarah smiled and walked over to one side of her office where a built in
closet was concealed.&nbsp; She opened it to reveal some zippered up garment
bags.&nbsp; "I wouldn't want that outfit of yours spoiled," she said sweetly,
"It's a genuine IO, isn't it?&nbsp; You can keep it in here, it'll be safe.&nbsp;
Go on!"
<p>Feeling like she was in a dream...a rather bad one, Nina slipped off
her jacket and carried it over to her new boss.
<p>Sarah watched closely as Nina kicked off her shoes and undid her skirt,
sliding the garment down her legs and revealing a pair of blue bikini panties.&nbsp;
Sarah took the skirt and examined it.&nbsp; "This IS nice, and expensive
I would imagine.&nbsp; IO does some wonderful work.&nbsp; You must have
cried when your blouse got ruined last week."
<p>Nina could almost cry now.&nbsp; She was prepared to strip at home,
it being a daily occurrence for her, and she was even getting used to being
stared at by the gardeners once a week, and Brian the rest of the time.&nbsp;
But here at the firm, the one place she felt secure from all that, she
now felt helpless.&nbsp; Unable to say a word, she finished undoing the
buttons of her silk blouse, and after hesitating a moment, she slipped
it off, revealing that she wore no bra underneath.&nbsp; It just happened
to be one of 'those' blouses that day.
<p>Nina flushed, and handed it over, wanting to cover up but thinking she
didn't dare.&nbsp; Sarah took the blouse and proceeded to look at it admiringly,
but she also gave Nina, who was now left only in her panties and jewelry,
a good once over as well.
<p>"This is a nice blouse," Sarah said, feeling the material and noticing
how her hand could be seen through it, "and I can see how hard it would
be to wear a bra under it.&nbsp; But looking at you I can see you don't
need the support yet, dear."&nbsp; She slipped it into one of the garment
bags hanging in the closet while Nina stood and blushed.
<p>Sarah turned back to her and raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "Not done yet,
Nina," she said.
<p>Nina bit her lip and dug her thumbs under the waistband of her panties,
slipping them off quickly and handing them over.&nbsp; She watched Sarah
pop them in the bag with the rest of her clothes, including her shoes she
saw, and watched in horror as Sarah zipped the bag up and popped the lock
at the top.
<p>"Why did you lock the bag?" Nina asked.
<p>"Oh!&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; Must be force of habit.&nbsp; Don't worry, I
have the key.&nbsp; Now, let's get to work!"
<p>Sarah led the very nervous Nina through into the conference room.&nbsp;
Nina walked quietly, not knowing where to put her hands, and dreading what
she might see in that room.&nbsp; But what she saw was a room decorated
like the Senior Partner's office, but about half the size.&nbsp; It was
dominated by a large table that looked like it could easily seat twelve,
covered in files of various thicknesses.&nbsp; There was also another door
that presumably led to the hallway outside.&nbsp; The door had the only
internal window in the room, frosted glass Nina was glad to see.&nbsp;
But like the office next to it, large windows opened up its other end,
and Nina could see the building across the street.&nbsp; It's windows showed
nothing of it's interior, Nina hoped the same was true looking in this
direction.
<p>Sarah acted as if nothing was unusual, and began going through the files.&nbsp;
Nina found it hard to concentrate though, the feel of the leather-covered
chair against her skin, the plushness of the carpet between her bare toes.&nbsp;
It was anything but like a business atmosphere for Nina.&nbsp; Yet, after
Sarah left her alone and she started reading the files, Nina did begin
to relax.&nbsp; But she never forgot her nudity.
<p>Still, the clients in those files had a fascination all their own.&nbsp;
Many lived in the same neighborhood as she and Brian Cook, and one or two
of the names were familiar to her on their own merits.&nbsp; Nina was impressed,
and began to think that meeting some of these people just might be worth
stripping for Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; So with an ever-increasing smile, Nina
kept working.
<p>Sarah Wickland surprised Nina several hours later by bringing in a couple
of sandwiches and some drinks.&nbsp; Having her boss in the room made Nina
conscious of her nakedness all over again, but the woman didn't seem to
react.&nbsp; Instead, she insisted on eating with the younger woman, chatting
about how Nina found things at the firm so far, if she had suffered any
discrimination because she was a woman, and if she had made any friends
yet.&nbsp; Nina answered honestly and was soon again lulled into a sense
of security about her nudity, and the two finished their meal with a lot
less tension than when they started.
<p>"I have to run to the County Court for an hour," Sarah said when she
finished eating.&nbsp; "When I come back, I'll send you on that errand
I mentioned earlier."
<p>"Sure thing, Sarah," Nina replied.&nbsp; "I'll be fine.&nbsp; Oh, I
do have a question for you.&nbsp; Do I report up here from now on?"&nbsp;
Nina was wondering if she had to leave her office and her friends several
floors below.
<p>"Oh no.&nbsp; If I need you, I'll call.&nbsp; You can depend on spending
your mornings down there, generally, but your afternoons for the most part
will be mine.&nbsp; Now, I really have to go, back in an hour!"
<p>Sarah left and Nina got back to work.&nbsp; But she soon found out she
had a problem after all.&nbsp; The drinks she had at lunch only accelerated
the problem, but she realized she hadn't been to the bathroom all morning.&nbsp;
Nina looked at the clock and thought she could wait, but the need to go
quickly rose to painful heights and she couldn't keep still.
<p>Nina peeked into Sarah's office to see if anyone was there, and discovering
it empty, she went to the closet where her clothes were kept.&nbsp; She
struggled with the little zipper lock that sealed the garment bag, but
it was no use.
<p>"Damn!" she swore.
<p>Thinking as fast as she could, while practically dancing across the
carpet, Nina considered her options.&nbsp; Outside in the outer office
was probably Sarah's male secretary, and Nina had no desire to be seen
by that creepy looking guy.&nbsp; The only other way to a bathroom was...the
door in the conference room.
<p>Nina ran over to it and opened it carefully, desperation overpowering
her fractured modesty.&nbsp; She looked both ways down the hall, seeing
it empty, and swallowing hard, she stepped out and ran as fast as she could
toward where she thought she saw some restrooms.
<p>She was in luck, she made it to restroom without being seen, and she
burst into a stall as fast as she could, at that point not caring if anyone
was in there.
<p>Relief could not have felt so sweet as she peed, it's calming affect
reminding her of something she saw as she ran for the stall.
<p>Urinals.
<p>'Shit!' she thought.&nbsp; 'I'm in the men's!'
<p>To compound her difficulties she heard the door open and the sound of
two men arguing.&nbsp; Nina lifted her feet and held her breath, not wanting
to make a sound.&nbsp; She didn't want to have to explain why she was naked
in the Men's Room on the floor of the Senior Partners.&nbsp; She tried
not to think about what discovery would cost her.
<p>Instead, she sat perfectly still, and watched through the cracks around
the door, as two well dressed men argued a point of law as if they were
in court.
<p>Another man came in, and Nina almost groaned.&nbsp; It was getting crowded
in here and she knew she was near discovery for sure.&nbsp; But as the
guy walked by her stall, Nina recognized him as Sarah's male secretary.&nbsp;
She heard a stall two doors down being opened, and the sound of a zipper.
<p>Nina blinked and waited, and a moment later the two arguing lawyers
left the restroom; that just left the secretary.
<p>Nina felt the urge to move.&nbsp; She knew she couldn't stay any longer.&nbsp;
She got to her feet and crept out into the restroom, heading for the door.
<p>Nina took a peek outside and, seeing the coast was clear, made another
mad dash for the conference room.&nbsp; She grabbed the doorknob but it
wouldn't turn.&nbsp; It had locked behind her.
<p>Desperate, she shook the door, then realized that with the secretary
in the bathroom the outer office would be empty.&nbsp; Nina ran down the
hallway without any more thought and dashed into the outer office, which
was thankfully unoccupied.
<p>With a huge sigh of relief, the naked young woman stepped into Sarah
Wickland's office and was brought up short.
<p>Sarah was standing behind her desk looking up at her.
<p>"Really Nina, I knew you were adjusting to being nude a lot of your
time, but I didn't realize you felt comfortable enough to leave the office
like that.&nbsp; I guess I underestimated you.&nbsp; You'll do just fine
working for me; I have no worries on that score.&nbsp; Now, your assignment
for the afternoon."&nbsp; Sarah smiled and held out an envelope.
<p>Nina sighed.

<p>Part 12, The Errand.
<p>Nina West, dressed finally after a morning nude in her Boss's office,
pulled her car into the driveway.&nbsp; She parked and checked the house
number against the address on the envelope she had been given by Sarah
Wickland, otherwise know as the "Legallady" and Nina's new boss.&nbsp;
The address was right, so Nina got out of her little Geo and stared curiously
at the house.
<p>Nina had never seen a house without any windows before, but that wasn't
the half of it.&nbsp; The place hardly looked like a home what so ever.&nbsp;
Dominated by concrete and steel, it looked more like one of those government
research facilities than a home.&nbsp; Its only redeeming features were
its muted lines and skillful landscaping.&nbsp; If it wanted to look like
a high tech research facility, at least it made the effort to be an unobtrusive
high tech research facility.&nbsp; But according to Sarah Wickland, it
WAS a house.&nbsp; Nina wondered what kind of person would want to live
in a place like this.
<p>Nina hadn't recognized the name on the envelope, but Sarah had told
her that the client was a recluse and a bit eccentric.&nbsp; Still, several
million dollars worth of legal business each year passed through the firm
from this one client alone, so Sarah and the other Senior Partners had
learned to look the other way.&nbsp; No one was willing to rock the boat
here, something the Legallady had stressed strongly with Nina before she
was allowed to get dressed.
<p>"He's been with us for years because we don't comment on his lifestyle
and accommodate his needs," she said.&nbsp; "I don't expect you to be a
doormat, but he's a grumpy bastard and no doubt you will be surprised by
a few things when you get to his home.&nbsp; But all you have to do is
go there, give him these papers, which he'll sign and give back to you,
then drop them off here.&nbsp; I know you can do this, Nina."
<p>Nina figured she could, after all, it sounded simple.&nbsp; She was
a little worried about what she was going to find when she reached the
client's home, but the relief at getting her clothes back outweighed her
worry and by the time she got there she had forgotten most of the warning.
<p>Looking up at the house brought it all back.
<p>'Oh well, here goes nothing,' she thought, and she made her way up the
driveway to the front door.
<p>At the door she pushed a button on what looked like an intercom, and
waited.&nbsp; She turned as she waited, looking at the flowers, the nearby
houses, enjoying the warmth of the sun on her face, and the dusty smell
of a hot day, and wondered why anyone would want to live in a house as
sealed up as this one looked to be.&nbsp; Even the front door looked like
it belonged on a space ship rather than a home.
<p>"Hello!" said a female voice over the intercom a moment later.
<p>"Hello.&nbsp; My name is Nina West; I have some legal papers here for
Mr. Hargrave?&nbsp; You're expecting me!"
<p>"Yes, Miss West; he has been expecting you.&nbsp; Please step inside
and follow all instructions."
<p>"Instructions?" Nina asked.&nbsp; But instead of an answer, the door
opened sideways with a hiss.
<p>Nina stepped into a small entryway and blinked.&nbsp; It all looked
like it was made out of white fiberglass, something she was destined to
see a lot more of as she progressed further into the house.&nbsp; But at
the moment, she just faced another door and a shelf to one side where several
sets of shoes sat.&nbsp; The front door closed behind her with a pneumatic
thump.
<p>"Please remove your shoes and place them on the shelf," said the same
female voice.
<p>"Er...I'll be barefoot without them," Nina said.&nbsp; She hated wearing
stocking or hose so rarely ever bothered.
<p>"That will be fine," the voice replied.
<p>Nina was glad she could still be heard and, setting her briefcase down
she slipped off her work shoes and sat them on the shelf with the others.&nbsp;
The door in front of her then opened to reveal a slightly bigger room in
the same decor.
<p>Again there was another door, and more shelves, but there was also a
horizontal slot in the wall.&nbsp; Nina looked at it feeling rather nervous,
and she jumped when the door behind her closed.&nbsp; She looked at it,
seeing if there was a way of opening it, and saw a button marked "Open"
in plain view on the wall next to the door.&nbsp; It calmed her down a
little.
<p>"Please remove the papers you wish Mr. Hargrave to see, and place them
in the slot," said the voice.
<p>"I can't do that," Nina said.&nbsp; "I think I'm supposed to hand them
to him myself."
<p>"Miss West, your firm has accommodated Mr. Hargrave in the past over
these matters.&nbsp; Is it to be a problem now?"
<p>Nina thought about what Sarah Wickland had said about not making waves
with this client and sighed.&nbsp; "No, it's not a problem, but I should
at least witness his signatures."
<p>"This is your first visit here, is it not?" said the voice.
<p>"That's right, I've never been here before," Nina replied.
<p>"Then I must inform you that the interior of this house is a clean room
environment and is hermetically sealed.&nbsp; You will have to go through
a brief cleansing procedure before entry.
<p>Do you agree to this?"
<p>'Ah', Nina thought, 'this guy is a Clean Freak'.&nbsp; It was actually
a weight off her mind.&nbsp; Her imagination had been running wild ever
since getting out of the car.
<p>"Sure," she said with a smile.
<p>"Very well, then please place the proper papers in the slot, and your
briefcase on the shelf.&nbsp; You will not be bringing the case in with
you."
<p>Nina complied, digging out the envelope she had been given and laying
it in the slot.&nbsp; She saw a light come on inside, and guessed correctly
that a high-powered ultraviolet light was being used to clean the paper.&nbsp;
The envelope disappeared into the slot, carried away by a little conveyor
belt.
<p>"Please remove all your garments and place them in the receptacle provided,"
continued the voice.&nbsp; A locker sized door in the wall opened up.
<p>"What?" Nina asked.
<p>"You need to get undressed to go through the cleansing process.&nbsp;
Don't worry it's quite harmless.&nbsp; It only kills germs."
<p>"Why can't I stay dressed for it?"
<p>"Your clothing makes it difficult to clean your skin.&nbsp; Don't worry;
you're not the only one who has to go through this.&nbsp; Any visitors
to Mr. Hargrave's home have to go through it and I go through every day
I work here."
<p>"Oh," Nina replied.&nbsp; She blinked again, thinking about how she
had already had to undress in front of a stranger today, and now she had
to do it again.&nbsp; She had not thought that nudity would ever been a
job requirement.
<p>Reluctantly, Nina took off her jacket and undid her skirt.&nbsp; She
hung both up in the locker and slowly removed her blouse, rendering herself
topless.&nbsp; Blushing, she slipped off her panties and placed them with
the rest of her clothes before standing naked with her arms tight around
her body.
<p>She was nervous now.
<p>"Rings and other jewelry too I'm afraid, and your watch."
<p>Nina looked up, startled.&nbsp; Evidently she could be seen, but she
couldn't see a camera anywhere.&nbsp; It made her feel vulnerable knowing
that she was being watched as she stood there naked.&nbsp; Nina wondered
how many people could see her.&nbsp; Could Mr. Hargrave?&nbsp; Nina quickly
removed her watch and jewelry and placed them with her clothes.
<p>The next door opened.
<p>Hesitantly, Nina stepped through it.
<p>This room was smaller, about the size of the entryway.&nbsp; There was
yet another door on the other side, but instead of shelves there were two
recesses about shoulder height with handles deep inside them.
<p>The door behind her closed.
<p>"Please hold the handles using both hands, and place your feet in the
yellow circles," said the voice.
<p>Nine did so, looking down to see the yellow circles that made her spread
her feet about two feet apart.&nbsp; She reached out and managed to grasp
a handle in each hand.&nbsp; She knew she was very spread out like this,
not a portion of her anatomy covered by anything.&nbsp; Angry, Nina hoped
the cameras were getting some good shots, because she felt humiliated and
scared.
<p>"The next part may seem a bit disturbing, but it only lasts twenty seconds.&nbsp;
I'll need you to hold your breath during this time.&nbsp; Can you do that
for me?"
<p>Nina nodded, not daring to speak.&nbsp; What she really wanted to do
was run back to her clothes.&nbsp; But she had to witness the signatures
and she knew the firm was counting on her not to screw up with this client.
<p>"Ready?" asked the voice.
<p>Nina nodded again.
<p>"Take a deep breath...hold it!"
<p>Nina took her breath, happy at least that she could do that easily enough,
when she felt something grip her wrists and ankles.&nbsp; She was about
to let out her breath and look when suddenly the room was filled with water.&nbsp;
Unable to see, unable to breath, Nina stood stock still for a few seconds
as multiple jets hit her with some kind of soapy cleaning solutions from
all angles.&nbsp; Then she tried to move, but found her wrists and ankles
held fast in some clamps of some sort.&nbsp; She wanted to call out, to
ask what was going on, but she dared not open her mouth.&nbsp; Every inch
of her body was being pummeled by the sprays, and her hands and feet were
especially saturated.&nbsp; So was the area between her legs, and Nina
kept shifting her hips trying to get away from the hard sprays from that
direction.&nbsp; But she was trapped, and the relentless onslaught began
to have an effect on her.
<p>Spread out as she was, the sprays were pounding her clitoris and her
nipples, and poor Nina was being stimulated in a way that shocked her.&nbsp;
There was also a hard spray that was threatening to shoot water right up
her ass.
<p>Then the water changed.&nbsp; Slightly cooler, it seemed cleaner to
Nina.&nbsp; No soap, no chemicals; it seemed to Nina to be a rinse of some
kind.&nbsp; Then it stopped and the chamber filled with air, blowing all
around her.&nbsp; Nina realized that this was the same thing as the hot
air blower in her own bathroom at home, so she stoically waited until the
air blew her dry.
<p>The rush of air stopped, the clamps released, and Nina was once again
allowed to move.&nbsp; She immediately began to rub her crotch in an attempt
to calm her forced arousal, but stopped as the door in front of her opened.&nbsp;
She was not happy, but vowed to see it through for the sake of the firm.
<p>This door opened up into a normal looking lobby, if normal meant that
most everything in the room had to be made out of white plastic or fiberglass.&nbsp;
Nina had to blink under the harsh lighting as all that white reflected
light everywhere.
<p>A dark shape moved and took on the appearance of a head, hands and legs
lot in a sea of white.&nbsp; Nina blinked again and she saw it was a youngish
woman in a white smock, and Nina immediately covered up.
<p>"It's alright, I'm Sally, Mr. Hargrave's nurse and secretary.&nbsp;
Welcome."
<p>"Er...hi!" Nina said.
<p>Sally smiled and handed Nina a folded up package.&nbsp; "You can put
that on while you're here," she said, turning away, "you won't be here
long enough for us to have to launder your clothes.&nbsp; Come with me
and you can see Mr. Hargrave sign those papers."
<p>Nina was grateful for the covering although it felt rather strange.&nbsp;
As she unfolded it she discovered that it was made of paper, white of course.&nbsp;
It didn't appear to have any fasteners and looked very simple, basically
just a jacket, and it didn't look big enough.
<p>"Say, wait a minute!" Nina called out to the retreating nurse.
<p>"No time, he's waiting for you, come on!"
<p>Nina ground her teeth and slipped on the paper gown.&nbsp; It was only
just big enough to go around her bust and she had to hold it closed with
one hand, and not quite long enough to cover her front and rear.&nbsp;
Nina pulled it down a bit to cover her pussy, and she heard a slight rip
behind her.&nbsp; Her hair was still wet and it was soaking the paper on
her back, weakening it.
<p>"Shit," she said, wondering what else was going to go wrong, and she
hurried after the nurse, her bare feet thumping against the sterile floor.
<p>She followed the nurse down a hallway until she stopped at a large window
set in the wall.&nbsp; Through this Nina saw a very sterile looking bedroom
with an old man sitting on a bed.
<p>Surprised, Nina pulled harder on her paper gown, and she felt it give
behind her.
<p>"Oh no!" she said, looking helplessly at the nurse.
<p>"What's the matter?" Sally asked.
<p>"It's coming apart, my gown's coming apart," Nina said, half panicking
now.
<p>"It's okay, it'll last.&nbsp; Just stop pulling on it," Sally said helpfully.
<p>Nina just stared at her until the occupant of the other room caught
her attention.
<p>"You there, girl!" said a voice over a speaker.&nbsp; The old man waved
some papers at her, the same ones Nina had brought by the look of them.&nbsp;
"You're new, aren't you?"
<p>"Yes, Sir," Nina said, appalled at meeting such an influential and important
client while naked under a rapidly disintegrating paper shirt.&nbsp; She
felt she should have been properly dressed in her designer suit and wondered
what Mr. Hargrave must have thought of her.
<p>Hargrave couldn't have cared less.&nbsp; He simply put the papers down
on a nearby table, signed them, popped them back in the envelope they came
in, and slipped them into a slot in the wall.&nbsp; "Give Brian my regards,
will you?" were his last words, before turning to something else and ignoring
the girls outside.
<p>"What?" Nina asked.
<p>"Come on, let's go," said Sally, "The papers will be waiting for you
in the dressing room."
<p>"Is that it?" Nina said.&nbsp; "I got undressed, sprayed by God knows
what, and made to stand here half naked, just for that!"
<p>"Well, you did want to see him sign those papers, most usually wait
in the entry.&nbsp; Now come on, I'll take you back."
<p>Nina was livid, but held her peace as she was escorted back the way
she came.&nbsp; As she stepped through the first door, she didn't see the
amused smile on the nurse's face.
<p>Thankfully, Nina didn't have to get washed again to leave, but she did
have to wait until each door behind her closed before the next one opened.&nbsp;
She eventually peeled off what was left of her paper gown and got dressed.&nbsp;
Then, grabbing the papers and her briefcase she left the building without
looking back.
<p>It had not been a good day for Nina West.

<p>Part 13, Kelly &amp; Christopher.
<p>A bead of sweat formed slowly on tanned skin.&nbsp; It sat unnoticed,
one among many, on a smooth shoulder.&nbsp; Small movements kept it oscillating
back and forth; and as it touched other drops, it absorbed them, growing
in size.&nbsp; Soon its own weight became its worst enemy, and it began
to lose a grip on the silky skin of its host.&nbsp; It started to slide,
urged on by the slight movements that had created it.&nbsp; Forward it
ran, its speed increasing as it found a steeper decline.&nbsp; But instead
of slipping off the edge, surface tension kept a stern grip on it, and
it continued to move upside down along the tanned flesh.&nbsp; The path
it traveled grew smoother yet after a couple of bumps, and it followed
a course only a lover could trace, until it ended up at its lowest point.&nbsp;
Hanging off a coral tinted nub of flesh, the drop changed shape, pulled
down by gravity yet held up by surface tension.&nbsp; Its continuous movements
across this sensitive spot were noticed.
<p>Nina West wiped the sweat from her right nipple and settled back down
to read.&nbsp; She was lying face down in the sunroom at the top of the
house, bathed in sweat and light, reading some material she had brought
home from work.&nbsp; She could have had the air conditioning on to cool
the room, but Nina found she liked to sweat up here for a while, before
running down to the pool for an invigorating swim.
<p>She absentmindedly reached behind herself and wiped more sweat from
her left ass cheek and rolled slightly onto one side, revealing more of
her nude body to the room.&nbsp; No tan lines could be seen, for she lived
in the house on the condition that she always be nude there, a condition
that promoted all over tanning very nicely.
<p>Nina wasn't thinking of that, however; just the brief in her hands that
she was trying to understand.&nbsp; She was therefore startled when she
heard Mrs. Terry.
<p>"Miss West?"
<p>Nina blinked and looked up from her papers.&nbsp; Standing at the top
of the spiral staircase that led up to this room was the housekeeper.&nbsp;
She too was nude as was her custom, and her being barefoot was why Nina
didn't hear her come up.
<p>"Hi," she said, unconsciously moving the paper she was holding up to
cover her breasts.
<p>"Mr. Cook would like you to come down; there is someone he would like
you to meet," Mrs. Terry said with her normal dour expression.
<p>Nina began to panic.&nbsp; "Like this?" she asked, meaning her nudity.
<p>"Of course, Miss West," said the housekeeper.&nbsp; "But it's okay,
nothing to worry about."
<p>As the housekeeper went back down the stairs, Nina laid back and tried
to calm down.&nbsp; It was all well and good for Mrs. Terry to say not
to worry, but Nina still did.&nbsp; She had hoped she would have grown
used to walking the house and grounds naked after all this time, but just
when Nina seemed to find her feet, something unusual happened to knock
her off balance again.
<p>And now there was a visitor, a new person to expose herself to.&nbsp;
Nina sighed and closed her eyes.&nbsp; A week before, after coming home
from a particularly humiliating day, she sat down and calculated just how
bad her monetary situation was.&nbsp; The figures did not look good, and
she saw that with the rent she owed right now, plus the bill from IO hanging
over her head, there was no way she could buy her way out of her lease.&nbsp;
The only option open to her unless she came across a lot of money, was
to continue her agreement.
<p>Nina shook her head and got up.&nbsp; She looked down at herself and
grimaced.&nbsp; She was covered in sweat, her hair a stringy mess, and
she knew she stank.&nbsp; Nina knew that if she had to show her naked body
off to someone, she at least had to make it presentable or be even more
humiliated.&nbsp; There was no time for a swim; she decided to take a shower
instead, so down she went to her room.
<p>---***---
<p>"Ah, there she is at last!" said the elderly Brian Cook, beaming at
the arrival of the much cleaned up Nina.&nbsp; "Come in, dear girl; I have
a surprise for you!"
<p>Nina paused in the doorway of the salon and looked around nervously.&nbsp;
At first she thought Brian was alone in the room, and then she saw the
girl standing on the far side, dressed in a halter and denim shorts.
<p>"Hi!" said the girl with a smile, her eyes looking Nina up and down.
<p>"Er..." was all Nina could manage.
<p>"Nina, dear," said Brian, "this is my granddaughter, Kelly.&nbsp; I
told you about her, remember?"
<p>Nina did.&nbsp; Kelly was the granddaughter in college, the one whose
car Nina was now driving.&nbsp; Nina stood stock-still, appalled that Brian
Cook was showing her off to his family.&nbsp; What must they think of her,
standing there naked?
<p>Nina shot him a dirty look, which he caught with a raised eyebrow.
<p>"Hi Nina, I'm glad to meet you," said the girl.&nbsp; She was still
smiling, and didn't seem at all put out by the fact Nina was nude.&nbsp;
She walked forward to shake hands.
<p>Nina was confused.&nbsp; "Er...hi.&nbsp; I'm sorry for the way I'm dressed..."
was all she could think to say, still in shock.
<p>"Oh don't worry about it," said Kelly, "it REALLY doesn't bother me."&nbsp;
Kelly gave Nina a foot to head look and the older girl started to blush.
<p>Kelly giggled.&nbsp; "Don't worry, you're not my type.&nbsp; But you
might be my brother's!"
<p>Brother?&nbsp; Nina remembered that Kelly was a twin with a brother
named Christopher.&nbsp; "Your brother, is he here?" Nina asked.
<p>"Yes, said a male voice close behind her, and Nina jumped.&nbsp; She
quickly turned to see a young man standing not three feet behind her.&nbsp;
He was casually dressed in slacks and a loose fitting shirt, and was handsome
the way Kelly was pretty.&nbsp; Nina also wondered how long he had been
standing there getting an uninterrupted look at her naked behind.
<p>Nina flushed and moved to one side, placing the wall at her back.&nbsp;
Being the only naked person in the room tended to put her on the defensive.&nbsp;
Brian of course noticed this.
<p>Christopher wasn't smiling, but he did nod in her direction before walking
into the room.&nbsp; "Again, Grandpa?" he said, shaking his head and gesturing
at Nina.
<p>"My art requires it, Christopher," Brian said slowly.
<p>Christopher didn't answer, instead turning to his sister.&nbsp; "I finished
unloading the car; your makeup bag is in the lobby."
<p>"Thanks, Bro," Kelly said, smiling at her brother.
<p>Christopher nodded and headed for the door.&nbsp; "I'd better get going."&nbsp;
He paused in front of Nina, his eyes glancing quickly across her body before
locking on her face.&nbsp; He held out his hand.&nbsp; "I'm sorry I was
rude.&nbsp; I'm Christopher, pleased to meet you."
<p>Nina took his hand, it was warm and dry, and she shook it.&nbsp; "That's
okay, you aren't the only one surprised today," she said.
<p>Kelly looked at her grandfather.&nbsp; "Don't tell us you didn't warn
her we were coming!"
<p>Brian chuckled.
<p>"Grandpa!"
<p>Christopher shook his head again as the old man laughed.&nbsp; "One
of these days, old man, you're going to go too far," he said before turning
back to Nina.&nbsp; "My apologies for my grandfather.&nbsp; I'm not sure
why you're doing what you're doing for him, but be warned.&nbsp; He thinks
of his art more than he thinks of the people around him sometimes."
<p>"Don't talk crap, Chris!" said Kelly.&nbsp; "It was a good joke, lighten
up."
<p>Christopher sighed, then leaned in closer to Nina.&nbsp; "Walk me to
my car, will you?"
<p>"Why?" Nina asked, still nervous.
<p>"Just...walk with me."
<p>"Sure."
<p>Christopher turned to face his family.&nbsp; "Don't worry, she'll be
back.&nbsp; I just want to warn her what she's gotten herself in to."
<p>"It was good of you to drop Kelly off on your way south, Christopher,"
Brian said, walking over to give his grandson a quick embrace.
<p>"Hey, it was the quickest way to get rid of her for a few weeks, and
I know she likes staying here with you in this house of mirrors."
<p>Brian chuckled, and the two men separated.
<p>"Later, Bro," Kelly said, smiling at Christopher with a knowing look.
<p>Christopher gave her a quick smile and left the room, taking Nina by
the arm as he did so.
<p>Nina felt very strange being led out of the house, naked as she was.&nbsp;
She looked up at Christopher's handsome young face and wondered what clouded
it, for he seemed to be so serious, unlike his sister who never lost her
smile.&nbsp; There were family dynamics here that Nina would have loved
to unravel.
<p>Christopher led her out to his car, an older model Ford sedan.&nbsp;
He stopped before they reached it.
<p>"Look, I'm sorry about all that.&nbsp; Three days alone in a car with
my sister, and I'm pretty much ready to kill.&nbsp; Usually I'm a lot easier
going."
<p>"That's okay, I know how long trips can bite!" Nina replied.
<p>Christopher looked her up and down again quickly before he turned away
to look at the house.&nbsp; "This...er...modeling, you're doing for my
grandfather.&nbsp; Is it one of those 24/7 type deals, he won't let you
dress at all?"
<p>"Yes, it is; why?" Nina asked, concerned.
<p>Christopher shook his head.&nbsp; "It's nothing, it's just that we've
seen him do that before, many times.&nbsp; For the most part, it usually
ends up okay, but a couple of his former models ended up quitting.&nbsp;
He tends to be a bit much sometimes.&nbsp; But you're safe here, that's
for certain."&nbsp; He looked her up and down again, a slight flush to
his own cheeks.&nbsp; "You're also one of the better looking models he's
had."
<p>Nina blushed.&nbsp; "Thank you."
<p>Christopher looked uncomfortable, and to cover it up he checked his
watch.&nbsp; "I need to get going, I'm staying at a friend's for a while.&nbsp;
If you need anything; to talk, to decompress, I'm not too far away.&nbsp;
Ask Mrs. Terry; she knows where I'll be and how to get hold of me.&nbsp;
Okay?"
<p>Nina nodded, finding herself captivated by his eyes.
<p>"Okay, then; I hope to see more of you later, then!"
<p>Nina suddenly giggled.&nbsp; "That's hardly possible," she said.
<p>Christopher blushed and climbed into his car.&nbsp; With a wave he drove
off, and Nina watched him go.
<p>"You like him, don't you!" said a voice by the front door.
<p>Nina turned; it was Kelly, still smiling.&nbsp; She was looking right
at Nina, and something about the look made Nina very aware of her nudity.
<p>"He seemed like a nice guy," Nina replied, not wanting to say any more.
<p>"Chris is a very nice guy.&nbsp; Boring, but nice.&nbsp; Still, the
girls usually like him.&nbsp; Me, I prefer a little more action."
<p>"Action?"&nbsp; Nina was almost afraid to ask.
<p>Kelly grinned, and Brian came to the doorway.&nbsp; "Well," he said,
"shall we?"
<p>"Oh yes; come on, Grandpa, come on, Nina!"
<p>"Where are we going?" Nina asked as the others moved by her.
<p>"To start my vacation!" Kelly called out, raising her arms and spinning
around.
<p>Nina followed the dancing Kelly and the sedately paced Brian Cook down
the driveway to the garage.&nbsp; As always as she got near the main gate,
Nina carefully watched the road outside for cars, not wanting to expose
herself, and she followed the others inside.
<p>As they went up the interior steps to the apartment where her clothes
were locked up, Nina thought that they were letting her get dressed for
a trip off the property.&nbsp; But instead, she was surprised when Kelly
picked up a couple of suitcases and carried them into the locked bedroom
after Brian opened it.
<p>She was even more surprised when Kelly immediately began undressing.
<p>"What?" Nina asked.
<p>"Nina, my dear.&nbsp; While Kelly stays with me, she likes to live under
the same rules I impose on you.&nbsp; She does it because she wants to,
and I can't bring myself to deny her!" Brian said with a smile.
<p>"But...so...why don't you use HER as a model?" Nina asked.
<p>"Because unlike you, Nina, young Kelly is very comfortable with her
nudity.&nbsp; She presents the wrong image entirely.&nbsp; Look!"&nbsp;
He pointed at his granddaughter, and Nina was shocked to see her naked.&nbsp;
Her tomboyish figure was slim and evenly tanned, and she stood quite unashamed
in front of the mirror, giving her own body a critical examination.&nbsp;
She caught Nina's eye in the mirror and winked.
<p>"I'm glad you're here, Nina.&nbsp; This is always more fun with someone
to share it with," Kelly said.
<p>Nina didn't know how to reply.
<p>"Grandpa, I'm going to go for my record this time.&nbsp; I want to beat
it."
<p>"How long was it last time, Kelly?" Brian asked her politely.
<p>"Three weeks, four days, eleven hours," she replied.
<p>"How long was what?" Nina asked.
<p>"How long without ever putting any clothes on," replied Kelly as she
turned and walked over to Nina.&nbsp; She took Nina's hands in her own.&nbsp;
"And you're going to help me break my record.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be fun
if we did it together!"
<p>Nina almost fainted.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina lay half asleep in her bed, her mind awash in thought.&nbsp; She
was still trying to get her head around the sudden appearance of her host's
energetic granddaughter, and the fact that she apparently enjoyed her nudity
with a gusto that gave Nina pause.
<p>All through dinner, the nude young woman didn't stop talking.&nbsp;
She told her grandfather all she had been doing at school, studying apparently
not being one of them, and she quizzed Nina incessantly on her own college
experience.&nbsp; Nina knew that Kelly wasn't THAT much younger than she
was, yet she felt ages older.
<p>Then there was her brother, dark, calm...many things Kelly wasn't.&nbsp;
Nina felt herself flush as she thought about him, and smiled.
<p>She thought about him now, in bed.
<p>There was a knock at her bedroom door and it opened slightly.&nbsp;
Nina froze.
<p>"Nina!" said a whispered voice.
<p>Nina remained still, it sounded like Kelly.
<p>"Nina!&nbsp; Are you awake?"
<p>Nina heard footfalls in the silent room and she knew Kelly had come
in.&nbsp; That made her nervous.
<p>"Nina!" Kelly said a little louder and Nina couldn't pretend to be asleep
anymore.
<p>"What is it?" she said sitting up, holding the sheets across herself.
<p>Kelly grinned.&nbsp; "I didn't think you'd be asleep yet.&nbsp; Come
on, I want to go swimming!"
<p>Nina glanced at her bedside clock, big red numbers glowing in the dark.&nbsp;
"It's two in the morning!" she protested.
<p>"Early yet!&nbsp; Come on, I know you don't have to go to work tomorrow."
<p>"I just want to sleep," Nina said leaning back.
<p>"Don't tell me you've gotten old already!" Kelly said, mocking her.&nbsp;
"Come on, a swim in the ocean will do you some good!"
<p>"The ocean?" Nina asked.
<p>"Sure, the ocean.&nbsp; You wouldn't think I'd be making all this fuss
over a dip in the pool.&nbsp; Come on!"
<p>Nina started to slide out of bed, wondering what the hell she was doing.&nbsp;
"What about your record to stay naked?"
<p>"Who said anything about getting dressed first?&nbsp; Come on!"
<p>Browbeaten, Nina got out of bed and followed her new housemate.&nbsp;
As they padded quietly down the stairs, Nina began to think that a nighttime
swim in the ocean might not be a bad idea after all.&nbsp; It was only
thirty minutes to the nude beach, and it was bound to be deserted.&nbsp;
It could be fun.
<p>Nina was actually smiling by the time the girls reached the garage,
and she and Kelly exchanged grins as they climbed into the Geo.
<p>"Top down!" Kelly yelled, pushing the button that sent the soft top
motoring back, and Nina looked back nervously as Kelly piloted the car
out of the building and onto the street.
<p>This wasn't Nina's first time naked in a car, and not the first time
with another naked woman.&nbsp; It was the first time however with a naked
woman singing at the top of her lungs with the radio cranked up.&nbsp;
Nina kept a sharp eye out for cops, nervous they were going to be picked
up for disturbing the peace and arrested for indecent exposure.&nbsp; In
the end, she had enough and turned the music down.
<p>"Hey, what gives?" Kelly said at the sudden silence.
<p>"Don't you think we should be a little discreet as we are driving?&nbsp;
Neither of us is wearing a stitch!" Nina told the slightly younger woman.
<p>"Yeah, I guess you have a point.&nbsp; I don't want to get picked up
again this early into my visit," Kelly replied.
<p>"You mean you've been picked up by the police before?" Nina asked, eyes
wide.
<p>"Sure," Kelly said with a big grin, "how else did you think my streaking
records got stopped?"
<p>Kelly started laughing and Nina groaned.&nbsp; Then she noticed that
they were not on the way out of town.&nbsp; "Where are we going?"
<p>"To the beach, like I said!"
<p>"But Buffalo Beach is the other way."
<p>"Oh, we don't want to go all the way out there!"
<p>"What?&nbsp; We can't go to a public beach like this!" Nina exclaimed.
<p>"Sure we can!&nbsp; I do it all the time."
<p>"Well I'm not going.&nbsp; Take me back!" Nina demanded.
<p>Kelly smiled and pulled the car over next to the curb.&nbsp; "I'm not
going to take you back, but you're welcome to get out right here and walk."
<p>Nina gasped, it was at least a couple of miles.&nbsp; "You wouldn't
put me out here!"
<p>Kelly lost her smile.&nbsp; "Wouldn't I?"
<p>There was a pregnant pause as Nina realized that under Kelly's bubbly
exterior was someone as hard as stone, who got what she wanted, when she
wanted.&nbsp; Nina paled.
<p>Kelly's smile slowly returned.&nbsp; "We're almost there anyway."
<p>True enough, a couple of minutes later they reached the public parking
lot next to the beach, and they pulled in.
<p>Kelly immediately jumped out of the car and ran screaming onto the sand.&nbsp;
Nina silently watched her, then she turned and scanned all the beachfront
stores and homes across the highway.&nbsp; All looked dark.
<p>"COME ON, NINA!" yelled Kelly, making Nina wince.
<p>"Quiet down!" Nina called back in a softer voice.
<p>"I'M GONNA KEEP YELLING UNTIL YOU COME OUT HERE!"
<p>Nina climbed out of the car just to shut her up.&nbsp; She covered her
breasts with her arms and ran quickly out of the parking lot lights and
onto the darker sand.&nbsp; It felt cool to her bare feet.
<p>"That's a girl.&nbsp; Come on, let's have that swim!" Kelly said, and
she led the way into the water.
<p>The water did feel good, and once again Nina felt that she could leave
her troubles on the shore.&nbsp; It felt weird being out there in the darkness,
so the two girls didn't stray far from shore.&nbsp; They swam in the shallows
and enjoyed the illicit feel of swimming on a public beach completely naked.
<p>Nina was actually having a good time when she spotted lights sweeping
into the parking lot.
<p>"Look!" she said, standing up in the water.
<p>Kelly turned and the young women watched as two cars parked on either
side of the little Geo.&nbsp; Kelly broke into a smile and began to wade
to shore, but Nina was scared.
<p>"Wait, where are you going?" Nina cried out.
<p>"Come on, Nina!" Kelly yelled over her shoulder as she made her way
to shore.
<p>Nina stood her ground, bracing herself against the swells that tried
to push her to the beach, and watched as eight guys in jeans and jackets
climbed from the cars.&nbsp; They milled around the Geo for a few moments,
then one of them spotted Kelly mounting the beach.&nbsp; To Nina's dismay,
he waved; and to her horror, Kelly waved back.
<p>"Hey, it IS Kelly's car," Nina heard one of the guys say, and the others
all looked at the naked young woman as she strutted across the sand to
meet them.
<p>There was a general atmosphere of greeting, with all the guys stepping
onto the sand, and soon Kelly was surrounded by eight college age guys
who were all laughing and getting a good look at the smaller girl's nude
form.
<p>"When did you get back into town, Kel'?" one of them asked her.
<p>"Just today," she replied, acting as if these guys were old friends,
which it looked like they were.&nbsp; She seemed totally unconcerned that
she was the only one in the group without any clothes, and Nina wondered
how she could be so cavalier about something like this.&nbsp; It was when
Kelly started pointing her way, making the guys search the water line,
that Nina's blood really turned cold.&nbsp; Kelly was telling them she
was out here!
<p>"Nina!" Kelly called out.&nbsp; "Come on, Nina, it's okay.&nbsp; These
guys won't hurt you; they're friends of mine!&nbsp; Come on, I want to
introduce you to them!"
<p>Nina felt like dying, anything but walking out there completely naked
to meet eight men.&nbsp; Yet she figured she was without a choice at that
point.&nbsp; Miles from home with no way of getting there; she was stuck.&nbsp;
And the water was too cold in the dark to hide in for much longer.
<p>"NINA!" yelled Kelly, and a few of the guys joined in.
<p>Screwing up her courage, Nina stood up and began to wade ashore.&nbsp;
She began to blush when she was greeted by cheers and wolf whistles from
the guys, who appreciated her Venus act.&nbsp; Not looking at them, Nina
walked up the beach until she stood just outside the group, very aware
of all the eyes on her body.
<p>"You sure have a beautiful friend, Kel'," one of the guys said, and
the others murmured their agreements, making Nina blush all the more.
<p>Kelly, grinning as always, introduced them all.&nbsp; "Guys, this is
Nina; she's staying at my Grandpa's for a while.&nbsp; Nina, these are
the guys."&nbsp; She rattled off their names, all of which Nina failed
to catch.
<p>"Are you going for a record too, Nina?" one of them asked.
<p>"Record?" Nina said, confused.
<p>"You know, like Kelly.&nbsp; A record for being naked?"
<p>Nina shook her head, embarrassed as hell.&nbsp; Kelly spoke for her.&nbsp;
"Nah, not Nina; not yet, anyway.&nbsp; I just dragged her out of bed to
come swimming!"
<p>The men laughed, and one of them suggested they dig out the beer.&nbsp;
So a few minutes later Nina found herself sitting on the sand with a beer
in her hand, with eight dressed guys and another naked woman.&nbsp; It
was very surreal.
<p>Nina sat directly on the sand, her knees to one side hiding her pussy,
and one arm across her breasts.&nbsp; She still felt completely on display,
but it was the best she could do.&nbsp; Kelly on the other hand sat across
the circle from her, cross-legged, talking in a very animated fashion with
her arms waving, her small breasts jiggling with her movements.&nbsp; She
acted just like she wasn't naked, and Nina wondered if the girl had any
modesty what so ever!
<p>Kelly would have drawn the rapt attention of every guy there with her
display, but Nina couldn't help noticing them all giving her looks as well.&nbsp;
In one way, Nina wasn't surprised.&nbsp; Put eight healthy guys together
with a couple of naked women, and there was bound to be looking.&nbsp;
It didn't make it any easier, though.&nbsp; What did help was the conversation.&nbsp;
As it flowed around her, Nina could see that Kelly really was a friend
with all these guys, old friends; and that they were very used to Kelly
being nude around them.&nbsp; They made the usual jokes and sexual innuendoes
that guys would make in theses situations, but Nina didn't get any bad
vibes from any of them.&nbsp; Her fears of her and Kelly getting gang raped
on the beach rapidly faded.
<p>As the seawater evaporated from her skin, the night air felt colder
to Nina, and she began shivering.&nbsp; Someone else noticed too, and Nina
felt a jacket placed over her shoulders.&nbsp; Startled, she looked at
the guy sitting next to her, who regarded her with a concerned expression.
<p>"You looked cold, I hope that helps," he said.
<p>"It does, thanks," Nina said quietly, enjoying the warmth the jacket
gave her and the covering.&nbsp; She gave him a smile and got one in return,
a handsome smile on a good-looking face.
<p>"I'm Jim," he said, holding out his hand.
<p>Nina shook it, parting the jacket as she did so.&nbsp; "Hi Jim, thanks."&nbsp;
Nina noticed his eyes dip to the gap she opened up for just a second or
so, and she smiled.&nbsp; She had already been completely exposed to these
guys for a while now, yet this guy still took a brief look when he could.
<p>Jim leaned over a little.&nbsp; "Tell me the truth, you're not into
being naked near as much as our Kelly is," he said quietly.
<p>"How could you tell?" Nina asked wryly, taking a sip of her beer.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "I doubt anyone is as unconcerned about clothes
as Kelly.&nbsp; She'd go everywhere like that if it were legal.&nbsp; How
did she get you to come out here like this, anyway?&nbsp; We looked in
the car; you didn't leave any clothes there."
<p>"Like she said, she got me out of bed," replied Nina, enjoying how his
face moved.
<p>Jim chuckled again.&nbsp; "Yeah, and she just managed to convince you
to drive all the way out here naked for a swim.&nbsp; I think you enjoy
this more than you let on."
<p>Nina giggled, and was surprised at how relaxed she was.&nbsp; Not a
real drinker, Nina put it down to the beer and vowed not to have anymore.&nbsp;
She and Jim continued to whisper together though, and their conversation
didn't go unnoticed by several of the guys, and of course Kelly, who watched
them closely for a minute.
<p>Then Kelly stood, brushing the sand from her bare body.
<p>"Well, guys," she said, patting the sand from her ass cheeks, "we'll
have to get together later.&nbsp; But now I need my beauty sleep.&nbsp;
Come on, Nina, let's go."
<p>"Sure," Nina replied and she stood up as well.&nbsp; She brushed the
sand from herself and politely refused offers of help from a few of the
guys, then reluctantly surrendered Jim's jacket back to him so she was
once more nude.
<p>"Bye, guys!" Kelly said as she started back to the car.&nbsp; She and
Nina only got a few yards though, when the guys fell silent.
<p>One of them coughed, and in the still night air could be heard a tiny
jingle, jingle.
<p>Nina's blood ran cold and she and Kelly turned to see one of the guys
holding up a set of keys, the keys to the Geo that Kelly had left behind
in the car.&nbsp; "I think you'll need these," he said with a smile and
the other guys laughed.
<p>"Come on guys, not again!" Kelly said.
<p>"Sure, again; we want to welcome you back!" replied the guy with the
keys.
<p>"It's a bit late for games, isn't it?" Kelly said, and Nina wondered
what games she was talking about.&nbsp; She was about to find out.
<p>"This is an easy one, just to get you back into the swing of things.&nbsp;
You and Nina get your keys back only if you take a dare."
<p>"What dare?" Nina said.
<p>"Go across the street and go completely round the block.&nbsp; Make
it back here, and you win your keys!"
<p>"Are you INSANE!" Nina yelled, but Kelly started giggling.
<p>"It's okay, Nina, it is a pretty easy one.&nbsp; We can do it."
<p>"YOU can do it if you want," Nina said angrily, "but I'm not going."
<p>"You both have to do it," said Jim, standing up.&nbsp; "Whoever doesn't
has to walk back.&nbsp; We'll make sure you get home safe, but you still
walk."
<p>Nina couldn't believe that the nice guy she had just been talking to
could have come up with something like that.
<p>"You're not serious!" she said to him.
<p>"Oh, he IS!" Kelly said.&nbsp; "These guys have made me walk back a
number of times.&nbsp; But this is an easy one.&nbsp; We can do this, Nina.&nbsp;
Come on!"
<p>The other guys started urging them on, and again Nina felt like her
choices were being taken away from her.&nbsp; She looked at Jim, who shrugged
and gave her an encouraging smile, before mouthing the words "Trust me,"
in her direction.
<p>Swallowing, Nina eventually nodded and she and Kelly made their way
across the well-lit parking lot.
<p>While all this had been going on, the occasional car had driven by on
the highway, but otherwise the beachfront looked quiet and deserted.&nbsp;
Trembling with fear, Nina followed Kelly across the street to the stores
on the other side.&nbsp; Kelly grinned and the two naked girls crept along
the sidewalk until they reached the corner.&nbsp; They had to duck and
hide behind a low wall as some traffic passed.
<p>"These guys have done this to you before?" Nina whispered to Kelly.
<p>"Oh sure.&nbsp; It's all in fun.&nbsp; They can be pretty creative sometimes,
especially Jim.&nbsp; He's a sneaky bastard."
<p>"How can you let them do this to you?" Nina asked.
<p>Kelly turned to her new friend.&nbsp; "Because it's fun.&nbsp; Don't
you think so?"
<p>Nina didn't know what to think.
<p>Traffic quieted down, and Kelly jumped up and started running.&nbsp;
Nina lost no time in scrambling after her, and the thump of bare feet on
sidewalk accompanied the two nude beauties as they raced to the next corner.&nbsp;
They made it easily, and rounding it, headed for the next one.
<p>It was halfway down this side of the block that they were spotted.&nbsp;
A group of maybe three or four street bums was congregated near a storefront
right in their path.&nbsp; In the darkness, neither Kelly nor Nina had
spotted them until they were almost up to them.&nbsp; They spotted the
girls though, and amid hoots and hollering that threatened to waken the
entire neighborhood, Nina and Kelly ran right through them.
<p>Kelly was laughing her head off, the exhibitionist in her reveling at
the exposure.&nbsp; Nina ducked her head in shame as she tried to concentrate
on keeping her boobs from bouncing too much.&nbsp; It came as a real surprise
to her when one of the bums gave her ass a well-timed swat with his bare
hand.&nbsp; The powerful strike made her yelp, and the smack was loud enough
to be heard by all.&nbsp; This made the rest of the bums laugh, and Nina
felt the sore handprint on her right cheek all the way around the rest
of the block.
<p>Getting back to their car, Kelly was more out of breath from laughing
than from running, while Nina stood to one side rubbing her sore ass.
<p>"Thanks guys!" Kelly said to all as she started hugging each of them,
"I really needed that!&nbsp; It's good to be back!"
<p>"You're welcome, Kel'," said the guy with the keys and he tossed them
back into Kelly's hands.
<p>Jim had walked around the car to where Nina stood alone.&nbsp; "You
okay?" he asked her.
<p>"Not really, we found some bums and one of them hit me," Nina replied,
glaring at him.
<p>"Let me see.&nbsp; Turn around.&nbsp; Come on."
<p>Nina turned, not knowing why she was doing so, and showed her bare butt
to him.
<p>"It's just a bit red, you'll be fine," Jim said with a smile.
<p>"No thanks to you!" Nina said.
<p>"You mean you didn't have fun?" Jim said to her, a knowing smile on
his face.
<p>"You just made me streak around a city block!"
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "Yes, and it was a rush, wasn't it?&nbsp; I think
you liked it, but just don't know it yourself yet."
<p>Nina was about to offer him a biting reply when the car horn tooted.&nbsp;
"Come on, Nina, I'm ready for bed.&nbsp; You can talk to Jim another time.&nbsp;
Night guys!"
<p>As the rest of the men said their goodbyes, Nina slipped into the passenger
seat.&nbsp; She stared at Jim, who looked back at her until Kelly drove
them out of the parking lot.
<p>On the drive home, Nina thought about Jim, about Christopher, about
Kelly and her wild friends, and about that humiliating run around the block
and why the hot handprint on her ass had melted into a deeper heat within
her.
<p>Had she liked it after all?&nbsp; More to the point, was every day with
Kelly around going to be like today?

<p><br>
<p>Part 14,&nbsp; The Weekend.
<p>The weekend began for Nina much earlier in the week, although she didn't
know it.&nbsp; Nina's new boss, Sarah Wickland, had spent a good hour Tuesday
morning arguing a motion with the judge of one of her more prominent cases.
<p>It was rare when Sarah ever needed to go to court; most of her cases
settled well before then, but she had an obstinate client, a sleazy opposing
lawyer, AND a judge more worried about his upcoming vacation time than
his job, to contend with.&nbsp; What's more, this particular lawyer had
been sandbagging her, stalling her discovery requests.&nbsp; By law, he
had to show her all he had, but the trial was fast approaching and she
knew he hadn't.&nbsp; That's what she was arguing about.
<p>Judge Williams sat silently at his desk, slowly going through the motions
and counter motions filed by both sides over the so-called missing paperwork,
and pretty much ignored the two opponents snapping at each other like two
little dogs.&nbsp; When eventually he did raise his head, he bellowed for
silence and then ruled in favor of Sarah.&nbsp; She was to get all she
asked for; Frank Morgenstern was to hold nothing back.
<p>He didn't, or at least it didn't seem that way.
<p>Thursday afternoon, over forty boxes of files, receipts, and other such
paperwork was delivered to the firm and to Sarah Wickland's office.&nbsp;
Seeing this huge pile and knowing her opponent was trying to bury her in
paperwork, Sarah was on the phone immediately with the judge to complain.&nbsp;
Her complaint fell on deaf ears.&nbsp; He told her that she had asked for
everything, and everything was what she got.&nbsp; He also refused her
request for a continuance; trial would start promptly at 9:00 am Monday
morning.
<p>Sarah wasn't beaten yet, though; she had a reputation of being tough,
and it was well earned.&nbsp; She knew that somewhere in this pile was
the evidence she needed to win this civil suit, and she wasn't going to
let anyone snow her under, even if it meant working all weekend.
<p>With a smile, she had Franklin, her secretary, catalog the boxes while
she reached for the phone.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina just happened to be working in her own office that afternoon.&nbsp;
Normally she would have been upstairs in Sarah's office, but another lawyer
had needed the extra hands for a project so Sarah had reluctantly let her
go.
<p>For Nina it had meant an afternoon at work with clothes on, something
she rarely got to have since she started working for the Legallady.
<p>The phone on her desk rang, and Nina picked it up without looking at
it.&nbsp; "Nina West speaking," she said brightly.
<p>"Nina, this is Sarah.&nbsp; Could you come up here please?&nbsp; Something
has come up!"
<p>Nina paled, her thoughts on actually staying dressed for more than a
few hours fading away.&nbsp; She looked up at the clock and saw it was
almost quitting time, but that didn't mean much to Sarah.&nbsp; Nina groaned.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am, I can be up in a few minutes," she said, trying not to
show her disappointment in her voice.
<p>"Thank you.&nbsp; Oh, one more thing.&nbsp; There's another girl, Helen.&nbsp;
Bring her too, I need to talk to both of you."
<p>"Helen, Ma'am?" Nina asked, wondering what was going on.
<p>"Yes, bring her with you."&nbsp; Sarah hung up, so Nina put the phone
down.&nbsp; She sat in thought for a minute, wondering what the emergency
was and why Helen had to go with her, then she smiled as she realized she
wouldn't be spending time naked upstairs.&nbsp; So far Sarah hadn't let
anyone see Nina upstairs without any clothes on, not even her creepy looking
male secretary, so Nina felt safe.
<p>"Say, Helen?" Nina said, getting her friend's attention.
<p>Helen looked up from her computer, busy trying to finish the retype
of a deposition she had been given.&nbsp; "Whaaaat!" she said.
<p>"You and I have to go upstairs, we've been summoned."
<p>This made Helen stop typing.&nbsp; "What do you mean, summoned?"
<p>"Sarah Wickland wants us," Nina said with a shrug.
<p>"You mean just you, right?&nbsp; You're the one who works with her."
<p>"She wants us both."
<p>Helen was rather surprised, and she wondered what the Legallady wanted
from her.&nbsp; "When?"
<p>"Right now," answered Nina.
<p>Helen sighed and looked at her computer.&nbsp; "Okay, let's go."
<p>---***---
<p>Franklin had them wait for twenty minutes while Sarah was on the phone.&nbsp;
Then he let them into the inner office with a greasy smile that gave both
young women the creeps.
<p>As Nina entered the office she had come to know so well, she couldn't
stop herself from glancing at the hidden closet where her clothes had been
held hostage so many times, and her fingers almost reached for the buttons
of her blouse on their own accord.
<p>Sarah Wickland was behind her glass desk, and she stood up and walked
over to the door leading to her conference room.&nbsp; Without a word,
she opened the door and gestured the two young paralegals inside.&nbsp;
What they saw on the other side of the door made them shudder; it was almost
full of cardboard file boxes.
<p>"Ladies, I present to you our weekend," Sarah said with a grimace.
<p>"What?" Helen said, turning to look at the Legallady.
<p>"Nina, you know about the upcoming trial?&nbsp; Dah vs. Cronenberg?&nbsp;
Well, here are all the files we've been petitioning for since we got the
case.&nbsp; Ten years of disciplinary reports, receipts for permit passes,
fines, and whatever other kinds of junk their bastard lawyers decided to
throw at us!"&nbsp; Sarah was not in a great mood.
<p>Nina began poking at one of the boxes.&nbsp; "Don't tell me we have
to go through all this stuff," she said dismally.
<p>"Oh yeah, every box, every file.&nbsp; And we have to get it done by
Sunday morning so I can prepare my case for trial on Monday."
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "Ms. Wickland, that will take all weekend
if we're lucky, and I have plans this weekend."
<p>"Cancel them!" ordered the lawyer.
<p>"Cancel them?&nbsp; Do you know how long it took me to arrange..."
<p>"I don't care, Helen.&nbsp; I need you and Nina to help me get this
done.&nbsp; Between the three of us, we should be able to sort out all
this paper in time, but I need you.&nbsp; Besides, this is what you do
here.&nbsp; You work for the firm, and the firm right now is ME.&nbsp;
Unless of course, you would rather NOT work for the firm?"&nbsp; Sarah
looked levelly at Helen, who wilted.
<p>"Okay, okay.&nbsp; I guess I'm spending the weekend here with you guys,"
she said.
<p>"No, not here," Sarah said, showing the girls back into her own office.&nbsp;
"I don't care much for throwing away a weekend either, but I'll be damned
if we're going to waste it here in this office.&nbsp; The trial is being
held in Buffalo County, neutral territory for all concerned, except that
my home is out that way.&nbsp; We'll meet there tomorrow; I'll have Franklin
ship that mess in the other room out there.&nbsp; Then we can at least
enjoy some pleasant surroundings while we work.&nbsp; We can even go swimming
on our breaks; you like to swim, don't you, Nina?"
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>"Well then."&nbsp; Sarah smiled and began showing the paralegals the
door.&nbsp; "Franklin will give you directions.&nbsp; Be prepared to spend
the entire weekend with me, no driving back here at night.&nbsp; Pack for
the weekend, but pack casually, very casually."
<p>Both girls nodded, each one thinking about how her plans were shot,
although Nina was actually a little relieved.&nbsp; Her new housemate,
Kelly, had been making noises about having a party over the weekend, and
as she would certainly be partying naked, Nina knew that Kelly would insist
she did too.&nbsp; Nina would have been very nervous spending the weekend
alone with Sarah Wickland, but with Helen along, Nina figured there would
be none of the nudity Nina had to normally endure with this woman.
<p>Who knows, it might actually be fun!
<p>Sarah's last words as they left the office were, "I'll see you both
out at my place bright and early at 8:00 am."
<p>Helen groaned.
<p>---***---
<p>"So what's the big deal on this case anyway!" yelled Helen over the
wind as she drove Nina and herself out to Sarah Wickland's Friday morning.&nbsp;
"What's it about?"
<p>Nina began to blush, wondering how to talk about this rather unusual
case.
<p>Helen glanced over at her friend and noticed the red face.&nbsp; She
also noticed how well Nina filled out her T-Shirt and shorts, and how her
long legs showed off their well muscled tan.&nbsp; Helen felt a little
frumpy in comparison in her blouse and pants.&nbsp; She pushed the thought
out of her head and tried to concentrate.
<p>"You might as well tell me; I'm going to find out anyway!"
<p>Nina nodded, sighing.&nbsp; "Do you know about the Cronenberg School
for Girls?" Nina said.
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "Can't say that I have!"
<p>"Well, neither had I before I first saw this case, and I'm kinda glad.&nbsp;
Cronenberg is one of those disciplinary schools, the kind of school you
send kids to who can't be handled any place else.&nbsp; But it's a private
school; they don't just take any problem kids, usually only the ones with
rich parents."
<p>"Sound's like they would fit in around here!" Helen commented.
<p>"Not all the kids are problem kids, though.&nbsp; Quite a few are there
simply because their parents approve of the way these girls are handled,"
continued Nina.
<p>"So what's the problem?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina glanced at her friend.&nbsp; "The er...school...this branch anyway...recently
changed its disciplinary measures, and a lot of the parents are up in arms
about it.&nbsp; They want the school to return to its previous rules and
get back in line with the other Cronenberg schools.&nbsp; They're pretty
upset.&nbsp; The leader of the group they formed, Jacob Dah, sued the school
over its change of policy.&nbsp; The other parents joined in, and now the
school is fighting back."
<p>"Who's likely to win?" asked Helen, curious.
<p>"I don't know, to be honest.&nbsp; I've only seen the first brief and
heard Sarah grumble about it.&nbsp; But neither side is willing to settle,
so it's going to court!"
<p>Helen shrugged.&nbsp; "So we get stuck in the middle, great.&nbsp; What
did they change, anyway?"
<p>Nina looked down.&nbsp; "Are you sure you've never heard of this school?"
<p>Helen shrugged.&nbsp; "The name doesn't ring a bell.&nbsp; Why, do they
torture their students?"
<p>"No...well...that might be up for debate."
<p>Helen looked over at her friend, intrigued by that answer.&nbsp; "Now
you HAVE to tell me."
<p>"Er...well, at Cronenberg, they use humiliation as a tool to discipline
the girls.&nbsp; Any infraction of the rather stiff rules they have there
means a girl can lose items of clothing for a while.
<p>"What?" Helen said, thinking it was a joke.
<p>"From what the brief said, these girls can be stripped naked if the
infraction is serious enough."
<p>"You're kidding!&nbsp; And they changed that?&nbsp; Good for them!"
<p>"Well, not all of it.&nbsp; The girls can still be stripped on campus,
but when leaving the school, any girl without clothes is given a bright
yellow plastic sack to wear so she doesn't have to appear naked in public."
<p>"Wait a second.&nbsp; That's what they changed to?&nbsp; Are you trying
to tell me that before the change, these poor girls were allowed out in
public without clothes?"
<p>"I think so," Nina said, rather uncomfortable with the idea herself,
knowing the feeling of being without clothing and away from someplace safe.
<p>"That's illegal, isn't it?" Helen said.
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "Not for Cronenberg students, not in their
home county.&nbsp; Legislation was passed allowing the school to operate
as they saw fit.&nbsp; But someone got cold feet anyway, and changed how
they issue their discipline in public."
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "That's crazy.&nbsp; And you know what's
even worse?&nbsp; This suit is about parents WANTING their daughters exposed
in public like that."
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "Here's the turn off."
<p>The house was large and flat, done in a Grecian style that reflected
Sarah Wickland's office decor.&nbsp; Pillars and statues decorated the
front yard, and Nina was surprised to recognize the style of one or two
of the stone nudes.&nbsp; After seeing her host's art studio, and the pieces
of his own work that he decorated his own property with, Nina was quite
familiar with his composition.&nbsp; The familiar look of embarrassment
or shame, the half hidden bodies caught in that vulnerable moment.&nbsp;
Brian Cook certainly had a talent for bringing out that image in stone.
<p>Nina then realized something else.&nbsp; Brian had plans for several
depictions of her OWN nude body.&nbsp; Up until now Nina hadn't really
thought about what would happen to those statues after they were made,
but seeing this display brought home to her the fact that people might
buy them.&nbsp; Nina realized that her nude form done in stone would be
looked at by hundreds, maybe thousands of people, and could last for longer
than a lifetime.
<p>Just imagine having people look at your nude body for a hundred years!
<p>Nina got the shivers and missed noticing something she would have found
very interesting.
<p>Helen took one look at the statues and blushed.&nbsp; She looked away
and didn't look back.
<p>The two girls got out of their car and carried their single bags up
to the front door.&nbsp; It was opened as they approached by Sarah herself,
standing in the doorway in a dark blue bikini.
<p>"Come in, come in," she said, and the young women walked in, a little
stunned at the sight of the senior partner in such skimpy clothing.&nbsp;
Sarah filled out her swimsuit well at that, her forty-four-year-old body
looking at least a decade younger.&nbsp; "Go through to the left, there's
a bedroom four doors down you can share while you're here.&nbsp; Change
into swimsuits if you like, we'll be working out by the pool anyway today!"
she said.
<p>The girls mumbled their greetings and made their way to their assigned
room.&nbsp; Through to the left brought them out into a courtyard in the
middle of the house with a small pool and a fountain.&nbsp; Off the courtyard
were doors to various rooms, one of which was theirs.&nbsp; Nina quite
liked the space and the layout of the house; its Greek themes evident even
here.
<p>"Great place!" Helen said as they went into their room.
<p>"Beautiful.&nbsp; But wow, I didn't expect to see her in a swimsuit,
did you?" Nina asked.
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "Do you think we should join her?"
<p>Nina said yes, knowing personally that a "suggestion" from Sarah Wickland
was nothing different from an order.
<p>The girls changed quickly, Helen showing some embarrassment at getting
undressed in front of Nina, while it didn't even occur to Nina to be embarrassed
at all.&nbsp; It was when they were half changed that Sarah poked her head
in the door.&nbsp; "Everything all right?" she said with a smile.
<p>Helen had only just pulled on her bikini bottoms and quickly grabbed
the top, holding it to her chest and blushing.&nbsp; Nina on the other
hand was still naked, sorting out the suit she hadn't worn in over a month.&nbsp;
She had her back to the door and simply looked over her shoulder at her
boss.&nbsp; She flushed a little, but didn't jump to cover up as Helen
had.
<p>"We're fine, thanks," Nina said, knowing that Sarah was going to get
in the games she could.&nbsp; Once again, Nina was glad Helen was there
so she wouldn't have to spend the entire time naked.
<p>Sarah grinned and left them alone.
<p>"That was weird," Helen said.
<p>Nina only nodded and got dressed.
<p>When they came out, they saw Sarah waiting for them across the courtyard.&nbsp;
"Come on over, let's have some breakfast!" she said, so the young women
dutifully padded over.
<p>As she walked, Nina looked about the courtyard for the huge pile of
boxes they were supposed to go through, but only saw several long tables
set up as if to receive them.&nbsp; "Where are the files, Ma'am?" she asked.
<p>Sarah frowned.&nbsp; "Not here yet.&nbsp; I've been on the phone with
Franklin half the morning over this and he assures me they'll be here soon.&nbsp;
In the meantime, let's eat."
<p>They sat down to a simple breakfast, and while they ate and engaged
in small talk, Nina noticed that for a change she was probably the most
dressed person around.&nbsp; Both Sarah and Helen wore bikinis, although
Helen's was rather more conservative.&nbsp; But Nina wore a swimmer's one
piece, designed for someone who spends a lot of time crawling through the
water rather than sitting beside it looking pretty.&nbsp; Nina had to grin.
<p>Her grin faded however when she looked over at Sarah.&nbsp; Her boss
was giving her a critical eye.&nbsp; She shook her head.&nbsp; "I don't
know where my manners are today.&nbsp; Look at you!" she said, making Nina
go pale and Helen look up confused.
<p>"What's the matter?" Helen asked.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Helen, dear.&nbsp; Wouldn't you agree that as your
hostess it's my duty to see that you are comfortable here as my guests?"
<p>"Er...sure!" said Helen.
<p>"Oh no," whispered Nina, knowing what was coming.
<p>"Of course it is.&nbsp; I have to make sure that you feel at home while
you're here.&nbsp; And of course, I know that YOU know how Nina here stays
comfortable at home.&nbsp; Hmmmm?"
<p>Helen looked blankly at Sarah for a moment, then it dawned on her and
she smiled.&nbsp; "Yeah, I guess I do.&nbsp; But I didn't know YOU knew."
<p>"Oh, Brian Cook and I are old friends, he tells me everything."&nbsp;
She smiled once more and focused on Nina again.&nbsp; "Now I know that
suit just HAS to be less comfortable than what you are used to, not to
mention the way it would just RUIN your beautiful all-over tan.&nbsp; So
don't be ashamed when you take it off; we'll understand, won't we Helen?"
<p>Nina looked at her friend who grinned back at her.&nbsp; "Sure, I won't
mind, it won't be anything new to me to see her naked."
<p>"Helen!" Nina said, shocked at her friend's amusement.
<p>"Well then," continued Sarah sweetly, "Nina, I can hardly insist that
you wear that suit since you would be more comfortable without it.&nbsp;
In fact, I could hardly insist that you wear ANYTHING while you are staying
here.&nbsp; Treat my home as yours, I insist!"
<p>Sarah gave Nina a look that Nina had come to know well.&nbsp; So she
stood up, and without a word, peeled off her suit until she stood naked
once more.&nbsp; She blushed furiously, even though both women had seen
her nude quite a bit already.&nbsp; It was not their looking that embarrassed
her, but how Sarah had manipulated her.&nbsp; Nina, to be honest, was getting
rather tired of being manipulated, but she couldn't see any way out of
it.
<p>"There you are, more comfortable already.&nbsp; Now come sit down and
finish your food.&nbsp; We'll soon have a lot of work to do."
<p>Nina sat, her ass in direct contact with the wrought iron seat, and
ate as best she could while she tried to calm down.&nbsp; She knew she
would get used to this, as she did working naked at the office; it only
took time.&nbsp; At least she wasn't naked in front of strangers again.
<p>While she adjusted, she listened to Sarah and Helen talk.
<p>"You live here alone?" Helen had asked her.
<p>"Now I do, yes.&nbsp; I used to have a live-in maid, but she left several
years back," replied the Legallady.&nbsp; "I have a service come in and
clean the whole place once a week, but otherwise it's just me; I enjoy
the solitude."
<p>Helen nodded.&nbsp; She enjoyed solitude as well, but got very little
of it living with three other roommates.&nbsp; "I like the way you decorated
the place.&nbsp; What made you choose a Greek theme?"
<p>"Well, I..." began Sarah, but the phone started ringing inside the house.&nbsp;
"Excuse me while I get that.&nbsp; In fact, Helen, as Nina won't be needing
her suit or her clothes while she's here, why don't you go pack them up
and put her bag back in your car."
<p>"Er, sure.&nbsp; If Nina doesn't mind," Helen said, looking at her friend.
<p>"I'm sure she won't mind," Sarah answered as she went inside.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "Helen, what the hell are you doing?"
<p>Helen giggled.&nbsp; "Oh come on, it was funny.&nbsp; I didn't know
you were actually going to strip, though.&nbsp; I thought it was all for
laughs!"
<p>"Well, as you can plainly see, it isn't; and now she's got you putting
my clothes out of reach."
<p>"It's just like over at Mr. Cook's, isn't it," Helen said.
<p>"Too much like it.&nbsp; Now I'm stuck here naked."
<p>"Well, why don't you just get dressed then?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina considered it, but shook her head.&nbsp; "I can't; I had better
not."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>Nina considered telling Helen about the threat Sarah had made to reveal
Nina's nude secret to the rest of the firm, but decided not to.&nbsp; "It's
complicated.&nbsp; Look, you'd better do as she says and take my clothes
away."
<p>"Are you sure?" Helen said, leaning forward and touching Nina's arm.
<p>The naked girl nodded.
<p>"Okay, I'll be right back."
<p>Nina didn't watch Helen scamper off.&nbsp; Instead, she looked at her
plate until Sarah returned.&nbsp; The lawyer watched Helen in her bikini
cross the courtyard with Nina's bag in her hands and enter the house.
<p>"A nice girl," Sarah said, "I was surprised when Brian told me that
she knew your little secret.&nbsp; But then I expect that you had to have
a friend, someone to confide in about your experiences."&nbsp; Sarah looked
directly at Nina.&nbsp; "Someone to share them with, perhaps?"
<p>Nina scowled.&nbsp; "She doesn't share anything; it's strictly me, Sarah!"
<p>Sarah shrugged.&nbsp; "Pity, we might have to see what we can do to
change that."
<p>"No!" Nina said firmly.
<p>Sarah just smiled.
<p>Helen came back out.&nbsp; "A truck just pulled up outside.&nbsp; Franklin's
driving."
<p>"That would be the files; about time, too!&nbsp; Come on, let's go unload,"
Sarah said, getting out of her chair.
<p>Nina actually stood up before realizing that she was about to be exposed
to someone else.&nbsp; "Wait, I can't go out there!"
<p>"Of course you can, Nina.&nbsp; It's only Franklin.&nbsp; He won't talk,"
Sarah said.
<p>"It's not his talking I'm worried about; it's his looking!"
<p>"Nina!&nbsp; We're not going to unload all those boxes by ourselves.&nbsp;
If we're to get this done, we need to pull together as a team.&nbsp; Now
stop bellyaching and come help!"
<p>Nina looked startled at her boss, and knew this to be another one of
those helpless moments.&nbsp; She nodded slowly and glanced at Helen, who
looked rather stricken herself.&nbsp; Nina was glad to see that Helen didn't
find all of this situation funny.
<p>Nina walked behind the two other women as best she could, but coming
out in front of the house there was no hiding from Franklin.&nbsp; The
creepy looking little man had walked around to the back of the truck and
had opened it up.&nbsp; He was just about to climb inside when he spotted
Nina and his jaw dropped.
<p>Nina started blushing again as she felt his watery eyes crawl up and
down her body, and she could swear she noticed a bulge appear in his pants
before she looked away in disgust.&nbsp; Even the college boys she met
on the beach last weekend hadn't looked at her with such obvious lust.&nbsp;
But Franklin let it all hang out.
<p>"Oh, put your tongue back in your mouth," said Sarah, actually smacking
him across the back of the head.&nbsp; "We have work to do; which boxes
first?"
<p>Franklin tore his eyes off Nina's body and turned to face his boss.&nbsp;
He gave her an appreciative once over as well before answering.&nbsp; "I
numbered all the boxes according to a general date, but just glancing through
some of them I saw that a lot of the files are mixed throughout.&nbsp;
I bet the assholes at Cronenberg shuffled them on purpose."
<p>"I wouldn't put it past their lawyers," Sarah agreed.&nbsp; She looked
inside the truck to see all the boxes stacked toward the front of the box.&nbsp;
Despite the early hour, the inside of the box was already hot.
<p>"Nina, hop up in there, will you," Sarah said.&nbsp; "You can pass the
boxes back while the three of us haul them inside.&nbsp; Okay?"
<p>"Sure, I can do that."&nbsp; Nina padded carefully over the gravel driveway
and climbed up into the truck.&nbsp; It occurred to her that as she did
so, she gave Franklin a close up and unobscured look at her ass and pussy,
and she blushed even more when she thought she heard him lick his lips.
<p>She tried to stand up, but the box was too short, making her bend over.&nbsp;
This made her breasts hang in front of her a little more, so she squatted
down.&nbsp; One look at Franklin and where he was looking now made Nina
think THAT was a bad idea as well.&nbsp; She turned, and grabbed a box.
<p>"Not that one, pull them by the numbers," Franklin said.
<p>Nina nodded, not trusting herself to speak, she was so embarrassed,
and found the right box to start with.&nbsp; Sarah took this one, a silent
and sorrowful Helen the next, and Franklin the third after letting his
fingers brush Nina's.&nbsp; He gave her a leer and a wink and carried the
box away.
<p>Nina sat down and sighed.
<p>Box after box was handed out, each one very heavy and awkward to carry
inside the truck box.&nbsp; The heat also made it difficult, and Nina was
soon sweating up a storm.&nbsp; Her skin looked slick, and Franklin loved
to watch her bend and shift, her athletic, well toned body a delight to
the eye.
<p>Nina tried not to look at him.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina sat at one of the tables, paging through file after file from the
box in front of her.&nbsp; After unloading the truck, Nina took advantage
of the courtyard swimming pool to loosen her overworked muscles and rinse
the sweat off herself.&nbsp; Her hair now lay in a wet mat down her back,
but she felt better.&nbsp; The only thing that marred her swim was Franklin
watching her as she climbed out, dripping water from every curve.&nbsp;
The leer he gave her made her stomach roll; he really was a repulsive man.&nbsp;
Now he was across the courtyard from her, indexing the files and trying
to get them in some sort of order, while Nina, Helen, and Sarah dove in
and tried to read them.
<p>Sarah had explained what she was looking for, and while the girls understood
what she wanted, their heart wasn't in it.&nbsp; Both of them felt for
the young girls at Cronenberg, and thought it horrible that their parents
were working to bring back their humiliating punishments, but only Helen
was foolish enough to voice her opinion.
<p>Sarah was quick with her reply.&nbsp; "If you think you're on the wrong
side of this argument," she said, "feel free to leave now and join the
opposition...permanently!"
<p>Nina was stunned, but Helen hadn't caught the venom in Sarah's words.
<p>"But you have to admit that it's a rather cruel thing to do, forcing
these teenage girls to walk around topless or bottomless, or even naked!"
Helen said.&nbsp; She waved around a few papers she had been reading.&nbsp;
"I mean look at this one!&nbsp; For talking back to a teacher, this girl
got her blouse taken away, and when she tried to explain herself the teacher
took her bra away too.&nbsp; She had to stay like that the rest of the
day!&nbsp; That's hardly fair, and I want to know, is it really effective?&nbsp;
It just seems cruel to me, not a valid form of discipline at all!"
<p>"You think that, do you?" Sarah said, standing up and walking over to
her.&nbsp; Nina watched quietly from her own table.
<p>"Yes I do.&nbsp; Embarrassing though it must be, it's hardly a way to
instill proper values in a young girl, and I doubt she learns a lesson
that other methods couldn't teach better."
<p>Sarah looked at her for a moment, then held out her hand.&nbsp; "Give
me your bikini top," she said.
<p>"What?" Helen asked, going from concerned know-it-all to scared in the
blink of an eye.
<p>"I said, give me your top!"
<p>"Why?"
<p>"Because I want you to feel what they feel, only then perhaps will you
be able to tell me if Cronenberg's rules of discipline are effective or
not.&nbsp; I think you should spend the weekend under the same rules, just
to live in their shoes for a while.&nbsp; Now give it to me."
<p>"I can't do that," whispered Helen, going pale and glancing at Franklin,
who was also watching from across the pool.
<p>"Well, like I said, you can always leave and join the opposition.&nbsp;
It's your choice.&nbsp; But while you're here, you're going to be a part
of THIS team, which means knowing that what we are fighting for in this
suit is what is best for those girls.&nbsp; And it seems to me that the
only way to convince you is to have you experience it for yourself.&nbsp;
But as I said, it's your choice."
<p>Helen stared at Sarah, who stared back at her with her arm outstretched.&nbsp;
Helen swallowed and glanced at Nina who didn't move.
<p>"I...can't afford to leave the firm," Helen said.
<p>"Then you know what you have to do, Helen," Sarah said slowly.
<p>Helen flushed, and she reached behind to undo the catch of her bikini
top.&nbsp; She gathered it up in one hand while shielding her breasts with
the other arm, a deep red flush flowing through her.
<p>Sarah took the top away from her.&nbsp; "You'll get this back at lunch,
if you're good."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," said Helen, head low.
<p>Sarah started to walk away, then stopped and turned.&nbsp; Nina saw
a glint in her eye.&nbsp; "One more thing.&nbsp; Cronenberg rules state
you can't cover up anything exposed, so sitting there with your arm across
yourself is a big violation worthy of more stripping."&nbsp; Sarah let
that comment hang in the air for a minute, while Helen considered it and
caught its meaning.
<p>She slowly moved her arm away until she sat up straight, uncovered,
her breasts on display to the courtyard.
<p>Franklin gave a whistle of appreciation, which almost made Helen cover
up again, but she held fast while Sarah glared at him.
<p>The lawyer went back to her seat, and the three women slowly got back
to work.
<p>Franklin stood watching for a few minutes; the naked back of Nina, the
wonderful breasts of Helen, the supple figure of his boss, and thought
himself a very lucky man.
<p>It took another glare from Sarah to get him working again.
<p>---***---
<p>Helen didn't get her top back at lunchtime.&nbsp; Sarah caught her hiding
behind her paperwork, lifting it up so Franklin couldn't see her breasts.
<p>"What did I tell you about covering yourself up, Helen?" Sarah said
loudly so that all could hear.
<p>Helen jumped and flushed with either anger or embarrassment, Nina couldn't
tell.&nbsp; But Helen slowly laid the file she was reading down flat on
the table.
<p>"You get your top back at supper," Sarah said, going back to her work.
<p>"But..." Helen began.
<p>"Bed time!" Sarah snapped.
<p>Helen opened her mouth, as if to protest further and Sarah looked up.&nbsp;
"Would you like me to include your bottoms as well, Helen?" Sarah said
sweetly.
<p>Helen paled and looked over at Franklin, who was enjoying the young
woman's discomfort immensely.&nbsp; Helen shook her head.
<p>Sarah went back to her work, and the group kept on going.
<p>They worked through lunch, and Nina was volunteered by Sarah to go make
sandwiches for everyone.&nbsp; On one hand Nina was happy to go inside
and out of sight of Franklin for a while, but on the other it was worse
for her as she had to walk around giving everyone their food, which meant
showing herself off in front of Franklin even more.
<p>Eventually though, the creepy little man finished indexing and sorting
all the files, and now they were all in an order to make life easier for
the women.
<p>"Thank you, Franklin," Sarah said, barely looking up at him.&nbsp; "I'll
call you Sunday so we can prepare for trial."
<p>"Sure thing, Sarah," he replied, his eyes only on the breasts of both
Nina and Helen.&nbsp; "I can stay if you like, pull files and stuff for
you."
<p>Sarah looked over at Nina and Helen, smiling inwardly at how uncomfortable
the younger women were with the idea that he might stay longer.&nbsp; But
she figured they had suffered enough.&nbsp; "No, Franklin, that's fine.&nbsp;
Go home!"
<p>You could tell Franklin was disappointed, but he left anyway, and once
he was gone the tension lifted somewhat.
<p>"Ma'am," Nina said shortly after he left, "Can I ask a question?"
<p>"Yes, Nina, of course," Sarah replied.
<p>"Franklin.&nbsp; Can we trust him not to...well, talk?"
<p>Sarah looked up.&nbsp; "Nina, I wouldn't have allowed him to see you
like this if I thought he would talk.&nbsp; Don't worry about him blabbing,
he has good reason not to betray me."
<p>"Good," Helen said from her table.
<p>Sarah looked over at her.&nbsp; "You think me an ogre, Helen?&nbsp;
What is it they call me, the Legallady?"
<p>Helen just looked at her, too scared to say anything.
<p>Sarah chuckled.&nbsp; "I'm not as bad as you think I am, Dear.&nbsp;
I just wanted to show you how effective Cronenberg discipline can really
be.&nbsp; You know that now, don't you?"
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Helen replied.
<p>Sarah smiled.
<p>"Does this mean I can get dressed again, Ma'am?" Helen asked.
<p>Sarah chuckled.&nbsp; "There's no reduction in punishment at Cronenberg,
even after a lesson is learned.&nbsp; Tell you what, though, we've all
put in a lot of work today.&nbsp; Another hour, and I'll buy us all dinner,
how about it?"
<p>Nina and Helen agreed, and the women bent once more to their task, a
little happier now.
<p>They had gotten a lot done.&nbsp; The indexing had helped, and now certain
threads were being followed with ease.&nbsp; When Sarah finally called
a halt to the day, she knew she had the makings of a good case in her hands.
<p>"Have a swim, relax," she said to her two young paralegals, "I'll make
dinner arrangements."
<p>Nina and Helen got up, and Nina stretched, tired after spending the
day in the same chair.&nbsp; She eyed the cool water of the pool and thought
seriously about another dip.
<p>Helen watched her friend slowly limber up, and again admired the nude's
supple body.&nbsp; She sighed.&nbsp; "I need a drink, you need anything?"
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "I'm just going to jump in the water for
a little bit."&nbsp; Nina looked at Helen, still self-consciously hiding
her breasts and struggling not to.&nbsp; Nina knew how she felt, but had
gotten used to her nudity here after a full day of it.&nbsp; Franklin leaving
had been a big help.&nbsp; "It'll be okay, Helen, you'll see," she said.
<p>"Let's not talk about it now, okay?" Helen said, clearly embarrassed.
<p>Nina nodded and headed for the pool.
<p>When Sarah came back out of the house, now fully dressed in a light
pleated skirt and matching blouse, she found Nina swimming as usual and
Helen laying back on a sun bed.&nbsp; Sarah knew Helen was still nervous
about being topless, and wondered how she would react to her latest ploy.&nbsp;
The Legallady wasn't a sadist, but she had played these types of games
most of her life it seemed, and she wondered how both younger women would
react if they knew certain truths about her.
<p>Sarah Wickland put those thoughts aside for a later time and made her
announcement.
<p>"You both did very well today, we got a lot accomplished.&nbsp; I know
we have a chance at beating our opponent in court now!"
<p>"Thanks, Sarah," Nina said from the water, much more relaxed now.
<p>"Well, I'm in the mood to celebrate," Sarah said with a smile.&nbsp;
"Helen, why don't you run and put on a skirt, and we'll be off!"
<p>Both young women looked up, stunned.
<p>"We're going out?" Nina asked.
<p>"You mean a dress, right?" Helen said at the same time.
<p>"Yes we're going out, and I meant a skirt, not a dress."
<p>"But I can't go out like this!" Helen said, panicking once more.
<p>"Helen, you're fine.&nbsp; You don't have to worry," Sarah said.
<p>"But I'm topless!" Helen almost screamed.
<p>"And I'm naked," Nina added, climbing out of the water.&nbsp; "You can't
take us out like this, Sarah.&nbsp; Be reasonable.&nbsp; We're playing
your little game here, but out there is the real world.&nbsp; We're going
to get arrested!"&nbsp; Nina was also close to panic, wondering if she
would actually go to a public restaurant if Sarah insisted that she do
so.
<p>"Nina, Helen, it's okay," Sarah said, trying to calm both women down.&nbsp;
"Where I'm taking us out to dinner, they won't care how you're dressed,
or even IF you're dressed..."
<p>"Where's that, some strip club?" Helen said, standing up and crossing
her arms over her chest.&nbsp; "They may not care, but I do!"
<p>"No, it's not a strip club.&nbsp; If you must know, I'm taking you to
the Valley Palms, at the Buffalo Resort."
<p>"Valley Palms?" Nina asked confused, but Helen caught it.
<p>"You're talking about the nudist resort, right?" she said.
<p>"Yes, and no doubt half the people there will be as under dressed as
the two of you.&nbsp; Now come on, our table will be ready in just half
an hour."
<p>Sarah held out her hand, and both Helen and Nina stared at it.&nbsp;
Nina finally looked over at Helen, not believing the thoughts going through
her head.
<p>"It'll be just like that time we went to the beach," Nina said.
<p>Helen looked at her, wild-eyed.&nbsp; "Are you saying we should go?&nbsp;
Like this?"
<p>Nina inclined her head.&nbsp; "I will if you will; I'm game."&nbsp;
She took a deep breath, not believing she was actually considering going
to a restaurant completely naked, yet thrilled by the idea at the same
time.
<p>Helen swallowed.&nbsp; One thing she admired about her friend was her
courage, the way she carried herself even when naked.&nbsp; Now her friend
said she was ready to out to a restaurant just the way she was, and even
though it was a place well used to dealing with nudity, it was still a
daunting prospect.&nbsp; Yet...there were many times when Helen wished
she had Nina's courage, and found the idea of failing in front of her almost
as scary as being seen topless.
<p>Almost.
<p>Sarah watched both girls as they made up their minds.&nbsp; She figured
she had applied enough pressure; it was all up to them.
<p>Helen closed her eyes and nodded.
<p>"Very good.&nbsp; Then off you go, Helen; get that skirt on.&nbsp; You
can meet Nina and me out front."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am."
<p>Nina followed Sarah out to her car, butterflies in her stomach.&nbsp;
She wished she had at least something to wear out to the restaurant, but
knew Sarah wouldn't hear of it.&nbsp; She was glad at least that Sarah's
Mercedes wasn't a convertible.
<p>Climbing in and placing her bare skin against the warm leather, Nina
decided to ask her boss a question.&nbsp; "Why are you doing this, Ma'am?"
<p>"Doing what?" Sarah said, buckling her seat belt.
<p>"Why did you make Helen take her top off?&nbsp; Why are you forcing
us to expose ourselves to strangers?&nbsp; Why do you want me naked all
the time?"
<p>"Those are big questions," Sarah remarked, looking over at Nina.
<p>"I hope they have big answers," Nina replied.
<p>Sarah smiled, but didn't answer.&nbsp; A moment later Helen got in the
car, looking odd in a floor length skirt and no top.&nbsp; She sat with
her arms across her chest.
<p>Sarah looked at her.&nbsp; "What did I say about covering up?"
<p>Helen opened her mouth in shock.&nbsp; "But...I thought..."
<p>"We're not done yet.&nbsp; You're now topless the rest of the weekend.&nbsp;
Want to go for the bottoms?"
<p>Helen flushed and moved her arms.
<p>---***---
<p>The Buffalo Nudist Resort was a public resort, although by unspoken
agreement it was a rather exclusive public resort.&nbsp; It was nestled
at the upper end of the Buffalo Valley, from which it took its name, and
commanded a wide view of the surrounding countryside all the way down to
the ocean two miles away.&nbsp; Strategic placement and a few shady land
buys assured the place no overlooks, so its patrons were guaranteed their
privacy to cavort with nature 'au natural'.&nbsp; All the public got to
see, those that weren't brave enough to accept the "Required Nudity" law
of the club, was the administration building, the gift shop, and the four
star restaurant.&nbsp; Buffalo Nudist Resort was no campground on land
nobody else wanted, it was a full service resort with everything including
on-site massage therapists.&nbsp; It even had a beach that surrounded its
own lake.&nbsp; The place exuded money.
<p>This was fairly obvious to Nina and Helen as Sarah drove into the parking
lot.&nbsp; Bentley, Rolls, Cadillac... the lot looked like a car salesman's
dream.&nbsp; The mere prosperity of what they were seeing made Nina and
Helen nervous.
<p>Sarah Wickland pulled into a parking space a fair distance from the
restaurant, and Nina wondered why Sarah hadn't at least TRIED to look for
something closer.&nbsp; But it was obvious to her now that her boss got
some sort of thrill from exposing her, and Nina was sad that now Helen
was a part of things too.
<p>"I can't go out there!" Helen said with a scared look.&nbsp; The young
woman was gripping her seat with both hands to stop herself from covering
up.
<p>"Yes, you can, Helen," Sarah replied, gathering up her handbag.&nbsp;
"You'll be fine, won't she, Nina?"
<p>Nina tried to smile, and she took one of Helen's hands.&nbsp; "You'll
be okay," she said.&nbsp; "It'll be me everyone will be looking at, not
you.&nbsp; At least you get to wear your skirt!"
<p>Helen didn't look comforted, but she gave Nina a small smile.&nbsp;
"You're so brave, I don't know how you do this."
<p>"No one is going to be looking.&nbsp; This is a nudist resort; everyone
is used to naked people here, they think nothing of it.&nbsp; Now come
on!"&nbsp; Sarah opened her door and climbed out.
<p>Nina bit back a remark and opened her door.&nbsp; She took a deep breath
and stepped out.&nbsp; Standing naked next to the car, she took a cautious
look around and saw several people heading either to or from the restaurant.&nbsp;
All were dressed, to Nina's dismay.
<p>Helen got out after her, and while she was able to keep her hands down,
she never-the-less stood behind Nina.
<p>Sarah locked the car, the beep of its alarm making both girls jump,
and she started walking to the restaurant without a backward glance.
<p>Both Nina and Helen knew they were stuck; unable to get back in the
car, they either had to follow Sarah or wander around out here for a while.&nbsp;
Neither prospect appealed to them, but they ended up following their boss
anyway.
<p>To Nina, it was just like the first time she approached Diotelli's grocery
store.&nbsp; The people coming in and out, all looking at her; not with
horror at her nakedness, but with a casual interest.&nbsp; One or two raised
their eyebrows, but a few also mumbled greetings as they passed.&nbsp;
The entire atmosphere felt odd to Nina; she was not yet used to the acceptance
that fellow nudists gave each other.
<p>Helen was just scared, and shied away from any contact with anyone.&nbsp;
Blushing furiously and wondering if her job was really worth the humiliation,
she could only try to avoid being looked at directly.&nbsp; The only thing
that kept her going was Nina.&nbsp; Helen figured that if her friend could
do this completely naked, then she should be able to handle it topless.
<p>They entered the restaurant, and first timers Nina and Helen were immediately
impressed with the quality of the interior.
<p>It reminded Nina of the movie "Titanic," the grand dining room with
all its splendor.&nbsp; It was bigger than she expected, and mostly filled
from what she could see.&nbsp; At least a hundred people she thought.
<p>Just inside the lobby was the maitre d'.&nbsp; He was dressed in a silk
suit as befitted his station, and he raised an eyebrow when Nina and Helen
stepped inside.&nbsp; But he was a professional and didn't let his eyes
linger.&nbsp; Besides, it wasn't the first time someone had dined there
nude, although it was unusual.&nbsp; What Sarah had...neglected...to tell
the young women was, while the restaurant was an official part of the resort,
it was unofficially expected that its patrons would dress for dinner.&nbsp;
This was because the restaurant was also open to the public.&nbsp; There
was no rule stating that you HAD to dress, but it was suggested that you
do.&nbsp; Nina and Helen didn't know it, but the crowd that night was a
mix of resort regulars and members of the general public who just wanted
to eat in a high-class restaurant.
<p>If they HAD known, they could have told who was who simply from the
reactions of those they passed as they were led to their table.&nbsp; The
nudists either ignored them or smiled in an amused manner at their foolishness.&nbsp;
The public either stared at them in shock, or in many cases in lust.
<p>Both Nina and Helen noticed some of the looks, but their attention was
taken by where they were going.&nbsp; The maitre d' was leading them to
a table almost in the middle of the restaurant.
<p>"Oh, can't we get a booth?" Helen said desperately.
<p>The maitre d' raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "There are no...booths...here,
Madam."
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "This table will do fine, John.&nbsp; Thank you."
<p>John bowed slightly and left the ladies alone in the middle of the room
while they seated themselves.&nbsp; Nina and Helen both looked for a seat
that would grant them the least exposure, but there was none, so they just
sat.&nbsp; Helen held her head in her hands, but Nina was somewhat glad
that the tablecloths were long enough to cover her up from the waist down.
<p>A waiter appeared in a moment, bearing menus and taking drink orders.&nbsp;
Helen ordered something rather strong, as did Sarah, surprisingly enough.&nbsp;
Nina, never a heavy drinker, kept her drink order soft.
<p>"You okay, Helen?" Sarah asked, noting the woman's distress.
<p>Helen took a deep breath, her breasts rising and falling, before nodding
and sitting back.&nbsp; "It's just a bit...overwhelming, that's all."
<p>"You'll be fine.&nbsp; Now, order anything you want, my treat!"
<p>Nina was glad Sarah was buying; the prices matched the quality of the
room.&nbsp; But the selection looked wonderful, so she decided to splurge.
<p>While they waited for their food, Nina took a careful look around the
room, searching for anyone who was at least topless as Helen was.&nbsp;
But it seemed that everyone was dressed, and most in his or her Sunday
best!&nbsp; Nina felt awkward and out of place being the only naked person
in a room full of strangers, and she wondered what chain of events had
brought her to this position.&nbsp; With a little grin, she thought about
Brian, and how he had gotten her to stay naked all the time at home so
he could study her embarrassment for his artwork.&nbsp; Nina thought he
should have come on THIS trip; there was enough embarrassment between her
and Helen to make several statues!
<p>But as time went on, she found herself growing used to her nudity again,
as long as she didn't look at some of the folk around her.&nbsp; She was
puzzled as to why a few couldn't take their eyes off her, while others
acted like they saw naked women eating in restaurants all the time.&nbsp;
A few smiled at her, and Nina made half hearted attempts to smile back,
but some, mostly men but some women too, openly leered at her.&nbsp; This
made Nina uncomfortable, and she did her best to avoid their eyes.&nbsp;
But throughout the entire meal, she could always feel them watching her,
their eyes on the bare skin she could not cover.
<p>She traded looks with Helen from time to time, and could see that her
friend was suffering from the same thing, although the drinks she was sucking
down did seem to relax her.&nbsp; Finishing her second, Helen's face was
now flushed from more than embarrassment.&nbsp; Nina noticed that Helen's
breasts and upper chest were also slightly redder than normal.&nbsp; Her
nipples stood out too, something Nina hadn't noticed before.&nbsp; Nina
wondered if it was the drink.
<p>But the food was very good, and Sarah kept the conversation light and
off business.&nbsp; She asked both girls about their upbringing and why
they had come out here to work for the firm.&nbsp; She offered little of
her own past though, and was adept at turning the conversation back around
to either young woman.&nbsp; Sarah didn't seem as affected by her alcoholic
consumption either, although she matched Helen drink for drink.
<p>Helen was feeling no pain.&nbsp; Normally a light drinker herself, she
had been scared enough to take refuge in alcohol.&nbsp; Now she felt a
lot calmer, somewhat numb in her face and body, and a lot more in control.&nbsp;
When she thought Nina wasn't looking, Helen would glance over at her friend,
admiring how she handled being naked in front of all these people so easily.&nbsp;
Helen felt weak having to drink her courage from a glass.
<p>Eventually, after a dangerous fight with the restaurant's specialty
cheesecake, which all three women lost, the meal ended and they began to
make their way out.
<p>Nina was glad to be out of there, but was concerned for her friend.&nbsp;
Helen had gone quite pale once she stood, and while she was able to walk
by herself, she didn't look at all well.
<p>Sarah noticed this as well, and took charge, steering the topless girl
into the ladies room rather than out the front door.&nbsp; It was a good
thing she did, for no sooner had they entered than Helen pulled away and
dove for a stall.&nbsp; Her expensive meal, and the drinks that had accompanied
it, all came back to rejoin the world.
<p>Nina immediately got on her knees to help Helen out as the sick young
women knelt before the toilet, while Sarah stood in the background and
watched, a concerned look on her face.
<p>"She's not a drinker, is she?" Sarah stated at one point.
<p>Nina shook her head and supported her friend, whispering quietly to
her.&nbsp; Nina was used to dealing with drunks; one thing she hadn't talked
about at dinner was how her father was an alcoholic.
<p>Helen eventually knelt back, her face less pale.&nbsp; She looked better
for throwing up, and Sarah knew she probably felt a lot better as well.
<p>"How are you doing, Helen?" Sarah asked.
<p>Helen took a deep breath before answering.&nbsp; "Better, a lot better.&nbsp;
Still rather dizzy, though."
<p>"It's okay, Helen; you're just drunk," Nina said.&nbsp; "You'll be fine
once we get you home."
<p>Sarah echoed the sentiment and she helped Nina get the girl to her feet.&nbsp;
She was a mess, not quite making the bowl the first time.&nbsp; Vomit was
on her face and drops decorated her bare chest.&nbsp; But her skirt had
taken the brunt of the damage.&nbsp; She had knelt down in the mess she
had made on the floor, and leaning against the bowl at one point, had covered
her lap as well.
<p>"Nina, wet down a couple of towels; let's get her cleaned up," Sarah
ordered.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Nina said, wanting to help.
<p>"Then go tell the maitre d' what happened here so he can have someone
clean up."
<p>Nina nodded and got to work.
<p>Helen started fussing when Sarah began undoing the catch on the side
of her skirt.&nbsp; "What are you doing?" she asked.
<p>"You're skirt is a mess, girl.&nbsp; You can't go out there like this.&nbsp;
We have to clean you up!" Sarah replied.
<p>"But this is all I have to wear!" Helen said, but she had to admit her
skirt was a total loss.&nbsp; She could feel that it was soaked through,
and the smell wasn't helping her stomach any.
<p>Nina brought over some towels she had wetted down and left quietly on
her next errand.&nbsp; She blushed again as she stood out in the lobby,
enduring looks from nearby people as she waited for the maitre d' to come
back from inside the restaurant.&nbsp; When he did return, she told him
what happened, and almost ran back to the ladies room.
<p>Inside she was shocked to see Helen standing naked, her skirt and panties
a puddle on the floor beside her.&nbsp; Helen was blushing beet red and
rubbing herself down with a towel while Sarah stood in front of a sink
rinsing another one out.
<p>Sarah looked up as Nina came in.&nbsp; "It had soaked her through to
the skin; she couldn't wear anything."
<p>Helen looked up, scared.&nbsp; "Nina, please tell me I don't have to
go out there like this?"
<p>"Your clothes are a mess, Helen.&nbsp; You can't put them back on,"
Sarah said angrily.&nbsp; "Tell her, will you, Nina?"
<p>Nina looked at the small pile of clothing.&nbsp; She knew that SHE wouldn't
want to put them on.&nbsp; "It'll be okay, Helen.&nbsp; If you HAVE to
go naked some place, a nudist resort is as good a place as any.&nbsp; All
you have to do is get from here to the car.&nbsp; It'll be okay."
<p>"You sure?" Helen said, wanting to trust her friend.
<p>Nina careful stepped forward and took Helen's hand.&nbsp; "I'm sure,"
she said with a smile.&nbsp; Nina knew that Helen was far from sober, but
she seemed to be in control, which helped.
<p>Helen nodded and finished wiping herself down.
<p>Things were just coming under control when there was a knock at the
door and it burst open.&nbsp; A man in a maintenance uniform walked in
and stopped dead when he saw the two naked women.&nbsp; He blushed bright
red as Helen shrieked.
<p>"Sorry, I thought you were gone!" he said as he backed right out of
the room.
<p>Sarah smiled and started to chuckle.&nbsp; "Did you see the look on
his face?"
<p>Helen and Nina, both scared witless by the sudden encounter, stared
at her.&nbsp; Then suddenly Helen started to giggle as well.&nbsp; "Yeah,
it was pretty funny."
<p>Nina just shook her head.&nbsp; "Can we get out of here now?"
<p>Sarah agreed that it was time to go.&nbsp; "Come on!"
<p>They left the ruined clothing behind, and as a threesome stepped out
into the lobby.&nbsp; People stared at the two nude young women, but no
one stopped them as they exited the restaurant.&nbsp; Helen was beginning
to really feel her drinks now and had problems walking.&nbsp; So Sarah
ordered both girls to stand outside the entrance while she went for the
car.
<p>Of course, this only added to their exposure; two nude, well-built young
women drew a lot of attention.&nbsp; But only minutes later Sarah pulled
up in her Mercedes, and Helen and Nina were able to jump in the back.
<p>It had been quite a dinner.
<p>---***---
<p>"Oh, my head."&nbsp; Those were the first words out of Helen early the
next morning.
<p>Nina was already awake, lying in her bed, and pushed back her thoughts
as she got up and went to help her friend.&nbsp; She picked up a couple
of Tylenol and a glass of water she had ready, and helped Helen drink them
down.
<p>"Thanks," whispered Helen, "I feel like hell."
<p>"Don't worry, it'll pass," Nina said with a smile.
<p>"God, I hope so.&nbsp; I have NEVER been that drunk."
<p>Nina chuckled.&nbsp; "I hope you never are again."
<p>"Count on it."&nbsp; Helen sighed and opened her eyes.&nbsp; Her first
sight was of Nina, still naked, sitting on the side of the bed and leaning
over her.&nbsp; Helen's second sight was of her own nude body stretched
out in front of her.&nbsp; She started blushing immediately and moved to
cover up, but felt heavy and old.
<p>"Ugh," she said.&nbsp; "Can I get something to wear?" she asked.
<p>Nina dodged the question.&nbsp; Instead, she stood up and put the empty
water glass on a table.&nbsp; "When you're feeling a little better, come
on out and get in the water.&nbsp; Believe me, floating in a pool is a
good pain reliever."
<p>"Sure," Helen said, trying not to nod.&nbsp; "Did we...did I really
walk naked through a restaurant last night?"
<p>Nina paused at the door.&nbsp; "Well, only through the lobby, but yes,
you did."
<p>"Oh man."
<p>Nina looked at her friend for a moment, a sad expression on her face,
and then left the room.&nbsp; She walked out into the cool of the morning
and dove cleanly into the water.&nbsp; The pool was too small for her to
get her usual vigorous work out, but just being in the water was calming
to her.&nbsp; It was the only place where Nina felt really good about being
nude, floating weightless.&nbsp; It was the only time not having clothing
made her feel free rather than boxed in.&nbsp; She wondered what she would
do if she couldn't swim.
<p>Presently, as Nina expected, Helen appeared at the door to their room.&nbsp;
At least her head did; the rest of her hidden behind the doorway.
<p>"Nina!" Helen whispered loudly.&nbsp; She waved frantically for her
friend to come over.
<p>Nina bit her lip and swam to that side of the pool.&nbsp; She didn't
come out, though; instead she just propped herself up on her arms, showing
just her head and shoulders above the level of the deck.
<p>"Nina!" Helen whispered again, looking around to see if Sarah was awake
this early in the morning.
<p>"I'm here," Nina replied.
<p>"Where are my clothes?&nbsp; My bag is gone!"
<p>Nina took a deep breath.&nbsp; She had hoped that Sarah would be the
one to break the news to her; Nina didn't like doing her boss's dirty work
for her.&nbsp; "They're in your car."
<p>"What?"
<p>"They're in your car, everything you brought, just like all my stuff
is."
<p>"Why?&nbsp; I'm just supposed to be topless, not naked!"
<p>Nina sighed again.&nbsp; "It's Sarah's doing.&nbsp; She told me that
since you're under Cronenberg rules this weekend, you have to suffer all
of them."
<p>"I'm really beginning to hate that school, but what has that got to
do with my clothes being taken away from me?"
<p>"You messed up your skirt and underwear last night.&nbsp; The rules
state you lose anything you mess up, so Sarah said that you lose the right
to wear anything below the waist the rest of the weekend.&nbsp; I guess
that means now you go naked...just like me."
<p>Helen swallowed.&nbsp; "I can't," she said, her voice breaking.
<p>Nina quickly climbed out and padded wet and nude over to her friend.&nbsp;
She took her and gave her a hug for comfort, knowing it was hard on Helen
to hear this.
<p>"It's okay, it's going to be okay.&nbsp; You'll be fine.&nbsp; It's
really not that bad.&nbsp; It's just for today."
<p>"I can't go out there naked; what if she gets the idea to humiliate
us someplace else!" Helen said, wrapping her own arms around Nina and holding
on.
<p>"She won't.&nbsp; I made her promise last night not to humiliate you
further.&nbsp; You'll have to work here naked today, but that's it.&nbsp;
No trips, no one coming over.&nbsp; It's just going to be the three of
us.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; You can handle that, can't you?"
<p>Helen sniffed.&nbsp; "Just us?&nbsp; Yeah...I can handle that."
<p>"You'll be fine," Nina said, smiling.
<p>Helen nodded, and Nina suddenly became more aware of the woman she was
holding.&nbsp; A part of her actually enjoyed the hug, the skin to skin
contact of another person.&nbsp; It had been a long time for Nina since
she had indulged in such pleasures.&nbsp; But the fact that it was a friend,
and another woman to boot, soured the experience for her a little, and
she reluctantly broke free.
<p>Helen didn't want to let go at first.&nbsp; She too was enjoying the
contact; her friend's warm yet wet flesh meeting hers.&nbsp; The firmness
of her muscles, the way she smelled.&nbsp; Helen drew strength from all
this and felt...close to Nina.&nbsp; But she let go, and the two women
stood facing each other, both flushing a little from the contact, but for
slightly different reasons.
<p>"You okay?" Nina said to her.
<p>Helen nodded, then winced.&nbsp; "Yeah, except for my head, and my throat
is still sore, and I really need to brush my teeth."
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "I'll meet you in the pool; go clean yourself up."
<p>---***---
<p>The sun was higher in the sky when Sarah Wickland finally emerged from
her room in one corner of the courtyard.
<p>Nina and Helen were both still in the pool, half floating in one corner
as they talked.&nbsp; They watched slack jawed as their boss walked from
her room to the bathroom, for the older woman was completely naked.
<p>"Hello ladies," she said with a smile, looking totally at ease with
her nudity.&nbsp; She went into the bathroom and closed the door.
<p>Nina and Helen didn't know what to say; it wasn't what they had expected
at all.&nbsp; They stayed mute until a few minutes later Sarah came back
out.&nbsp; They watched as Sarah slipped into the pool and swum toward
them.
<p>"How are you feeling, Helen?" Sarah asked, a concerned look on her face.
<p>"Er...better now, well, better than I was.&nbsp; Nina gave me some pills
and the headache is going away.&nbsp; I'm sorry I got so drunk last night."
<p>"It's perfectly understandable.&nbsp; I did...push you...a little hard
last night.&nbsp; Nina convinced me to let up a little on you today," she
said with a glance at Nina.
<p>In fact, while Helen lay sleeping off her drunk.&nbsp; Nina and Sarah
almost got into a shouting match over Helen.&nbsp; Nina had been appalled
by what Helen had felt she needed to do to handle what was being done to
her, and Sarah in her own way was a little upset by the same thing.&nbsp;
Her virtually harmless bit of fun hadn't turned out to be much fun after
all.&nbsp; But Sarah was not a person to back down that easily, and it
was only after certain concessions were promised by her new paralegal that
Sarah agreed to turn down the pressure on Helen.&nbsp; Sarah had been adamant
about Helen staying under Cronenberg rules the rest of the day, but there
would be no other surprises for her.
<p>"Ma'am," said Helen, "do I really need to stay naked the rest of the
day?"
<p>Sarah nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, Helen, just so you get the complete picture
about life in Cronenberg.&nbsp; But to make things easier on both of you,
I'm going to spend the day nude as well.&nbsp; Okay?"
<p>Strangely enough it was.&nbsp; Both Helen and Nina felt better about
their boss being as nude as they were.&nbsp; Some how, it didn't seem as
hard to be naked if everybody else was too.
<p>"Well then.&nbsp; Let's get some breakfast together and attack those
files.&nbsp; We have a lot of work to get done today, and I KNOW you don't
want me to call Franklin back to help us," Sarah said with a grin.
<p>Both girls shouted "NO!" and the tension eased; the three of them climbed
out to find something to eat.
<p>---***---
<p>It was not long after lunch when the swearing started.&nbsp; Up until
then, the three legal professionals had been working smoothly together
on the boxes of files, sorting through them for the information Sarah needed
to win her case.&nbsp; Because of Franklin's index, the job was fairly
easy, and all three women were confident that the bulk of the work would
be done before supper.&nbsp; But as time went on, Sarah, who was coordinating
the separate bits of information the girls were feeding her, began frowning
more and more.
<p>She began digging in the boxes after their working lunch, pulling files
they had already gone through.&nbsp; Towards the end, she was scattering
paper everywhere, and Nina and Helen watched their nude boss get angrier
and angrier.
<p>It was when she got on her cell phone that they discovered the reason
why.
<p>"God dammit, Franklin, answer your phone!&nbsp; Franklin?&nbsp; This
is Sarah...yeah, hi.&nbsp; Look, was this everything Morgenstern sent us?&nbsp;
Yeah, I'm talking about the files.&nbsp; Is this everything?&nbsp; Nothing
got left behind at the office?&nbsp; Are you sure?&nbsp; Well, when you
went through them, did you find any personal statements from the students
filed in the wrong places?&nbsp; Yeah I know the files were a mess, you
didn't really think that asshole would make it easy on us, did you?&nbsp;
Yeah I know.&nbsp; That dickhead is going to get a call from me AND the
Judge.&nbsp; He can't be dicking around with files...Yeah, see you tomorrow,
bright and early!"
<p>She hung up and dialed again, this time looking at her paralegals, who
sat quietly and watched.&nbsp; Sarah mouthed the word "asshole" and pointed
at the phone.&nbsp; Then someone on the other end answered.&nbsp; "Sarah
Wickland for Frank Morgenstern please...&nbsp; Don't give me that, I know
he's there.&nbsp; Where else would he be the weekend before trial?&nbsp;
...if you don't put me ...would he like me to come down and yell at him
in person, because I'd like that, the long drive would give me time to
get REAL worked up!&nbsp; I thought not, now put me through to Morgenstern.
<p>"Morgenstern, you officious prick! You shafted me...&nbsp; You KNOW
what I'm talking about, you asshole, don't play innocent with me...&nbsp;
Yeah this IS for real, so will the call I make to the Judge in a few minutes
telling him you've been withholding evidence...&nbsp; Yeah I knew that
would get your attention...&nbsp; Student personal statements, about half
are missing.&nbsp; You didn't think we'd notice that did you?&nbsp; ...Well,
hell yeah, I want them!&nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp; Okay, you call the
school right now and have them pull those files.&nbsp; I'll have someone
over there in an hour...&nbsp; Yes, an hour, and God help you, Frank, if
they aren't ready... Yes, you have a nice day too, asshole!"
<p>Sarah almost broke the phone hitting the off button, but she grinned
broadly at Nina and Helen while she dialed another number.&nbsp; "I love
yelling at him, he's such a prick!"&nbsp; She put the phone to her ear,
and a moment later it was answered.
<p>"Jacob?&nbsp; Hi, it's Sarah...&nbsp; Yeah, things are going fine, we
should be in good shape for Monday, but I told you Morgenstern wouldn't
come completely clean...&nbsp; Yeah he tried to pull a fast one on us,
some files weren't here.&nbsp; I'm sending a girl to go get them now...&nbsp;
No, you don't have to go down there, I put the fear of God into the prick;
he'll have the files ready...&nbsp; I love you too...&nbsp; Bye!"
<p>Sarah hung up, took a deep breath, and sighed.
<p>"What's wrong exactly?" Nina asked.
<p>"We're missing an entire series of student remarks.&nbsp; Our opponent
says it must have been a mistake in shipping, but you can't trust him.&nbsp;
Nina, I need you to drive out to Cronenberg to fetch the files."
<p>Nina's eyes opened wide.&nbsp; "What, like this?"
<p>Sarah looked at her like she was actually considering it, then she smiled
and shook her head.&nbsp; "It's tempting, but you had better not.&nbsp;
Run out to your car, bring the bags in and get something on, the keys are
hanging by the front door.&nbsp; I'll have directions written out for you
by the time you come back in."
<p>Nina sighed in relief and hurried out to get dressed.&nbsp; As always,
it felt odd putting on clothes after so long naked, but it also felt comforting,
even though all she chose to wear was a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, with
panties and a bra of course.
<p>Coming back in the house, Nina felt doubly weird to be the only clothed
person there, and she noticed Helen staring hungrily at her clothing.&nbsp;
Nina winked and Helen smiled back.
<p>"Here, you go," Sarah said, handing her a piece of paper.&nbsp; "It
should take you an hour to get there, so if those files aren't ready, give
me a call and I'll call the Judge.&nbsp; You do NOT come back here without
those files, no matter what they try to do to stall you or make you leave.&nbsp;
You got that? Now get going!"
<p>"Yes Ma'am!" Nina said, and she was on her way.
<p>---***---
<p>Driving Helen's car, it actually took Nina less than an hour to find
the school, and she pulled into the front parking lot with time to spare.&nbsp;
Getting out, she was amazed at how many students were around, given that
this was a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; But then she remembered that a large
number of the students were boarders.&nbsp; She wasn't surprised to see
them all in uniform; the school naturally had a very strict uniform policy,
which was what the case was all about!&nbsp; Nina was surprised however
by the sudden splash of yellow exiting the building she was about to enter.&nbsp;
A group of girls had come out, and amongst them was one girl with a bright
yellow plastic bag draped over her body.&nbsp; Her head stuck out the top,
but the rest of her was hidden.&nbsp; She seemed in good spirits though
as she chatted with her friends, and only seemed self-conscious about her
apparel when she saw Nina staring at her.
<p>Nina wondered what she had on, if anything, under the bag.&nbsp; She
would have asked, but the entire group of girls was staring at her now,
making Nina feel somewhat uncomfortable.
<p>She looked down at her tight shirt and well-worn shorts, and felt very
under dressed amongst these young women.
<p>"Er...the Principal's office please?" Nina asked them.
<p>"First on the right," one of the girls answered, and Nina went in.
<p>Going in the right door, Nina found herself in a waiting area with a
long counter on the other side of the room.&nbsp; In chairs around the
waiting area sat a few girls, and Nina was surprised to see one of them
with no skirt on.&nbsp; The girl was obviously nervous, and the way the
front of her shirt draped over her lap, it was obvious the girl had no
underwear either.&nbsp; Yet the girl did nothing to move the shirt so that
it covered her.
<p>"Who on earth are you?" said an elderly female voice from across the
room.
<p>Nina looked up to see a gray haired lady in a smart office suit standing
behind the counter.&nbsp; Nina smiled and walked forward.&nbsp; "Hi, I'm
Nina West, here to pick up some files for Sarah Wickland?"
<p>"Get out!" said the old woman sharply, making Nina jump.
<p>"What?" she asked, not expecting the hostility.
<p>"I said, get out!&nbsp; How dare you come into this school dressed like
that!"
<p>Nina looked down, she didn't look THAT bad.&nbsp; "I'm just here to
pick up some files..." she began to say.
<p>"I don't care what you're here for, young lady!&nbsp; This is a school,
not a whorehouse!&nbsp; What kind of example are you showing these children,
dressed like that?"
<p>"I didn't mean to..."
<p>"Just get out and come back when you are properly dressed!"
<p>Nina had enough; she figured it was just a way of getting her to leave
without the files.&nbsp; Besides, she didn't have anything else in the
car to put on; her bag was back at Sarah's.&nbsp; "No, I won't go!&nbsp;
Just give me the files I'm here for and then I'll be on my way."
<p>The old lady scowled at her.&nbsp; "You'll have to see the Head Mistress
about that, but you aren't going to get in to see her dressed like that!"
<p>"Well this is all I have, take it or leave it!" Nina answered back angrily.
<p>"Fine," replied the old woman smugly, "I'll take it.&nbsp; Hand me your
shirt, please," she said holding out her hand.
<p>"What?" Nina asked, not quite believing she had heard right.
<p>"Your shirt, give it to me, and the shorts."
<p>"Why?"
<p>"Until you are considered decently dressed, and in THIS school that
means being in one of a limited set of acceptable outfits, you will NOT
be going in to see the Head Mistress."
<p>"I'm not taking off my clothes!" Nina exclaimed, glancing around at
all the female students watching this drama.
<p>"Then get out, it's your choice!"
<p>Nina wasn't sure what to do.&nbsp; She thought of calling Sarah, but
she doubted she would be allowed to use the phone, and she didn't want
to waste time to go look for a new outfit.&nbsp; Sarah told her not to
let them stall her, but this was a pretty big stall.&nbsp; So, unable to
think of anything else, Nina reached for the hem of her shirt and pulled
it over her head.&nbsp; Blushing, she handed it over to the old woman.
<p>"The shorts too!" ordered the old lady.
<p>Nina swallowed and undid the button holding her shorts up.&nbsp; She
pulled them off quickly and handed them across, now dressed just in bra,
panties, and sandals.
<p>The old woman shook her head.&nbsp; "That underwear, far too decorative.&nbsp;
Your bra, please."
<p>"No!"
<p>"Your BRA, young lady!" said the old woman in a voice that brought back
Nina's early school years vividly.&nbsp; Unable to stop herself, Nina reached
back and undid the clasp of her bra, slipping the garment off and revealing
to the room her firm, tanned breasts.
<p>"And just for being argumentative, your panties too." said the old woman.
<p>Nina hesitated just a moment, feeling awful about getting undressed
in a school, but then resigned herself to being naked once again and removed
her panties.&nbsp; She tried not to cover herself, knowing it was against
the rules at Cronenberg, but was hard pressed to keep her hands at her
sides.
<p>The old woman took her clothing and put it in a large wooden box next
to a desk.&nbsp; "You'll get those back later.&nbsp; Now come this way
and I'll show you to the Head Mistress's office."
<p>Nina looked once more at the faces around her, noting more than a few
smirks at her situation, and sighed.&nbsp; She went around the counter,
glad to be away from the students, but wondered where she was going to
end up.&nbsp; Without clothes, she again felt vulnerable.
<p>The old woman led her to an office, knocked once on the door, and opened
it.&nbsp; She poked her head in and said, "There is a young woman here
for those files."
<p>"Send her in, Francine," said a female voice from inside.
<p>Nina was glad at least that this was a girl's school, but that relief
was cut short when she stepped into the room.&nbsp; The Head Mistress wasn't
alone in her office.&nbsp; Sitting with her was a man in a dark blue suit.&nbsp;
He stood slowly as Nina ground to a stop, gazing in amazement at the naked
young woman.&nbsp; The Head Mistress was also surprised to see Nina nude,
but not so shocked by it that she let it show.
<p>The man was the first to speak.&nbsp; "YOU work for Sarah Wickland?"
he asked, his eyes raking Nina's body.
<p>Nina swallowed and stoically endured his stare.&nbsp; "Yes, I do.&nbsp;
Now are those files ready yet?"
<p>The man was taken aback by Nina's response.&nbsp; Evidently he expected
her to be cowered by her nudity.&nbsp; All it really did was make Nina
mad.&nbsp; She was tired of all the manipulation to get her clothes off.
<p>"May I see some ID?" he countered with a grin.
<p>"What?" Nina said, getting angrier.
<p>"Well I can hardly turn over court documents without verifying who you
are, and as it seems you aren't carrying any identification on you, I guess
you will have to leave...er, empty handed!"&nbsp; He chuckled at his joke.
<p>"Well, who the hell are you?" Nina asked.
<p>"Frank Morgenstern, Miss West, and let me say what a pleasure it is
to see..."
<p>Nina walked right up to him.&nbsp; "Listen to me...FRANK!&nbsp; I haven't
had a very good weekend because of you, and this little incident is the
last straw.&nbsp; Now you turn over those files so I can leave RIGHT NOW,
or I call my boss and she calls your Judge and..." yelled Nina
<p>"WHO the HELL do you think you are, talking to me like that!" the lawyer
yelled right back, and the two of them began arguing right there in the
office.
<p>The Head Mistress watched from her desk, not wanting to get in the middle
of it.&nbsp; She had not been in favor of the School Board's decision to
eliminate public nudity from the punishment curriculum and secretly sided
with the parents.&nbsp; But she watched with amusement the nude young woman
going toe to toe with the well-dressed older man, and she wondered just
how far it would go.
<p>What ended it stepped through the door a moment later.
<p>"What the HELL is going on around here!" yelled a booming voice, and
both Nina and Morgenstern looked over to see where it came from.
<p>A large man practically filled the doorway.
<p>"Come in Mr. Dah," said the Head Mistress, happy to see the man.
<p>"Aye, that I will.&nbsp; Morgenstern, what are you yelling at the lass
about now?" said Dah, evidently a Scot.&nbsp; He moved into the room like
a glacier, sure and looming.
<p>"Mr. Dah, how nice to see you.&nbsp; What brings you down here today?"
said Morgenstern with a fake smile on his face.
<p>Nina just stared in wonder at the Scot.&nbsp; Standing between the two
men, she felt very small, and being nude made it even worse.
<p>"My lawyer called me to let me know that you've been pulling dirty tricks
again, laddie.&nbsp; I'll not be having any of that again!"
<p>"She was misinformed.&nbsp; As I was telling Miss West here just now,
it was just a shipping error," he said smugly.
<p>Dah looked down at Nina.&nbsp; "You work for Sarah?"
<p>Nina nodded at the mountain of a man.
<p>He let his eyes take her in for a moment.&nbsp; "Well, you go stand
over there, lass, I'll deal with him and you'll get your files."
<p>"No," Nina said.
<p>Both men looked at her.&nbsp; "What?"
<p>"I said no.&nbsp; I'll deal with this, Mr. Dah; you're the client, you're
not supposed to get your hands dirty."
<p>"That's alright, lass, I'm not afraid of a little dirt."
<p>Nina whirled around, put her finger on his chest, and began to push.&nbsp;
"I will handle it!"
<p>Surprised at this slip of a girl without a slip, Dah backed up and smiled.&nbsp;
"Certainly, lass, do your job."
<p>Nina turned to face Morgenstern, who was grinning at the way the big
Scotsman had backed down.&nbsp; His smile soon left his face when Nina
reached for the phone and started dialing.
<p>"Who are you calling?"
<p>"My boss, so she can call the Judge."
<p>"There's no need for that!" he said, thinking that she was actually
going to do it.
<p>Nina made a show of looking about the office.&nbsp; "I don't see any
files here, and you've had more than an hour!"&nbsp; She continued to dial.
<p>"Come on now, you wouldn't!" he said nervously.
<p>Nina just smiled and held the phone to her head.&nbsp; "Hi Sarah, this
is Nina, I'm at the school."
<p>"FRANCINE!" yelled Morgenstern.
<p>"Yep, that's him.&nbsp; Do you want to talk to him again?" Nina said
into the phone.
<p>Morgenstern made a move toward the door.&nbsp; "I'm not talking to her,
and your damn files are right here somewhere," he said as he passed Nina.&nbsp;
"FRANCINE!"
<p>"Maybe I should just let you go so you can call the Judge," Nina said
into the phone, watching Morgenstern panic.
<p>Just as the lawyer opened the door, Francine staggered in carrying a
large cardboard file box.&nbsp; Morgenstern practically ripped it from
her hands and brought it into the room.
<p>"Here are your files, now there is no need to call anyone!" he said
angrily.
<p>Jacob Dah reached out for it.&nbsp; "I'll take those.&nbsp; I'll take
it out to your car, lass," he said to Nina.
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Dah," Nina said with a smile.&nbsp; She listened to
the phone for a moment, watching Morgenstern squirm, then held it out to
him.&nbsp; "It's for you," she said, and when he took it, she headed for
the door.
<p>Morgenstern's eyes followed Nina's shapely bare behind until it was
out the door, so he didn't really listen to the phone until she was gone.&nbsp;
When he did listen, what he heard was, "At the next tone, the time will
be 2:45, precisely."
<p>"Shit!" Morgenstern growled.&nbsp; "That bitch!"
<p>The Head Mistress smiled.
<p>Outside, Nina didn't stop for her clothes.&nbsp; Her need to get out
of the school before really losing her temper overrode even her modesty.&nbsp;
She met Jacob Dah outside, and while he put the box in the trunk for her,
Nina climbed in the front seat, still nude because apart from her outfit
in the school, the rest of her clothes were at her boss's.
<p>"You driving back like that, lass?" Dah said, coming to her window and
smiling.
<p>"I guess I'll have to," Nina replied.
<p>"Well you drive safe then.&nbsp; It was a pleasure meeting you...er..."
<p>"Nina, Nina West."&nbsp; Nina managed a smile and they shook hands.
<p>Dah was still smiling as he watched her drive away.
<p>---***---
<p>Helen was surprised to see Nina walk out into the courtyard naked, carrying
the box, but Sarah wasn't.&nbsp; Sarah had a pretty good idea what would
happen to Nina the way she was dressed, and was glad that little game paid
off.
<p>What did surprise the lawyer were the two phone calls she had gotten
while Nina was enroute back from the school.
<p>One was from Morgenstern, complaining about Nina's lack of ethics, manners,
modesty, and whatever else he could think of, especially the shameful way
he had been treated by her.
<p>The second call was from Jacob Dah, praising the young woman for basically
the same things.
<p>Sarah hadn't thought Nina had it in her to go nose to nose with Morgenstern,
especially naked, but the young woman proved her wrong.&nbsp; Sarah thought
that if Nina did go to law school and passed the Bar, she was going to
be one hell of a litigator.&nbsp; Sarah was quite proud.
<p>"Any problems?" Sarah asked her.
<p>Nina shook her head, calmed down somewhat after the long drive and glad
to be back without getting in an accident.
<p>"Good.&nbsp; Well, we still have a lot of work to do, so let's get at
it."
<p>Nina shrugged and went back to her table.
<p>---***---
<p>The rest of the day was uneventful after that.&nbsp; The women finished
the files, and after a dinner of pizza and wine (of course Nina had to
pay the pizza delivery guy), Sarah let both Helen and Nina get dressed
so they could go home.
<p>"Franklin and I can finish this up tomorrow," she said.&nbsp; "But I
could use some help, if either of you want to, that is."&nbsp; Sarah left
the request open ended as she watched the two young women, now dressed
in casual clothes.
<p>Helen and Nina looked at each other for a moment.&nbsp; "You know,"
said Helen, "it is kinda late to be driving back."
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "Yeah, and I was thinking how nice it would be to
have a swim right now."
<p>"A swim would be good.&nbsp; But I kinda want to finish this job, you
know?&nbsp; I feel like we're leaving Sarah with all the hard work yet."
<p>Nina sighed, then smiled.&nbsp; "I guess one more day won't hurt us,
even with Franklin here tomorrow."&nbsp; She reached for the hem of her
shirt and pulled it off herself.
<p>Helen blinked, blushed, then started unbuttoning her blouse.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "In that case ladies, welcome back!"
<p>The next day was embarrassing as usual, but somehow, even with Franklin
leering at them, neither Nina nor Helen minded as much.
<p>It didn't turn out to be THAT bad a weekend.

<p><br>
<p>Part 15,&nbsp; Mrs.&nbsp; Terry.
<p>Nina West saw them for the first time whilst on her way home.&nbsp;
She was being given a ride home by her work mate, Helen, because her host's
granddaughter, Kelly, had the car somewhere.&nbsp; That Kelly was out during
the day at all amazed Nina, for Kelly hadn't gotten dressed since her arrival
at the house more than a week before, so wherever she was, she was definitely
naked.
<p>This made Nina wonder for a second if it was Kelly she was seeing, for
what caught her attention on this drive home was a couple of nude young
women selling flowers from the back of a pick up truck.&nbsp; Not nearly
nude, not dressed in tiny bikinis, but completely without clothing.
<p>"Helen, do you see that?" Nina said.
<p>Helen did see it.&nbsp; "Oh, are they out again?"
<p>"You know about them?" Nina asked.&nbsp; As they drew closer Nina saw
that neither of them was Kelly, which made it seem even weirder to her
in some way.&nbsp; The two nude flower sellers seemed to be doing a fair
bit of trade; there were several cars parked around them in the store parking
lot they were set up in, and a lot of men seemed to be buying.&nbsp; Nina
knew it wasn't the blooms that were attracting the business.&nbsp; She
also saw out in plain view a police car with two officers calmly watching
over the situation.
<p>"Yeah, some kind of religious group.&nbsp; I don't know much else, except
that from time to time they pull a stunt like this in a public place,"
Helen said, concentrating on her driving, which was more than she could
say a lot of her fellow drivers were doing.
<p>"How come they're not getting arrested?&nbsp; There's a cop right there!"
Nina asked.
<p>"I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe they have permission," Helen answered.
<p>"Permission to be naked in public?" Nina asked, amazed that anyone would
want such permission.&nbsp; Then she remembered Kelly and figured that
some people just might.
<p>They drove past the flower stall and Nina swiveled round to get a last
look.&nbsp; In front of the stall was a sign, partially hidden by the bodies
of the mostly male clientele.
<p>"Church of Redemption..." was all she could see but she knew there was
more.
<p>"Wild," she said.
<p>Helen only shrugged.
<p>No more was said about it, and Helen dropped Nina off at the gate that
barred the driveway of the house where Nina lived.&nbsp; "See ya in the
morning, and have fun being naked!" Helen said with a grin, and she drove
off.
<p>Nina smiled and waved, and then sighed.&nbsp; She used a key to get
through the gate and walked slowly into the freestanding garage building.&nbsp;
Inside, as she did every day, Nina removed every piece of clothing she
had on and hung them up next to the locked door where the rest of her clothes
were kept.&nbsp; Inside she knew were all her pants, dresses, shirts...everything
normal people wore the majority of their waking hours.&nbsp; For Nina life
was different, though.&nbsp; Her "rent" was paid with service, not with
money, and that service was that every hour she stayed on the property,
she was to stay nude.
<p>At first, as frightening as it was, it hadn't seemed too bad.&nbsp;
Her host, Brian Cook was a dear old man whose only designs on her naked
body had to do with his art.&nbsp; Brian, a retired lawyer, was a sculptor,
and in many ways Nina was his current model.&nbsp; Then there was the housekeeper,
Mrs. Terry, who liked to be nude all the time for reasons of her own.
<p>If it had just stayed like that, then Nina could have handled the constant
home nudity a lot better, but it seemed she was always meeting people who
had ways of either getting her clothes off and/or seeing her naked.
<p>The most successful was her boss, Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; Nina spent most
of her workday in the senior partner's office now, which meant she spent
most of her day nude as well.&nbsp; It seemed to Nina lately, that she
dressed only for the drive to and from work, and she wondered how long
THAT would last.
<p>Grabbing the carry case with her laptop computer inside, Nina stepped
out of the building and quickly made her way up the driveway to the house.&nbsp;
She moved quickly because she was visible through the wrought iron gate
for a least a short way up the drive, and Nina wanted to limit her visibility
as much as she could from the traffic outside.&nbsp; She was sure that
the sight of a nude young woman would attract as much attention here as
it did for those poor flower girls.
<p>---***---
<p>"Come on, Nina, you'll have fun!" said Kelly, standing on the patio
in all her nude glory several hours later.&nbsp; Over the past week, her
pale skin had darkened a little, her all over tan developing nicely.&nbsp;
She still had the figure of a boy, very slim with smallish breasts, but
she was also very pretty, and in her current state of undress, quite appealing
to guys.
<p>The odd thing about Kelly though, Nina sometimes thought, was how sexless
the girl was.&nbsp; Kelly was forever telling stories of stuff she had
done while being naked, stories that made Nina shudder at times, but rarely
had anything sexual been involved.&nbsp; Kelly, it seemed, while she loved
to show her body off to the men around her, rarely got intimate with any
of them.&nbsp; She was just their naked friend.
<p>Now Kelly was trying to get Nina involved with her friends.&nbsp; Kelly
was off to a lake party someplace, nude of course, and wanted Nina to come
with her, also nude.
<p>"Kelly, I have all this work to finish doing," Nina said with a sigh,
gesturing at her laptop and a bunch of scattered paperwork on the patio
table.&nbsp; Nina was working outside, or at least trying to, enjoying
the warmth of the sun on her bare back.
<p>"You can do all that tomorrow; you need to relax, you work too hard!"
Kelly said.
<p>"Well, I have to get this done, so I can't come."
<p>Nina thought that would be the end of it, but then she felt two hands
on her shoulders and two points touching her back.&nbsp; As Kelly leaned
over her, Nina knew that what she felt was the girl's bare nipples and
she shivered at the shock.
<p>"Jim's going to be there; he's been asking for you," Kelly whispered.
<p>Nina held her breath, conscious of how close Kelly was to her.&nbsp;
Then she thought about Jim, the handsome college senior she had met on
the beach the night of Kelly's arrival.&nbsp; She would be lying if she
said she had never thought about him, but he had seen her naked, and had
even dared her to go for a run around a city block with nothing on.&nbsp;
Nina felt too embarrassed to see him again.
<p>Yet...
<p>"I...can't.&nbsp; I really have to get this done," she stammered.
<p>"Hmmmm, well, if I can't even tempt you with Jim!"&nbsp; Kelly moved
away.&nbsp; "Still, he's a nice guy and he likes you, and judging from
the way you're blushing, you must like him.&nbsp; You could do a lot worse!"&nbsp;
Kelly laughed.&nbsp; "Don't wait up for me!"
<p>Nina watched her leave and let out a breath.&nbsp; Kelly seemed to have
no concept of personal space, as well as no modesty.&nbsp; Nina wished
she knew how Kelly did it.
<p>But what Nina said was true; there was work to be done, so she got started.&nbsp;
She worked quietly until after the sunset and the bugs started to get bad,
before finally stopping for the day and packing up.&nbsp; Looking up at
the house, she saw that Brian's suite of rooms was dark, the old man having
gone to bed early again, but there was a light in the housekeeper's rooms.
<p>Nina took her stuff upstairs and was about to turn on her TV when she
stopped and sighed.&nbsp; She felt like company, and thought about calling
Helen.&nbsp; But for some reason, she didn't feel like calling her friend;
she saw a lot of Helen at work, who in turn got to see a lot more of Nina.&nbsp;
No, Nina felt like spending time with someone else.&nbsp; After a pause,
she wondered what Mrs. Terry was doing.
<p>Nina left her room and padded along the carpeted hallway toward the
other side of the house.&nbsp; She felt odd going calling in the nude,
even though she and the housekeeper had spent countless hours naked with
each other since Nina came to live there.&nbsp; It just seemed different
when you were going to someone's bedroom.
<p>When she reached the door, she could hear the faint sounds of a television
and thought that maybe Mrs. Terry was busy.&nbsp; But she took a deep breath
and knocked anyway.
<p>The TV was turned down, and a moment later the door opened to reveal
the nude housekeeper.&nbsp; "Hello, Miss West, is there something you need?"&nbsp;
Her normal dour expression was tinged with a look of concern, Nina never
having knocked on her door before.
<p>"Er...actually...I was...well.&nbsp; If you're busy I could go away,"
said Nina slowly.
<p>Mrs. Terry looked at her for a moment then opened the door a little
wider.&nbsp; "I'm not that busy, dear.&nbsp; Just watching the ice-skating.&nbsp;
Come in."
<p>Nina stepped in and looked around, this her first visit to this part
of the house.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry didn't have just a bedroom but a small suite
of rooms.&nbsp; It looked well lived in and decorated in a style all its
own.&nbsp; There was a living room, a small kitchenette, and a couple of
doors that led presumably to a bedroom and bathroom.&nbsp; All very cozy
except for the huge floor to ceiling windows that let in the great outdoors.&nbsp;
The TV was on, and Nina could indeed see that ice-skating was being shown.
<p>Mrs. Terry headed over to the kitchenette.&nbsp; "Go sit on the couch,
dear; you look like you need to talk."
<p>"Thanks," Nina said.&nbsp; The couch looked comfortable, and Nina walked
around it and got a surprise.&nbsp; Lying on it was a blanket, a loose
blanket.&nbsp; In Nina's room, none of the bedclothes was loose, so Nina
couldn't be tempted to use them for clothing.&nbsp; It had been a while
since she saw a blanket that wasn't fastened down.&nbsp; She was tempted
to pick it up and wrap herself in it, but instead just sat down on the
soft couch.&nbsp; She enjoyed the feel of the material against her skin;
it was very smooth.
<p>Mrs. Terry came back with a mug in her hand.&nbsp; "Here, some hot chocolate."
<p>"Thank you!" Nina said, surprised.&nbsp; She took the offered mug and
got a smile from the housekeeper, who sat down next to her.&nbsp; To Nina's
further surprise, Mrs. Terry picked up the blanket, curled up on the couch,
and covered herself with it.&nbsp; Then she looked over at Nina and smiled.&nbsp;
"I know, why the blanket?&nbsp; Well, young lady, just because I enjoy
my nudity doesn't mean I can't be comfortable when I want to be.&nbsp;
I like watching TV under a blanket."&nbsp; She reached out and held up
one end.&nbsp; "I suspect it's been a while since you were comfortable
here, really comfortable.&nbsp; Come on, scoot over, there's plenty of
blanket.
<p>Nina hesitated, then took up the invitation, moving over to get under
the offered covering.&nbsp; She wasn't close enough to touch the housekeeper,
but the blanket held her warmth, and just the act of wrapping her naked
body felt good to Nina.&nbsp; She grinned, took a sip of her hot chocolate,
and looked at the TV.
<p>Mrs. Terry smiled as well.&nbsp; "Feels good, doesn't it?&nbsp; I know.&nbsp;
I was wondering when you were going to come by; most have when a certain
point was reached."
<p>"Most?" Nina asked.
<p>"Most of Mr. Cook's former models.&nbsp; You do know there were others
before you, right?"
<p>Nina nodded, she had sort of gathered that.
<p>"I was the first; you are...I think...the eighth...ninth.&nbsp; Hmmm,"
said the older woman.&nbsp; "Yes, nine."
<p>"Nine?" Nina said, not quite believing it.
<p>"Oh yes.&nbsp; They can never stay for long, you see.&nbsp; Maybe a
year, maybe two.&nbsp; There were a couple that didn't work out at all,
and Mr. Cook fired them after just a month.&nbsp; Others were given the
same options you were given, and earned quite a bit of money when they
finished their lease, not to mention having a whole new outlook on their
bodies and their life."&nbsp; Mrs. Terry smiled.
<p>"Why do they come to you?" Nina asked.
<p>The housekeeper looked at her.&nbsp; "Why did you?"
<p>Nina looked down.
<p>"Dear, I know all about it.&nbsp; It's tough isn't it, having a part
of you that you have kept private for so long being exposed for everyone
to see.&nbsp; It SEEMS like everyone, doesn't it?&nbsp; I know that even
when you're dressed, you feel that people can still see your body; that
the clothes you put on just serve to enhance your nudity rather than cover
it up.&nbsp; It's a big adjustment, isn't it?"
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "It has been tough.&nbsp; It's like I rarely get
to wear much anymore.&nbsp; Even at work I have to strip."
<p>"What?" Mrs. Terry said, not quite expecting that.
<p>Nina clamped her mouth shut, not meaning to say anything about that.&nbsp;
"It's nothing."
<p>"It's something, and I can see it upsets you.&nbsp; You can tell me,
trust me, I've been through what you're going through, and you would be
surprised at what else I've been through.&nbsp; I could even stun young
Kelly with my stories, and that's no lie."
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "You have stories that beat Kelly's?"
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded.&nbsp; "Oh yes.&nbsp; Remember, I've been doing this
on and off for twenty-five years, that's longer than that girl has been
alive.&nbsp; Tell you what.&nbsp; You tell me what's upsetting you at work,
and I'll tell you about the time I got into trouble with the police."
<p>Nina thought about it for a moment, watching a couple of skaters on
TV go through a difficult routine, then she began to speak.&nbsp; She started
to tell Mrs. Terry about Sarah Wickland.
<p>As Nina talked, Mrs. Terry listened quietly, but a small smile showed
on her face, and when Nina noticed, she thought that the housekeeper was
enjoying the humiliation Nina had been through.&nbsp; She even accused
the older woman of such.
<p>"Oh no, I'm smiling for a completely different reason, dear," said Mrs.
Terry.
<p>"Like what?" Nina challenged.
<p>"Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; I don't know if I'm at liberty to tell you this,
but considering the lengths that woman has gone to have some power over
you, I feel it only right to let you know more about her than she would
probably want you to know."
<p>Now Nina was curious.&nbsp; "You know her?&nbsp; What can you tell me
about her?"
<p>"Oh yes, I know her...knew her.&nbsp; I rarely see her anymore, but
the two of you have much more in common than you might think.&nbsp; For
she used to be one of Mr. Cook's models."
<p>Nina was stunned.&nbsp; "You're kidding!"
<p>Mrs. Terry chuckled, her eyes on the TV screen.&nbsp; "I thought you
would like that."
<p>"When?&nbsp; How?" Nina asked, thinking that her friend Helen would
also love to know.
<p>"I'd say maybe twenty years ago.&nbsp; She was the model after me, when
I left after marrying my husband.&nbsp; She had just finished law school,
I believe, and like you had been sponsored by Mr. Cook and the firm.&nbsp;
Back then, Mr. Cook was still an active partner, and he told me later that
he saw in young Sarah the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e he never thought he would
ever find.
<p>"He took personal care of her career and her training, and then when
he retired, he passed all of his practice on to her, as well as his place
with the senior partners.&nbsp; But the first two years Sarah spent working
at the firm, she spent living here, under the exact same conditions you
live under, Nina.&nbsp; All her time here was spent nude, and she inspired
several pieces of artwork by Mr. Cook."
<p>"I can't believe that!" Nina exclaimed, but then thinking about it,
she could.&nbsp; All the things Sarah had done to her and Helen, her fascination
with nudity, and the casual way she remained naked with them in her home
the weekend before.
<p>"It's true; just ask her, and see what she says.&nbsp; You could also
ask her where she went to school."
<p>"I don't understand," Nina said.
<p>Mrs. Terry smiled.&nbsp; "Let's just say, that when she came here, Sarah
Wickland was already used to periods of enforced nudity."
<p>Nina thought about this for a moment, watching the skaters do their
thing, then the answer hit her.&nbsp; "Cronenberg?"
<p>Mrs. Terry only smiled.
<p>Nina giggled, and let evil thoughts of her boss drift through her head
for a while as she finished her hot chocolate.&nbsp; She was almost done
when she remembered something else.
<p>"Mrs. Terry, you promised to tell me about when you got in trouble with
the police?"
<p>The housekeeper pulled her blanket a little closer around her and nodded
slowly.&nbsp; "Yes, I promised.&nbsp; Alright then, but first a little
background on me, or you won't understand it."
<p>"Okay," said Nina.
<p>"Like you, Nina, I'm from a small town, and after high school I struck
out on my own to be anyplace else but with my parents.&nbsp; Back then,
I wanted nothing to do with them, although later on we went back and made
our peace.&nbsp; But at that time I traveled around, doing whatever work
I could...before ending up here at this house taking on a job as assistant
housekeeper.&nbsp; I was hired on with the expectation of becoming the
full time housekeeper after Mrs. Hedlum retired.&nbsp; Mrs. Hedlum had
been with the family for close to fifty years by then.&nbsp; I hired on
gladly; I loved the house, which looked quite different back then; I loved
the community; and being young, I loved the wonderful weather and the closeness
of the ocean.&nbsp; I especially enjoyed working for Mr. Cook.&nbsp; The
poor man had recently been widowed, and his daughter was away full time
becoming a doctor, so he lived here alone, but he was a cheerful man and
a pleasure to be around.
<p>"Then one day while I was admiring some paintings he had done, he asked
me if I would consent to model for him.&nbsp; I was pretty and vain back
then, and also quite honored to be asked, so I said yes, and he used me
quite often as an occasional model.&nbsp; At first, it was nothing; I'd
come in and he'd pose me, and that was all.&nbsp; But soon he requested
that I wear less and less, until it was natural for me to be posing nude.
<p>By then, I had taken over the house full time, Mrs. Hedlum having retired
and moved away.&nbsp; And I thought all was good until my past started
catching up with me.&nbsp; During my travels after high school, I wracked
up some pretty heavy debts, moving on when they became too much for me.&nbsp;
But now that I had begun to put down roots, my debtors began to find me.&nbsp;
I managed to keep it from Mr. Cook for a while, but he discovered my secret.&nbsp;
I thought I was going to be fired, but instead he had me confess all to
him, and he went and paid everyone every dime I owed them.&nbsp; He then
gave me two options.&nbsp; I could either pay him back out of my paycheck
each month, or we would come to some other arrangement."&nbsp; Mrs. Terry
looked over at the spellbound Nina and blushed.&nbsp; "When he told me
that he didn't want me wearing clothes at all while at home, I almost left
him right then and there.&nbsp; But after he explained about what he needed
for his art, his paintings and the sculpting he wanted to do, and that
after two years I'd earn the same amount of money he paid to my debtors,
I couldn't pass it up.&nbsp; So, right there in his home office, I took
off my clothes and handed them to him.&nbsp; It was...scary...humiliating...yet
my heart was thumping and I have to admit I was excited.&nbsp; Locking
up my clothing came later, after a few times when I felt I HAD to wear
something, and we learned a few other things from those days of experimentation
as well.&nbsp; But I persevered, and the longer I went without clothes,
the more used to it I got."
<p>"But what does that have to do with the police?" Nina asked.
<p>"I'm coming to that.&nbsp; Now, it was during this time that Mr. Cook
hired a young gardener named Martin Terry..."
<p>"Your husband?" Nina said suddenly.
<p>"Yes, but not at that time.&nbsp; Mr. Cook hired him to do two things.&nbsp;
To make a showcase of his property because it really hadn't been well cared
for until then, and also to design a way to screen the house and the entire
property using landscaping.&nbsp; You see, back then this house was rather
isolated.&nbsp; The housing you see all around us wasn't here yet.&nbsp;
But the area had recently opened up, and Mr. Cook knew that soon we were
to have neighbors.&nbsp; If I was to continue spending time nude outdoors,
then the place needed to be screened.&nbsp; So Mr. Terry took the job,
not knowing at the time just why Mr. Cook was so particular.&nbsp; He found
out soon enough, though.&nbsp; At first, I avoided going out when the gardener
was there.&nbsp; But Mr. Cook insisted that I continue on as normal, so
the first time my husband saw me, I was nude and serving him a glass of
iced tea."&nbsp; Mrs. Terry paused for a moment, reliving the memory in
her head with a smile.&nbsp; "You must have noticed, Nina, how men look
at you when you're nude."
<p>"Yes," Nina said, remembering the way most of them leered at her or
couldn't seem to find her face.
<p>Mrs. Terry saw what she was thinking.&nbsp; "No, I mean...well...not
the general class of men who can't think without their penis, but the men
who see YOU, as well as your body.&nbsp; You must have met one or two of
them!"
<p>Nina sat and thought about it for a moment, and for some reason her
thoughts drifted to Jim, the guy Kelly introduced her to.&nbsp; She nodded.
<p>"Well, that was Mr. Terry.&nbsp; Every time we saw each other, it was
like he saw my soul, and soon we talked a little while he worked.&nbsp;
That man got in my head and didn't get out.&nbsp; After a little while,
I knew I was falling for him, but that wasn't all that was happening to
me.&nbsp; I was also enjoying my nudity to the point that I was taking
risks I shouldn't.&nbsp; The hills around here were still relatively free
of homes and other buildings, so at night when I was off duty, I would
take nude walks around the countryside, sometimes for miles.
<p>"It was on one of those walks that I got into trouble.&nbsp; I was walking
around this brand new housing estate, not thinking that anybody was really
living there yet.&nbsp; But evidently someone was.&nbsp; And unlike few
other people who had caught glimpses of me in the past, whoever it was
called the police.
<p>"The first I knew of it was when I saw a police car turn a corner onto
the street I was walking down.&nbsp; I ran and hid, and they went past.&nbsp;
But as I tried to make my way home, I found that whichever way I went,
I saw police cars moving slowly along with their search lights on.&nbsp;
Let me tell you, Nina, I was scared.&nbsp; There I was, completely naked,
at least a mile from my clothes and anywhere I considered safe, and the
police were obviously looking for me.&nbsp; I ran, hid, ran again, always
trying to stay ahead of them, but they caught me in the end, and I never
felt so vulnerable than when that searchlight lit me up in the middle of
someone's front yard, and that voice yelled FREEZE!
<p>The officers in the car ran out to me and made me stand spread-eagled;
my hands on the hood of the car while one of them FRISKED me.&nbsp; I mean,
really, there I was naked to the world, and he had the nerve to frisk me
as if I was carrying a concealed weapon on me.&nbsp; Then, in full view
of the few neighbors occupying the houses around us, who had evidently
heard the noise and came out to investigate, the police handcuffed me and
made me stand there while they read me my rights.&nbsp; I had never been
so humiliated; everyone could plainly see me.&nbsp; Yet, to be honest,
dear Nina, I was also getting a perverse pleasure from it.&nbsp; Oh yes,
it's true.&nbsp; Now, I was never the exhibitionist Kelly is, but for some
reason I was excited at my forced exposure.&nbsp; Still, the reality of
the situation was also sinking in, and I thought I would be going to jail
for sure.&nbsp; They asked me who I was and where I lived, because I obviously
had no identification on me.&nbsp; I told them my name, but I hesitated
over where I lived.&nbsp; Mr. Cook at that time was a prominent attorney,
and I felt that if I told them I lived here with him, that HIS reputation
would suffer, and that I didn't want to see happening.&nbsp; So, I thought
quickly and gave them the address of the only other person I trusted.&nbsp;
Mr. Terry.
<p>So they put in the back of the car and took me over to his home."&nbsp;
Mrs. Terry started to blush again, evidently affected by the memory of
the story she was telling.
<p>"When they brought him out of the house to identify me, I almost died
in shame.&nbsp; They had me standing next to the car, and while he had
seen me nude many times, it seemed worse to be seen out there in the street
with my hands cuffed behind me.&nbsp; Mr. Terry took his time too, and
I knew he was angry with me.&nbsp; Bless him, though, he backed me up,
said I lived with him, and that I was his girlfriend.&nbsp; He and one
of the policemen talked for a long time away where I couldn't hear them,
all the while with me standing naked by the police car with some of Mr.
Terry's neighbors now getting a good look at me, even though they should
all have been in bed at that hour.
<p>Then the policeman came over to me and took off the cuffs, telling me
that he was releasing me in Mr. Terry's custody, but that if I were ever
caught again, he'd throw the book at me.&nbsp; I was immensely relieved,
and was dying to go inside out of view of the neighbors.&nbsp; But Mr.
Terry had me wait right next to him while we watched the police car drive
away, before he took me inside his home."&nbsp; Mrs. Terry paused, and
didn't appear to want to say anymore.
<p>"Then what happened, did he take you home?" Nina asked gently, amazed
at the story this dour looking woman had just told her.
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded.&nbsp; "Eventually," she whispered.
<p>"Eventually?" Nina asked.
<p>Mrs. Terry blushed even more, and then looked at her.&nbsp; The look
said it all and Nina sat back.
<p>"I'll get you some more chocolate," the housekeeper said and she got
up.
<p>"He saved you, then; he must have been quite a man," Nina said.
<p>"He was," said Mrs. Terry from the kitchenette.&nbsp; "That night was
the start of our life together, although he was pretty mad at me getting
caught like that.&nbsp; He, er..." the housekeeper clammed up.
<p>"He what?"
<p>Mrs. Terry came back to the couch and handed Nina a fresh mug of hot
chocolate.&nbsp; "Never mind, it's personal.&nbsp; Still, the ride home
afterward was fun, and scary."
<p>"Oh yes?" Nina said, wishing she knew what the housekeeper almost confessed.
<p>"Oh yes.&nbsp; Mr. Terry didn't have a car; he rode around on a motorcycle,
a Harley Davidson.&nbsp; When it came time for me to be taken back, I of
course didn't have any clothes on me, and he hadn't let me put on any of
his.&nbsp; He told me that he was going to take me back as I was, and he
did.&nbsp; It was really frightening, hanging on the back of him as we
cruised down city streets.&nbsp; The dawn breaking, and me not wearing
a thing.&nbsp; I huddled close to him, using his body for cover, but it
was still pretty obvious I was nude to anyone who saw us, and a few drivers
did.&nbsp; I was beet red and shaking by the time I climbed uncomfortably
off his motorcycle, but at that point I knew I wouldn't have traded that
night for anything."&nbsp; Mrs. Terry smiled and Nina did too.&nbsp; The
young women felt closer now to the housekeeper, and she wouldn't have traded
THIS evening for anything either.&nbsp; She yawned.
<p>"You look tired, dear, and it's almost my bed time.&nbsp; What say we
talk again another time," said Mrs. Terry.
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "Sure.&nbsp; It was wonderful spending the time with
you."
<p>The two women said their goodnights, and Mrs. Terry gently herded the
younger girl out the door.&nbsp; She felt exhausted telling the story of
that night, a story she rarely told anyone, and she smiled at the memories
of that first night with her then future husband.&nbsp; Out of habit she
rubbed her ass cheeks, thinking about how she almost told Nina of how being
taken home naked was not the only punishment she received.&nbsp; Martin
had also given her a sound spanking, and repeated it just before the ride
back on the motorcycle.&nbsp; It was a sexual pattern they followed the
rest of their marriage, and Mrs. Terry never quite got used to the added
humiliation of having her obviously recently spanked butt on display when
she was naked.&nbsp; But those spankings were missed now; it was hard being
a widow.
<p>With a smile, Mrs. Terry went to bed, her ass cheeks tingling at the
memory.

<p>Part 16, Walkabout.
<p>This time Nina West couldn't avoid it.&nbsp; Despite her reluctance
and her obvious embarrassment, Nina had been cajoled into going to a party
with Kelly, the granddaughter of her host, Brian Cook.
<p>She had hoped that the old man would have refused to let Nina go that
day, for he had planned on having her spend the afternoon in his studio
so he could get some detail work done on his latest piece with her as the
model.&nbsp; But when Kelly told him about the party, Brian just smiled
and said, "Of course she can go.&nbsp; It'll do her good to get out of
the house for a while."
<p>Nina just sighed and resigned herself to another embarrassing day.&nbsp;
It wasn't that she hated parties, she rather enjoyed them, and to be honest
really did need the company.&nbsp; It was just that Kelly expected Nina
to go with her dressed exactly the same way SHE was, which was in nothing
at all.&nbsp; Kelly was well on her way to breaking her record for consecutive
days nude, and saw no reason for Nina to be dressed when she didn't HAVE
to be.&nbsp; Apparently, young Kelly thought a drive across town and out
into the countryside was NOT a good reason to be dressed.
<p>So, Nina sucked it up, gathered her courage, and climbed naked into
the car with Kelly, who as usual was smiling broadly and talking a mile
a minute.&nbsp; As they pulled out of the garage/gate house at the end
of the driveway, Nina looked up helplessly at the small apartment where
her clothes were locked up, fervently wishing for at least a blanket.
<p>It wasn't Nina's first trip off the property nude, but rarely did she
go in broad daylight.&nbsp; Kelly had the top down in her little convertible,
and Nina felt exposed and vulnerable as the sun beat down on them and the
wind whipped around their bare bodies.
<p>Nina slouched down, hoping not to be seen by passing traffic, and glanced
over at Kelly who sat up as if without a care in the world.&nbsp; As the
occasional driver, who spotted how under dressed the women were, would
honk their horn, Kelly would wave back and smile.&nbsp; Her utter shamelessness
simply stunned Nina, who was red from embarrassment.&nbsp; How did Kelly
do it?
<p>Things got easier as they left the town behind and got on the highway.&nbsp;
Traffic was sparse and they were pretty much alone on the road.
<p>"Where are we going?" Nina asked her naked friend.
<p>"It's a lake party.&nbsp; Jim's uncle has a place in the hills and he's
letting Jim use it this week.&nbsp; Jim thought it would be a good time
to get the group together.&nbsp; I know he'll be glad I finally got you
to come to one of these things!"&nbsp; Kelly gave Nina a knowing grin.
<p>Nina blushed a little more.&nbsp; She had only met Jim once, but once
was enough, it seemed.&nbsp; Nina found herself thinking a lot about the
handsome college senior, and from the way Kelly kept talking about him,
Nina assumed she was on his mind as well.&nbsp; Nina's only regret was
that she had been nude when Jim had met her.&nbsp; If she had been dressed,
then at least she might have felt that he was interested in her as a person
rather than just as Kelly's nude friend, because from the stories Kelly
told, it seemed Jim enjoyed inventing games and tasks for Kelly to do in
her nudity that made Nina very nervous.&nbsp; She was sure that Jim would
love to have the opportunity to play those same games with her, and Nina
wondered if she could do that.&nbsp; Nina folded her arms about her bare
breasts and wondered what he would think of her now, seeing her again when
she didn't have any clothes to put on.&nbsp; Would he be tempted to make
her play one of those games?&nbsp; She would have hated him for it, if
only...Nina didn't know why she found someone with such a cruel streak
so attractive.&nbsp; If she had any sense, Nina thought, she should have
been running in the other direction.&nbsp; If only Kelly had allowed her
to wear SOMETHING.&nbsp; But the girl was so insistent, Nina didn't stand
a chance.&nbsp; Once again, Nina wondered just why she let herself get
pushed around like that.
<p>It seemed like everyone was out to get her naked these days.&nbsp; Now
here she was, miles from town without a stitch to her name.
<p>They drove for over an hour, moving away from the coast and into the
hills.&nbsp; In the distance Nina could see the mountains, and hoped they
weren't going that far, but the further they went, the lonelier it got.&nbsp;
Towards the end of the drive, Nina was actually able to relax, and she
lay back in her seat and allowed the sun to soak into her skin.
<p>Nina didn't notice Kelly glancing over at her every now and then.&nbsp;
Despite her continuous nudity, Kelly was still very pale and was slightly
jealous of Nina's ability to tan so well.&nbsp; Nina had a deep golden
tan that went well with her general coloring, and with her figure, it was
a hard package to beat.&nbsp; Kelly, boyish in comparison, loved looking
at Nina, especially during those unguarded moments when Nina let it all
hang out.&nbsp; Kelly understood her grandfather's obsession with humiliation
and how it influenced his art, but that wasn't how Kelly saw nudity herself.&nbsp;
She much preferred seeing Nina as she was now, relaxed and at ease with
her nudity; it made her just so damn attractive.&nbsp; It was Kelly's wish
that Nina find the happiness in her nudity that Kelly had found in hers.
<p>Nina had closed her eyes for a little while, half lulled to sleep by
the sun and the motion of the car, but opened them when the car slowed.
<p>"Just a little further," Kelly said, turning the car onto a narrow dirt
road.
<p>Nina nodded and sat up, ducking her head as a very low branch grazed
the top of the windshield.&nbsp; This wasn't so much a road as a dirt track,
with vegetation so overgrown that it brushed both sides of the little car
as they went by.&nbsp; But none of this really bothered Nina; it actually
made her happier.&nbsp; With this much isolation, the number of people
she would be exposing herself to would have to be small.&nbsp; At least
the general public wouldn't see her.&nbsp; For the first time since she
left the house, Nina was actually looking forward to this, and to seeing
Jim again.
<p>The car continued on its way for about ten minutes, rocking as it negotiated
the bumpy track.&nbsp; Then they emerged into a clearing where a log cabin
sat next to a lake.&nbsp; There were a half dozen cars already parked by
the cabin and Kelly pulled up next to them.
<p>"Phew," she said with a grin, "I'm glad we made it.&nbsp; I really need
to pee!&nbsp; I'll meet you by the lake!"&nbsp; She jumped out of the car,
and before Nina could react, she made a beeline for the cabin.
<p>A little lost, Nina looked over to the lake and saw a group of people
congregated almost out of sight on the other side of the cabin.&nbsp; Nina
wondered if she ought to get out of the car...if she COULD get out of the
car...and once again felt her nudity.&nbsp; Still, maybe Jim was over there,
and it seemed dumb to her to have come all this way only to stay and hide.
<p>Nina thought about Kelly and how she just went about as if she wasn't
nude, and once again wondered why it was so easy for her.&nbsp; Nina wished
she was that carefree.
<p>She looked over at the barely visible group and sighed.&nbsp; All she
had to do was get out of the car and walk over.&nbsp; It wasn't as if she
would be shocking anyone.&nbsp; Being friends of Kelly, they were obviously
used to seeing a naked woman around.&nbsp; It was entirely possible that
a lot of them were the same guys she had met the same night she met Jim.&nbsp;
So her body was hardly something new.&nbsp; Perhaps, in the privacy this
place afforded, she and Kelly wouldn't be the only nude people there.
<p>Nina felt she was being silly, and decided to do something.&nbsp; She
so opened the door and stepped out of the car.
<p>Walking around the house was hard, as hard as walking out of the surf
that night she had first met Jim and his friends, as hard as removing her
dress during that first party Brian had held at their home.&nbsp; She was
very aware of the cool wet grass under her feet, the smell of the vegetation
around her, the feel of the slight breeze in the air across her nipples,
the sound of the insects buzzing around her.&nbsp; In fact, the insects
were becoming a bother, mosquitoes circling her like biplanes around King
Kong.&nbsp; She had to swat at a few as she walked, and only noticed the
conversation from the group when it stopped.
<p>She stopped too, and stood and stared at the dozen or so people lounging
by the side of the lake staring back at her.&nbsp; All were dressed, although
some were in swimsuits, and all were looking intensely at the naked girl,
making her blush.
<p>Nina didn't recognize any of them, and was about to run for cover, thinking
that Kelly had set her up to expose herself to absolute strangers, when
a familiar voice called from the back of the cabin, now behind her.
<p>"Nina, it's great to see you again, glad you could come!" said Jim.
<p>Nina almost fainted in relief and turned to face him.&nbsp; She saw
him immediately give her body a once over with his eyes, and she blushed.&nbsp;
The way he looked at her touched her in a way she couldn't quite describe.
<p>Jim was holding a large platter of uncooked burgers in one hand and
was dressed in just a pair of swimshorts; he came down to meet her.&nbsp;
"Hi," he said with a smile, holding his hand out.
<p>"Hi," Nina said, smiling back.&nbsp; She took his hand and enjoyed the
touch.
<p>"How was the drive?&nbsp; Don't tell me you came all the way out here
like that?" he asked with a grin.
<p>Nina blushed some more and nodded.&nbsp; "Kelly wouldn't have it any
other way," she replied.
<p>"No, I guess she wouldn't.&nbsp; But I'm glad you did; you're too beautiful
for clothes."
<p>'Yeah, right,' she thought.&nbsp; She slapped at another mosquito.
<p>"Come on, I'll introduce you, and we'll find some bug spray for you."
<p>"That would be really great," Nina said, meaning about the spray.&nbsp;
She wasn't so sure about meeting anyone else in her condition.
<p>Jim led her over to a brick barbecue pit, where he passed the burgers
over to a couple of guys who couldn't take their eyes off Nina, and he
introduced them.&nbsp; Nina just smiled and nodded.&nbsp; Jim then took
her on a tour of the group, sounding out names and making sure she saw
everyone.&nbsp; All the guys were big grins and shifting eyes that rarely
looked her in the face.&nbsp; While most of the women seemed pleased to
see her, others were more annoyed by the way Nina attracted their escorts'
attentions.&nbsp; But they were all polite and friendly in their way.
<p>Kelly came out while the introductions were being made and casually
said hi to everyone while she dug for a beer in one of the coolers.&nbsp;
Many of the guys looked over at this second nude female, but were drawn
back to looking at Nina.&nbsp; Kelly was pretty enough in her way, but
Nina was something else.
<p>"Hey, when's your uncle going to pave that track, Jim?" Kelly said with
a smirk.
<p>Jim shrugged.&nbsp; "No idea; I kinda like it that way though.&nbsp;
Come on, Nina, let's get you sprayed down before the bugs carry you away."
<p>Someone produced a can of spray and Jim did the honors.
<p>"Stand straight...there you go."
<p>He began with her back, and Nina shivered as the cold spray hit her
skin.&nbsp; He gave her a liberal coating, working his way down across
her butt and down her legs.
<p>"Turn," he ordered, "arms up," and Nina obeyed, feeling even more exposed
as she raised her arms but somehow not minding as much.&nbsp; This time
Jim sprayed from her feet on up, smiling as he sprayed her crotch and looking
her in the eye as he sprayed her chest.&nbsp; The cool spray shocked her
as it coated her bare breasts, and Nina felt her nipples begin to harden.&nbsp;
Looking into Jim's eyes made them harden even more, and she found herself
staring at him, forgetting for a moment that she was naked.
<p>Jim smiled after a moment.&nbsp; "You'll have to rub that in," he said.
<p>"What?" Nina asked, confused.
<p>"The spray.&nbsp; Make sure to rub it in all over."
<p>"Oh, yes," Nina said, coming back to earth.&nbsp; She absentmindedly
began to rub her arms and body and turned to the task of protecting herself
from the mosquitoes that had followed her around.
<p>Conversation had resumed among the group, but many a pair of eyes followed
the movements of the nude woman as she ran her hands over every square
inch of her body.&nbsp; The bug spray made her skin shine, and with her
tan it made her look like she was glowing.&nbsp; A few of the guys had
to change how they sat or stood.
<p>But as in all things, people adapted, and soon Nina wasn't quite the
distraction she had been.&nbsp; Jim gave her a beer, and steered her toward
a group of people she could talk to while he helped out with the food.&nbsp;
Kelly sat in the middle of the largest group and became the center of attention
once more.
<p>As time went on, Nina became more relaxed with the situation and began
to have a good time.&nbsp; She kept sneaking glances at Jim, though, who
presented a striking figure in just his swimsuit.&nbsp; But he didn't seem
to be paying any attention to her at all, and Nina felt a little put out
about it.&nbsp; She was unaware of just how much attention Jim WAS paying
her, though.&nbsp; He knew that Nina was a beauty, but seeing her in the
sunlight rather than in the dead of night on a lonely beach almost took
his breath away.&nbsp; He had to force himself not to stand and stare at
her.&nbsp; And it wasn't just because she was nude, although that was a
major attraction, he had to admit, but because she was...well...Nina.&nbsp;
Jim was infatuated.
<p>---***---
<p>Food was served, everyone pronounced it good, and the day progressed
with everyone having a good time.&nbsp; At one point, there was general
rush into the lake, and Nina was glad to be in the water.&nbsp; She swam
out to the center of the small lake and watched as others entered and paddled
around.&nbsp; Most wore swimsuits; some the clothes they came in.&nbsp;
Nina noted one couple that decided to skinny dip, to the amusement of the
rest of the group.&nbsp; She didn't notice Jim until he surfaced quite
close to her.
<p>"Hi," he said, a soft smile on his lips.
<p>"Hi," Nina replied, feeling a little tongue-tied.
<p>"I'm sorry I ignored you," he said slowly, treading water next to her,
"some of these guys I only see once a year, and I had to touch base with
them, you know?"
<p>"I understand," Nina said.
<p>"I know we'll get a lot more chances to talk, to spend time together."
<p>"Will we?&nbsp; I'd like that...to talk, I mean," Nina replied.
<p>Jim smiled and they paddled silently for a moment.
<p>"This is hard work, aren't you tired?"&nbsp; He obviously meant the
swimming.
<p>Nina laughed.&nbsp; "Not at all.&nbsp; But if you are, we can go back."
<p>Jim looked over at the shoreline where the others were congregated.&nbsp;
Kelly was easy to pick out, laughing hysterically as she was picked up
by a couple of the guys and thrown into the water.
<p>"Tell you what; come with me," he said.
<p>Jim began to swim toward the opposite shore and Nina followed.&nbsp;
He climbed out of the water and turned to watch as Nina did the same.&nbsp;
He admired her form as she stepped from the water; her hair a wet rope
down her back, her skin glistening with the moisture, a Goddess.
<p>Nina observed his very frank appraisal and blushed.&nbsp; It was funny,
but while other men looking at her sometimes made her angry, she could
do nothing but get embarrassed when Jim did it...or was it embarrassed?&nbsp;
It was certainly something!
<p>Jim smiled, noting how she blushed.&nbsp; "This way," he said, holding
out his hand.&nbsp; Nina took it and they began to walk along a dirt path
that wound among the trees.&nbsp; At one point, Jim stopped and casually
slipped out of his swim trunks.
<p>"What are you doing?" Nina asked, quite startled at seeing him naked.
<p>"I thought you might be more comfortable if we were both nude," Jim
said with a smile.
<p>"I'm not," Nina said, wondering what his intentions were and wondering
if it was good or bad.
<p>Jim laughed and draped his wet shorts over a bush.&nbsp; He then continued
down the path with Nina at his side.
<p>It was a surreal moment for Nina, walking through the trees completely
nude with a man who also was completely nude.&nbsp; The feeling of being
back to nature, of shedding all that she had come to know as normal, was
very strong.&nbsp; It was just her and him.&nbsp; She couldn't help feeling
some sexual tension in the air, though.&nbsp; She wasn't used to spending
time naked with a naked man without sex being a part of it, yet she also
felt foolish in assuming that Jim's intentions were sexual.&nbsp; She couldn't
figure him out yet.&nbsp; But there was also that hidden urge she didn't
want to admit yet.
<p>Nina also kept glancing over at Jim's naked body, her eyes drawn to
what had been hidden under his swim trunks until now.&nbsp; Her thoughts
at this point were a jumble, and she blushed deeply when Jim caught her
staring.
<p>"Here we are," he said, pushing his way through some bushes, and Nina
followed until her breath was taken away.&nbsp; They had come out on one
side of the slope, and before them was a wonderful view of the central
valley that ran through these hills.&nbsp; Far below them was the highway
Nina and Kelly had driven along, but apart from the occasional car there
was nothing man-made to be seen.
<p>Jim smiled and sat down on a smooth log.&nbsp; "Come," he said, and
Nina went over to him.&nbsp; She sat next to him, and he put his arm about
her, holding her close.&nbsp; Nina was aware of the skin-to-skin contact;
the way their bare hips touched, the warmth of his body, and the firm grip
of his arm about her.&nbsp; She looked up into his face and was once more
caught up in his eyes.
<p>"This is one of my favorite spots in the world," he said, his voice
barely above a whisper.&nbsp; "I come here often to think, to relax.&nbsp;
I don't often bring people here, but I thought you might appreciate the
beauty of it."
<p>"It's lovely," she said, looking nowhere but at him.
<p>"So are you," he replied, and he bent low and kissed her.
<p>Nina almost pulled away, but didn't; and then moved into the kiss a
little more.&nbsp; Her arms snaked around him and she turned to hold him
to her.&nbsp; She had been afraid that a moment like this would come, especially
once he removed his shorts, and wondered how she would react.&nbsp; But
the stiffening of her nipples and the heat between her legs was reaction
enough, and Nina, frustrated over her exposure ever since coming to live
with Brian Cook, went with it.
<p>Very gently, a surprised and grateful Jim slid the couple off the log
and onto the soft grass, and the two made slow, passionate love.
<p>---***---
<p>"Why do you do it?" Nina asked him a while later.
<p>"What?" Jim said.
<p>The couple was lying side by side on their backs, holding hands and
staring at the sky.&nbsp; They were both enjoying the afterglow from their
lovemaking and had fallen into a companionable silence.&nbsp; But Nina
had finally broken it.
<p>"Do what?" Jim asked.
<p>Nina hesitated, wishing she hadn't voiced the thought that had popped
into her head.
<p>"Er...Kelly.&nbsp; She's told me about some of the...things she has
done.&nbsp; The...dares, games, whatever you call them.&nbsp; You seem
to enjoy putting her in positions where she...well...you know."
<p>Nina turned her head to see Jim looking at her, his expression calm.
<p>"And you want to know why I do it?" he asked.
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>"Have you ever asked Kelly why SHE does it?" he said to her, turning
onto his side.
<p>Nina glanced down his body, aware of him next to her on many different
levels, the memory of him inside her near the top of her mind.
<p>"Er...well.&nbsp; Sometimes you don't really give her a choice, do you?&nbsp;
Like the time you wouldn't let us have our car keys back that night we
first met."
<p>"True, but I pick and choose those moments very carefully."
<p>"But why?&nbsp; What kind of kick do you get playing those games with
her?" Nina asked, really wanting to know.
<p>She watched Jim think about it for a moment, and wondered if he knew
himself why he did it.
<p>"I don't think there is any one reason," he said after a moment, and
he reached out to trace her bare hip with one finger.&nbsp; "I think it's
partly giving Kelly what SHE wants, and partly knowing that she is bound
to a course of action that I set for her with little choice on her part.&nbsp;
But I know she enjoys it; the thrill of doing what few others could do,
the excitement of being stuck naked in a situation not of her own making.&nbsp;
It's what she gets off on, and I'm happy to help her out!"
<p>Nina began to squirm a little as Jim's finger traveled further and further
from her hip.&nbsp; She closed her eyes.&nbsp; "I can't see how she could
enjoy it," she said.
<p>Jim chuckled, not believing her, for Kelly had told him a few things
about Nina and her adventures to date.
<p>"Maybe you just have to give it a shot sometime," he suggested to see
how she would react.
<p>Nina opened her eyes.&nbsp; "Oh no!&nbsp; That run around the block
was plenty for me!"
<p>Jim laughed and moved closer, swinging a leg across her hips.&nbsp;
"Well, I guess we can talk about this later," he said, and his lips found
hers.
<p>Nina agreed, later would be a lot better.
<p>---***---
<p>They swam back to the group, Jim back in his shorts.&nbsp; Nina took
the opportunity while in the water to wash the more obvious remnants of
their lovemaking from her body, but the knowing looks they got from most
of the group showed her that what she and Jim had been doing was probably
no secret.
<p>By the time Nina walked out of the water, she was blushing furiously,
and saw many a suggestive smile aimed at her and Jim.&nbsp; She looked
over at him, expecting to see a big "Yep, I laid her" smile on his face,
but instead he was looking only at her, his expression supportive and a
little embarrassed as well.&nbsp; Nina was happy he wasn't the bragging
type, or at least had the sense not to do it openly.
<p>The couple rejoined the group, and Nina found herself shanghaied by
Kelly, who wanted to know all the details.
<p>Nina didn't give her any.
<p>Eventually everyone drifted over to where a campfire had been lit, and
conversation flowed.&nbsp; But when it began to lag, that's when Nina felt
the day turn.
<p>Jim was watching Nina, and she could feel his gaze upon her even when
she wasn't looking at him.&nbsp; They were across the fire from each other,
but Nina could feel him all the same.
<p>Then she got a shock, for Jim had lifted his right hand a little.&nbsp;
Visibly dangling from one of his fingers were the keys to Kelly's car.
<p>"Oh no," Nina said quietly, knowing that Jim had something planned and
that SHE was to be a part of that plan.&nbsp; If only she hadn't brought
the subject up.&nbsp; It didn't occur to Nina that maybe if she refused
enough, then Jim wouldn't hold her to anything.
<p>"What?" Kelly asked; she was sitting next to Nina.
<p>Nina inclined her head toward Jim, and Kelly saw the car keys.&nbsp;
Instead of feeling dread like Nina, Kelly smiled.&nbsp; "Good, I was hoping.&nbsp;
This will be fun!"
<p>Nina looked at Kelly like she was mad.
<p>Others in the group also began to notice the keys, and soon everyone
fell silent, knowing what was coming.&nbsp; A few suspected that maybe
Nina would be a part of it as well.
<p>"What shall we do with you this afternoon, Kelly?" Jim asked with a
smile.
<p>Kelly grinned back and a few of the others made a few suggestions, some
of them a little lewd, which earned them a stuck out tongue from the intended
victim.
<p>Nina was the only one not in a happy mood, but she was relieved that
Jim had singled out Kelly.
<p>"Some good ideas there," Jim said with a nod or two, "but I was thinking
something bigger."
<p>"Walkabout," someone said, and Jim smiled.
<p>"Yes, walkabout," he answered.
<p>"What's walkabout?" Nina asked.
<p>"It's a walk, a long one.&nbsp; In public, no hiding," said Kelly with
a grin.
<p>"What?" Nina said.&nbsp; "I don't believe that.&nbsp; They want you
to walk around in public?&nbsp; You'll get arrested for sure!"
<p>Jim stood up.&nbsp; "It's not quite what you think, Nina," he said.&nbsp;
"In fact, if we do it right, no one will be able to tell that you and Kelly
are nude.&nbsp; They might suspect, but they won't know for sure."
<p>Nina's heart almost stopped and she heard soft laughter coming from
the others.&nbsp; "What do you mean, me and Kelly?&nbsp; I'm not going
to do it!"
<p>Jim just smiled.&nbsp; "Don't you want to know how?"
<p>"No..." Nina said.&nbsp; But a part of her did want to know, curious
in spite of herself.
<p>"Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.&nbsp; Body paint."
<p>"Body paint?"
<p>Kelly giggled and jumped to her feet, a few others standing as well.&nbsp;
"Oh COOL!&nbsp; I haven't done that in a while.&nbsp; Oh, Nina, you HAVE
to try this!"
<p>Kelly reached down and took Nina's hands, hauling the girl to her feet.
<p>"I'm not sure I understand," Nina said.
<p>"It's body paint," Kelly said enthusiastically.&nbsp; "Instead of wearing
clothes, you get an outfit painted directly on you.&nbsp; You're still
naked, but anyone looking at you won't be able to tell."
<p>"Sure they could tell; how could they not?" Nina said slowly.
<p>"Believe me.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; I've done it before.&nbsp; Marcia
over there is really good at painting, and so is Arney," Kelly said, pointing
at a couple who smiled back.
<p>"I don't know.&nbsp; I don't think I want to do this," Nina replied.
<p>Jim stepped forward.&nbsp; "Tell you what, Nina.&nbsp; How about we
paint up Kelly first so you can see how she looks?&nbsp; Then you decide."&nbsp;
He put his hands on her shoulders, and the nude young woman was instantly
captivated by his eyes.&nbsp; She bit her lower lip and nodded.
<p>Jim smiled an encouraging smile.&nbsp; "Good girl.&nbsp; Okay guys,
let's get to it, daylight's burning!"
<p>Kelly squealed in excitement and ran into the house, while Marcia and
Arney went to their car for the paints.&nbsp; The rest of the group either
helped to clear an area for the painting to be done, or fetched themselves
some more beer.
<p>Marcia and Arney were ready first, and the reason for Kelly's tardiness
was apparent the moment she reappeared on the back deck.&nbsp; She had
gone inside to shave her pubes.
<p>"Oh...my...God," Nina said, "I don't have to do that, do I?"
<p>Jim looked down.&nbsp; Nina kept herself well trimmed because of all
the time she spent nude, but he knew that she had too much hair for it
to work properly.&nbsp; "Maybe, but let's see later," he whispered, not
wanting to scare her off.
<p>Kelly came forth, not embarrassed at all about the further lack of covering
that she had, and positioned herself the way the two body artists wanted
her.&nbsp; Everyone settled back to watch the half hour process.
<p>It was obvious to Nina that Marcia and Arney had done this before...a
lot, and at one point Jim leaned in close to her and told her that the
couple worked at the Buffalo resort and did body painting classes.&nbsp;
Nina just nodded and watched in amazement at what they were doing to Kelly.&nbsp;
Nina had expected them to just paint her body, covering up all the naughty
bits.&nbsp; But the couple went further.&nbsp; They started with a basic
foundation that reminded Nina of black bicycle shorts and a red tank top,
but they didn't stop there.&nbsp; On top of that, Marcia and Arney painted
detail and a design.&nbsp; What had been a plain black surface now sported
seams and creases, making her pseudo pants look like real pants.&nbsp;
Her top was transformed from plain red to one decorated in vines and flowers.&nbsp;
All this detail hid the natural lines of Kelly's breasts and groin, and
Nina had to admit that from only a few steps away, she had to look hard
to see that it wasn't real.
<p>"Isn't this great?" Kelly said, looking at herself and grinning.&nbsp;
"I wish I could do this for myself; I'd always wear clothes like this!"
<p>The others laughed, and Jim took Nina's hand.&nbsp; "Well?" he asked.
<p>Nina took a deep breath.&nbsp; She could feel the others watching her,
expecting her to go ahead.&nbsp; Few of them were strangers now, as if
anyone who saw her naked could be considered a stranger.&nbsp; But she
had talked to most of them one on one and formed loose friendships.&nbsp;
She felt a part of the group, which made it even worse.&nbsp; How could
she say no, especially after seeing the job done on Kelly?
<p>"Can you tell me where we're going first?" Nina asked, swallowing.
<p>"There is a small town about twenty minutes away.&nbsp; We'll just be
walking through it, one end to the other.&nbsp; You won't be alone; we'll
be there with you both," Jim said softly.
<p>Nina took a deep breath, then nodded, her heart thumping.
<p>Jim smiled, and led her to Marcia.&nbsp; But Marcia shook her head.&nbsp;
"She'll have to shave; she's the wrong shape for doing it with hair."
<p>"No!" Nina said.
<p>"You'll have to," Marcia said firmly.
<p>Nina turned to Jim, who took her in his arms.&nbsp; "It'll be okay,
you can do this."
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "Okay."
<p>Kelly grinned and bounded up to Nina like a happy puppy.&nbsp; "There's
stuff inside you can use; come on, I'll show you."
<p>Ten minutes later, Kelly, followed by a very red faced Nina, appeared
at the back door of the cabin.&nbsp; Nina could hardly step outside the
door; she felt even more naked than before.&nbsp; But the encouraging smiles
of the group helped her get over her initial nervousness and she obediently
took her place, ready to be painted.
<p>"I'll have an overcoat and long pants, please," she said nervously,
making everyone laugh.
<p>Marcia grinned.&nbsp; "Relax, you'll be fine."
<p>Nina nodded and closed her eyes.&nbsp; She didn't open them, but she
knew where they were working all the same.&nbsp; The feel of the paint
being applied to her skin was unique, and at times a little ticklish.&nbsp;
She wondered what it was they were doing to her, and thought that they
hadn't quite given her the coverage they had given Kelly.&nbsp; But they
certainly spent a lot of time on her breasts and groin, so Nina was sure
the detail would be there.
<p>"Okay, it's done," she heard Jim say, so she opened her eyes and looked
down.
<p>What she saw stunned her, and didn't look that real from so close up.&nbsp;
But the longer she looked at it, the more she could see how the details
hid the fact that she was really naked.&nbsp; What Marcia and Arney had
done with her was to paint on shorts and a bikini top.&nbsp; The shorts
looked like denim, cut high on her hips, revealing the lower half of her
butt cheeks.&nbsp; The bikini top was done in a matching blue, with a large
yellow flower centered over her nipples.&nbsp; There were even straps for
the top painted up around her neck and behind her back.
<p>All in all, it was an outfit Nina would never have gone out with in
reality, but considering the alternative, it was better than nothing at
all.
<p>"We had to go with the denim shorts," Marcia said, "because your pubic
area is rather prominent.&nbsp; The front fly we painted on you should
hide that well enough, though."
<p>Nina blushed furiously at being told that her pussy was very visible,
as if she didn't know.&nbsp; Without pubic hair, she felt completely bald
and vulnerable, and almost decided to stop right there, but Kelly prevented
her.
<p>"You look great!" Kelly said, and the others echoed the sentiment.
<p>Nina just nodded and tried to smile, but her eyes sought out Jim.&nbsp;
When she saw him, she saw he was staring at her in rapt fascination, which
made her continue to blush quite strongly.
<p>"Beautiful," he said.
<p>"Let's go, let's go!" Kelly called out, and the group began to move.
<p>Nina moved slowly, not believing what she was about to do.&nbsp; Walk
through a town completely naked except for a VERY thin layer of paint.&nbsp;
She thought herself crazy, and concocted a dozen reasons why she couldn't
do it.&nbsp; Yet not one of them made it to her lips.
<p>Kelly and Nina rode with Jim in his truck, the others piling into other
vehicles, some of them in Kelly's car, and the entire group headed out.&nbsp;
It really was only about a twenty-minute drive, and throughout it all,
Nina was still very aware that, despite the way she looked, she was STILL
naked.&nbsp; Nina looked over at Kelly who was bouncing up and down like
a two-year-old.&nbsp; Nina wondered how Kelly could be so excited by all
this.&nbsp; Nina was terrified, herself.
<p>Getting to the town, Nina had her next surprise.&nbsp; She had envisioned
a little hamlet, one main road with maybe one or two cars on it.&nbsp;
Well the town DID have one main road, but plunked down right on top of
it was one of those traveling carnivals.&nbsp; Apparently, according to
the signs plastered all over the place, the town was celebrating its centennial,
and it was crowded.
<p>"No," Nina said, dismayed by the sight.
<p>"It's okay, Nina," Jim told her.
<p>Nina turned to look at him.&nbsp; "How can you say it's okay?&nbsp;
Can you SEE the crowds?"
<p>"It's better this way," he replied.&nbsp; "Think about it.&nbsp; If
this were a quiet town, everyone would notice you walking down the street.&nbsp;
But look, right now there are so many people I doubt anyone would even
look at you!"&nbsp; Jim doubted that, considering how attractive Nina was,
but he wanted to bolster her spirits.&nbsp; "Beside, look at what they
are wearing."
<p>Nina looked, and slowly understood.&nbsp; The crowd was dressed very
casually, with lots of skin and half worn swimsuits mixing in with the
regular clothing.&nbsp; Nina saw that a number of people were showing even
more skin than she was if her outfit had been real.&nbsp; But Nina knew
that despite the skimpy attire, what these people wore was REAL.
<p>"I don't know," Nina said nervously.
<p>"I'll be right with you.&nbsp; All we do is get out of the car and walk
through the crowd to the other side of town.&nbsp; Okay?"
<p>Nina took a deep breath, then nodded.
<p>"YAY!" Kelly said.&nbsp; "Let's GO!"
<p>Kelly opened her door and jumped out of the truck, and with a silent
prayer, Nina joined her.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the other members
of the group stood around them, Nina was very conscious of the fact that
she was now standing in front of several hundred people without a stitch
on.&nbsp; She felt a hand touch her bare butt cheek and whirled to find
Marcia looked at her.
<p>"Just checking to make sure none of the paint rubbed off.&nbsp; You're
fine," she said.
<p>"How does this stuff come off, anyway," Nina asked.
<p>"Water will do it, so don't get wet."&nbsp; Marcia grinned and went
to check Kelly.
<p>Nina swallowed.
<p>"There will be a car waiting for us on the other side," Jim said and
he took Nina's hand.&nbsp; "Let's go."
<p>They walked slowly, Nina and Jim in the center of the group while the
more adventurous Kelly kept to the front.&nbsp; Every step they took made
Nina want to bolt, to run as fast as she could to safety, but she knew
that would draw even more attention to herself than what she was doing
now.&nbsp; As it was, Nina was aware of very eye, every look the crowd
gave her.&nbsp; She knew that all these people were seeing her naked body,
her breasts, her bare pussy, her butt, even though they did not realize
it themselves.&nbsp; Her heart thumped heavily in her chest and fear flowed
through her veins.&nbsp; Yet at the same time, she DID feel excited.&nbsp;
Her excitement growing the longer they walked, the longer they went without
anyone yelling, "Hey, SHE'S NAKED!"&nbsp; Maybe there was something to
this after all!
<p>At one point, while walking through the midway, Jim suggested stopping
to play a few games, maybe do a few rides.&nbsp; Nina just glared at him
and he laughed, letting her know he was just teasing.&nbsp; Someone else
suggested that Nina or Kelly take a turn in the dunk tank, which made everyone
laugh, before someone had to restrain Kelly from almost trying it.
<p>It was the longest walk of Nina's life, she thought, but they eventually
made it to the end.&nbsp; Grateful, she climbed into Jim's truck, which
someone had brought around.&nbsp; She was exhausted from the tension.
<p>"Have fun?" Jim asked, climbing in beside her.&nbsp; In response, Nina
leaned over and kissed him.
<p>"That was very intense, but I'm glad it's over," she said to him.
<p>Jim smiled.&nbsp; "Er...not quite."
<p>Kelly climbed in and Jim started the truck and pulled away.
<p>"What do you mean, not quite.&nbsp; I did what you asked!" Nina said,
feeling a little betrayed.
<p>"I know, Nina, and you did great, better than I thought you would.&nbsp;
Had you run into problems, I wouldn't go on, but there is a traditional
end to a body painting dare, right Kel'?"
<p>"Right," Kelly said with a smile.&nbsp; "Don't worry Nina, it'll be
fun, and over in a flash!"
<p>Nina sat back, wondering if it would ever end.&nbsp; "This is it right?&nbsp;
No more games after this?"
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "No more.&nbsp; My word on that."
<p>"Okay," Nina sighed, figuring she might as well go along.&nbsp; She
couldn't be more embarrassed than she was right now anyway.
<p>They drove for about fifteen minutes, and Nina saw they were heading
for the coast.&nbsp; They pulled into a small coastal town and parked in
a public lot next to the beach.&nbsp; Nina noticed that someone had followed
them in Kelly's car, while the rest of the group had probably gone back
to the lake or gone home.&nbsp; Nina looked around and saw that while the
beach didn't have near the crowds of the carnival, there were still many
people about.
<p>"Okay, here's the deal," Jim said.&nbsp; "You guys get out and head
for the water.&nbsp; Go for a swim and wash off the paint on your bodies.&nbsp;
Once I see you swimming, I drive off, leaving your car keys in the ignition
of your car.&nbsp; You then have to run back to your car."
<p>"You're kidding!" Nina said.
<p>"He isn't," Kelly answered.
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "If you don't go in the water, then I take off with
your keys, leaving you both here.&nbsp; Those paint jobs might last to
get you both home without a car, but do you want to take the risk?"
<p>Nina just stared at him.
<p>"Come on, Nina," Kelly said.&nbsp; "Like I said, it'll be quick and
easy.&nbsp; Just a run up the beach to the car and we're off.&nbsp; Nothing
to it."
<p>Nina just looked at Jim a moment longer, before turning and sighing.&nbsp;
"Okay."
<p>Kelly grinned and again climbed out of the truck.&nbsp; Nina turned
to look at Jim again, who gave her an encouraging smile, but without a
word, she slipped out.
<p>She followed Kelly onto the sand, again very aware of the fact that
she was nude around all these dressed people, but not really caring at
the moment.&nbsp; She was thinking about Jim, and his perverse sense of
fun.&nbsp; Would knowing him be nothing but a continuous string of these
games?&nbsp; As she wandered into the water, Nina thought about the lovemaking
she and Jim had enjoyed.&nbsp; THAT Jim had seemed tender, loving, and
concerned about her, but THIS Jim seemed like a completely different guy.
<p>Again, Nina found solace in the water, and she struck out in powerful
strokes, leaving the land and all its troubles behind.&nbsp; The feel of
water flowing over her naked skin was so familiar to her now that she almost
forgot her nudity, but when she turned and looked down at herself, she
could see that already most of the paint that had been delicately placed
on her had washed away.
<p>Nina looked at the beach and saw Jim and his friend standing next to
their vehicles.&nbsp; Jim waved, and the two guys climbed into the truck,
leaving Kelly's little Geo all alone.&nbsp; Nina wondered if Jim had done
what he promised to do, leave the keys behind.&nbsp; Somehow, Nina wouldn't
put it past him to strand him and Kelly here naked with no way of getting
home.
<p>"You ready?"&nbsp; Kelly asked, swimming up to her.
<p>Nina waited a beat, then nodded, her face set.
<p>The two women swam for shore, staying in the water as long as they could.&nbsp;
Then with a yell, Kelly jumped up and waded the last few feet to shore.
<p>Nina was hard pressed to keep up, but she managed to stay right behind
the nude nymph, yelling as SHE ran as well.&nbsp; People around them got
the surprise of their lives as they watched these two naked women run screaming
across the beach.&nbsp; No one had noticed where they came from, but most
appreciated the sight, for whistles and shouts of encouragements followed
them all the way to their car.
<p>Like the "Duke Boys," Kelly and Nina leapt into the Geo without opening
the doors, and with a roar, Kelly got the car started.&nbsp; The last thing
the beach people saw was the two of them driving away, both laughing their
heads off.
<p>"I can't believe I just did that!" yelled Nina, still laughing and surprised
she was doing so.&nbsp; Up until the point she left the water, she thought
she could do anything but laugh.&nbsp; But the exposure and the run had
been a rush, washing through her and purging her of her tension and worry.&nbsp;
It was amazing.
<p>"Don't tell me you didn't like THAT!" Kelly said to her.
<p>Nina blushed.&nbsp; "Well..."
<p>Kelly laughed again.&nbsp; "We'll make a streaker out of you yet.&nbsp;
Now, where are we going?"
<p>"What do you mean?" Nina asked.
<p>"I can either drive us home, or back to Jim and the group at the lake.&nbsp;
It's going to be an all night party.&nbsp; You game?"
<p>Nina thought about it for just a minute.&nbsp; Home and safety, or yet
more hours nude with Jim and his friends.
<p>"The lake," she said firmly after a moment, thinking of the possibility
of a late night walk with Jim.
<p>Kelly grinned, and the two nude young women went back to the hills.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 17, Moving Day.
<p>It was a bright and sunny Saturday after two nights of dreadful storms.&nbsp;
The air felt warm and clean and the world shone with an unexpected newness.
<p>Enjoying the sun and the heat were two young women.&nbsp; Both were
lying on canvas covered patio lounges, stretched out to maximize the amount
of exposure to the morning rays.&nbsp; Both had barely moved a muscle over
the past half hour, so relaxed were they, except of course for their mouths
as they chatted about this and that.&nbsp; And both were liberally coated
in suntan lotion to protect against burning.&nbsp; There was a rather obvious
difference between the two, though.&nbsp; One lay in a modest bikini while
the other was nude.&nbsp; The nude wasn't nude entirely by choice; she
could, if she wished, have gotten dressed any time she wanted.&nbsp; But
the girl in question, Nina West, was not about to do that, for to put on
any clothing unless she was leaving the property was a violation of her
lease.&nbsp; Nina West had a rather unusual arrangement with her landlord,
Brian Cook.&nbsp; She had free room and board for two years, as long as
she remained nude on the property at all times unless he said otherwise.&nbsp;
He rarely said otherwise.
<p>At first, it had been very hard for young Nina to spend all that time
nude, but she had been here for a while now and didn't find it near the
chore that it had been...at least for the most part...at least when alone.
<p>She wasn't alone now, but with her was one of the few people who didn't
make her self conscious about her nudity, her friend Helen.&nbsp; In fact,
there had been a few odd moments when Helen had joined Nina in being nude,
but for the most part, she stayed dressed.&nbsp; Just like this morning.
<p>Helen had stopped by rather unexpectedly that morning, but Nina was
happy for the company.&nbsp; Nina didn't live alone.&nbsp; Brian, her landlord,
Mrs. Terry, his housekeeper, and Kelly, his grand daughter, all lived in
the huge house as well.&nbsp; But Brian was an old man, Mrs. Terry was
aloof, and Kelly...well Kelly was still a mystery to Nina in many respects.&nbsp;
Helen, who Nina met at work, was the only real friend she had made since
moving out here, the only one she could really talk to.
<p>So Nina was glad Helen had stopped by, but couldn't help wondering why
she had.&nbsp; Helen rarely did anything without a good reason, and she
had said nothing about coming over when she and Nina were at work the day
before.
<p>Nina, who was lying on her stomach, turned to look at her friend.&nbsp;
They had talked about a few things, mostly work related, but Nina thought
that Helen had something on her mind, maybe the reason for her coming over.&nbsp;
As Nina watched and wondered, Helen looked up and around at the windows
of the house overlooking the patio before reaching behind herself and undoing
the catch of her bikini top.&nbsp; Lying on her front, she was now able
to tan her back without a line, well not much of one.&nbsp; A faint tan
line was already there.
<p>Nina smiled, both at the modesty Helen displayed despite the fact that
she was spending time with a nude woman, and also at the knowledge that
being nude all the time meant she had NO tan lines.
<p>Comfortable enough in their friendship not to need conversation as a
crutch, Nina and Helen lay silently for awhile, both just enjoying the
sun and both busy with their own thoughts.&nbsp; It was Helen that eventually
broke the silence.
<p>"I got some bad news today," she said.
<p>Nina was suddenly concerned.&nbsp; She rose up on her elbows, her naked
breasts now hanging.&nbsp; "What is it?"
<p>Helen glanced over briefly before looking away.&nbsp; Her sunglasses
hid her eyes or Nina would have seen her take in the sight of Nina half
propped up, especially how she zeroed in on Nina's bare breasts.&nbsp;
Helen felt embarrassed at how she couldn't help looking at Nina, and wished
she could stop.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and answered her friend.
<p>"It's nothing serious, just sudden.&nbsp; I'm kinda embarrassed about
making such a big deal out of it.&nbsp; It's nothing really," Helen said.
<p>"Well, let me be the judge of that," Nina said with a smile.
<p>Helen gave a soft smile as well.&nbsp; "Okay.&nbsp; I got a notice from
our landlord today; the City served a Notice on HIM, citing him for fire
code violations.&nbsp; So he has to get them fixed and in a hurry.&nbsp;
He told us that he needed all the tenants out of the building for a week
so his builders could get to work.&nbsp; My roommates are all getting hotel
rooms for the week, but you know I've been saving for that ski trip, and
the price of hotel rooms in this town is like everything else, expensive
to the max.&nbsp; I was hoping that...well, wondering if I could stay here
with you!"
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "Of course you can, but I'm not the one to ask.&nbsp;
I think you'd have to talk to Brian.&nbsp; I don't see any reason why you
couldn't stay for a week, though.&nbsp; When do you have to move out?"
<p>"Er...by tonight," said Helen weakly.
<p>"Tonight!" Nina exclaimed.
<p>"Yeah, the builders start tomorrow, early.&nbsp; Kinda sudden, huh?"&nbsp;
Helen shrugged.
<p>"No kidding," Nina said, wondering how Brian Cook would take having
a new houseguest at such short notice.
<p>"Do you think he'd go for it?" Helen said, wondering about Nina's host.
<p>"Well, let's go see!"&nbsp; Nina sat up and climbed out of the lounger.&nbsp;
She had to wait a moment while Helen refastened her top before getting
off her chair, and again Nina smiled.&nbsp; Nina and Helen had recently
spent an entire working weekend together where they hardly wore a stitch
of clothing between them, yet Helen was still very modest around her.&nbsp;
Eventually Helen was ready, and both women, one nude and one in just a
bikini, made their way into the house.
<p>They passed through the kitchen, normally Mrs. Terry's domain, and both
women wondered where the housekeeper was.&nbsp; She was easy to find though,
for all they had to do was follow the sound of a vacuum cleaner echoing
through the house.&nbsp; As they walked, Helen felt rather self conscious,
her bikini clad image reflected all over the place.&nbsp; The inside of
the house was liberally coated with mirrors, taking up most of the wall
space that wasn't windows.&nbsp; To be sure though, there wasn't much that
wasn't open or a window.&nbsp; The house was the pinnacle of open planning,
at least on the first floor.&nbsp; Huge windows let in the great outdoors,
making it easy for anyone standing outside to see anyone inside, something
that made Nina very nervous due to her nudity.
<p>With all the mirrors, it was worse; for you couldn't turn around without
seeing yourself, and neither could anyone else.&nbsp; Therefore, the two
young women saw Mrs. Terry vacuuming a rug long before they entered the
room where she was working, and to Helen it was still a very unusual sight.
<p>Mrs. Terry was a nudist; it was her preferred manner of dress, and her
employer had no arguments against it.&nbsp; In fact, Mrs. Terry had revealed
to Nina one evening that she had once served the same modeling role for
Brian Cook that Nina now did, and that was what turned her on to being
nude.&nbsp; So it was not surprising to see the older woman stark naked
as she did her chores, including doing the vacuuming.
<p>Nina got her attention by waving, and Mrs. Terry shut off the vacuum
cleaner and stretched.&nbsp; She looked at the two young women with a half
smile showing on her normally dour face.
<p>"Did you need something, Miss West?" the housekeeper said.
<p>"I was just wondering where Brian was, and if he would mind if we saw
him," Nina replied, knowing her host enjoyed his privacy on occasion.
<p>"I think I just saw Mr. Cook go into his studio, Miss West.&nbsp; He
didn't say anything to me about not wanting visitors, but knock first."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Nina said with a smile, and she led her friend upstairs.
<p>As they walked up the open staircase, Helen hugged herself.&nbsp; "Maybe
I should put something else on," she said.&nbsp; "It feels very odd calling
on someone wearing just a swimsuit."
<p>"You should try it nude sometime," teased Nina.
<p>Helen shuddered.
<p>Brian Cook, a lawyer retired from the firm where Nina worked, was now
a sculptor.&nbsp; This was why the old man wanted Nina nude all the time,
to be his living model.&nbsp; Brian's art was concentrated on the expressions
of modesty, revealed as moments of embarrassment and humiliation in the
human body.&nbsp; Having a model always nude allowed him to see those moments
in a realistic way he could never hope to duplicate with a pose in his
studio.&nbsp; Consequently, Nina didn't spend much time actually modeling
for Brian.&nbsp; It had been a week since she was last in the studio.&nbsp;
She knocked.
<p>"Yes!" said a voice from inside.
<p>"It's Nina; can I come in?"
<p>"You have your friend Helen with you, don't you?"
<p>"Yes," Nina replied.
<p>"Just one moment then."
<p>Helen looked at her friend and raised an eyebrow.
<p>Nina giggled.&nbsp; "He's probably covering up my statue.&nbsp; He doesn't
want anyone to see it before the unveiling Wednesday night."
<p>"Oh, have you seen it?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina nodded, and blushed at the thought.&nbsp; She had sat-or more accurately,
stood-for a few basic posing sessions once Brian had settled on the image
he wanted to portray.&nbsp; But the detail work had been done strictly
from his observations of Nina as she lived in his house.&nbsp; Nina had
seen the almost completed work the week before, and knew that the detail
was indeed exquisite.&nbsp; Frightening, even.
<p>"Is it any good?" Helen asked with a smile, knowing how her friend thought
about being immortalized nude in stone.
<p>Nina sniffed and grinned.&nbsp; "You'll just have to wait to see for
yourself."
<p>"COME!" yelled a voice from inside the door, and the two women entered.
<p>There was indeed a cloth-covered mound standing on a workbench on one
side of the room.&nbsp; It looked pretty short to Helen, but that was because
the statue wasn't life size.&nbsp; It didn't need to be, Nina knew; as
small as it was, it was detailed enough.
<p>Brian was washing some of his tools at a nearby sink.&nbsp; The old
man was dressed in jeans and a slightly ripped T-shirt, so unlike the corporate
image of the lawyer he used to be.
<p>He looked up at the approaching girls and smiled in a grandfatherly
way.&nbsp; Brian had gotten to know Nina fairly well during the time she
had lived here, and he liked her friend Helen as well.&nbsp; He was amused
to note though, that while it was Nina who was nude, it was Helen who blushed
at appearing before him so scantily dressed.&nbsp; He made a mental note
of her expression.
<p>"What can I do for you young ladies this morning?" he asked.&nbsp; "Do
you need to get at some clothing, Nina?"
<p>Brian held the keys to where Nina's clothes were kept locked up.&nbsp;
Any time she wanted some so she could leave, she had to ask Brian.
<p>"No," Nina said, still not quite used to refusing an offering of clothing,
"I'm not going anywhere just yet, but we wanted to ask you something."
<p>Brian inclined his head in an inquisitive manner, and Nina explained
Helen's predicament and her need to stay.&nbsp; Through it all, Helen stayed
silent, biting her lip, aware of how little she wore.&nbsp; She also kept
glancing down between Nina's legs, to where a recent shave was only now
growing back.
<p>"Hmmm," Brian said when Nina was done.&nbsp; "The man gave you no notice
whatsoever?" he asked Helen.
<p>"What?&nbsp; Oh, no.&nbsp; Just told us this morning that the builders
would be by tomorrow, and that we would have to find someplace else to
stay for a week."
<p>Brian shook his head.&nbsp; "I hope at least that he will refund you
your expenses."
<p>"He didn't say anything about it," Helen answered.
<p>Brian knew that the landlord had overstepped his bounds, but that wasn't
the issue here.&nbsp; He took a moment to think about it, and decided to
explore an option.&nbsp; If Helen hadn't just blushed the way she had,
Brian doubted he would have thought of what he did just now.&nbsp; But
Nina had adjusted very quickly to her nude state, and it wasn't as easy
to catch her embarrassed about it as it used to be.&nbsp; Brian regarded
Helen carefully.
<p>"Alright," he said after a moment, "You can stay until you are able
to move back in to your home."
<p>The two young women cheered and almost shared a hug, shying away at
the last second.
<p>"But," he continued, "as I told Nina, no one gets something for nothing.&nbsp;
There will be a rent to pay."
<p>Helen paled.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina could see that Helen was angry.&nbsp; The young woman was now fully
dressed in shorts and a blouse, put on over her swimsuit.&nbsp; She threw
her handbag in her car and climbed in after it.
<p>"How dare he!" she kept saying.
<p>"Helen, I'm sorry," Nina said, trying to calm her down.&nbsp; Of course
she was a little angry with Brian herself, angry with him for telling Helen
that the price for her staying was to follow the same rules Nina did.&nbsp;
Nina knew that Helen had every right to be angry.
<p>"I'm not..." Helen began.&nbsp; "I...CAN'T do what he said; I'm not
like you, Nina!&nbsp; I don't know HOW he could have thought that!"
<p>Nina was at a loss for words, she just hoped she hadn't lost a friend.
<p>Helen slouched in the driver's seat for a moment, head and arms on the
steering wheel, before looking up at her naked friend.&nbsp; She looked
very distraught.
<p>"Helen, where will you go now?" Nina asked her.
<p>"I don't know; I'll have to find a place somewhere," she said.
<p>Nina sighed, then grinned.&nbsp; "Maybe Sarah can put you up!"
<p>Helen glared at Nina with a horrified expression.
<p>"No, thank you!" she said strongly.&nbsp; "No doubt I'd lose my clothes
there as well, but at least here I wouldn't be expected to go out to dinner
afterward!"
<p>Nina laughed, and after a moment, Helen did too.&nbsp; Helen was still
upset about Brian's decision...no, his terms.&nbsp; But she didn't see
herself capitulating to them...not unless she really had to.&nbsp; The
thing was, it wasn't so much the nudity she was afraid of but...she looked
away from Nina.
<p>Nina padded forward and leaned against the car.&nbsp; "Well, when you
find a place, let me know, okay?"
<p>"Yeah, I'll call.&nbsp; Thanks anyway."&nbsp; Helen started her little
car and pulled away.&nbsp; Nina watched her go, and went back inside, wondering
how she would have reacted if Helen had said 'Yes'.
<p>---***---
<p>Night had fallen, and Nina was getting worried.&nbsp; No call yet from
Helen.&nbsp; Where was her friend going to spend the night?
<p>She had spent part of the evening watching TV in her room, promos for
an upcoming adult version of "Survivor" making her cringe, when there was
a knock at her door.
<p>"Come in!" Nina yelled, not wanting to move from her comfortable seat.
<p>Mrs. Terry opened the door and poked her head in.
<p>"You have a visitor, Miss West," she said.
<p>Without another word, she opened the door wider and left.&nbsp; Standing
in the door was Helen, looking tired and rather upset.
<p>THIS got Nina out of her chair.&nbsp; "Helen, are you alright?"
<p>Helen nodded and sighed.
<p>"What are you doing here; did you find a place to stay?" Nina asked.
<p>"Nothing that I could afford, not for a week," she replied.&nbsp; "I
could swing it, but I'd be wiped out, and the places I could afford are
so far out of town that I'd spend way too much in gas to make it worth
while."
<p>"Have you been looking all this time?" asked Nina, sorry for her friend.
<p>"I...er, No.&nbsp; It became obvious it was pretty hopeless early on.&nbsp;
I even tried calling a few people, but no one was willing to put me up
for a week."&nbsp; Helen bit her lip and looked Nina straight in the eye.&nbsp;
"I...spent most of the afternoon just sitting...thinking.&nbsp; I can't
live in my car for a week.&nbsp; Do you think...Brian might...?"
<p>Nina sighed and took Helen's hand.&nbsp; "Let's go ask him."
<p>It was late, but not so late that Brian had already gone to bed.&nbsp;
He met them at the door to his private suite of rooms in an expensive looking
robe and pajamas.&nbsp; He raised his eyebrows at the sight of Helen standing
quietly beside his lodger.
<p>"To be honest young lady, I didn't expect to see you here so soon again,"
he said to her.
<p>Helen looked down.
<p>Nina looked from one to the other, and spoke up for her friend.&nbsp;
"She can't find any place to stay.&nbsp; Could she PLEASE stay here?"
<p>"Of course she can, we have another spare bedroom.&nbsp; But she knows
the price," Brian said firmly.
<p>"Oh, come on, Brian, you can't expect her to really abide by those rules.&nbsp;
It seems rather petty of you to even try to enforce them.&nbsp; Why would
you, anyway; isn't that why you have me?" Nina said angrily.
<p>Brian Cook looked at Nina for a moment, his expression thoughtful.
<p>"You know, Nina, your grandfather, God rest his soul, often told me
what a fighter you were.&nbsp; He said that you rarely fought for yourself,
but were always ready to fight for others.&nbsp; It was one of the reasons
he thought you would make a great lawyer, a trial lawyer at that.&nbsp;
I agree with him, by the way.&nbsp; He also told me that you have a great
sense of responsibility; that once given a task or duty, you follow through.&nbsp;
Again, a good quality for a lawyer.
<p>"Those two attributes combined together makes you protective of others,
as I can see right now.&nbsp; This is the first time you have ever yelled
at me, young lady."
<p>"I'm sorry," Nina said, realizing it was true.
<p>"Oh, don't be sorry; there are times you have to stand up for your fellow
man."&nbsp; Brian let a small smile appear on his features.&nbsp; "Or woman
as the case may be."
<p>Both women weren't drawn into that smile.&nbsp; Instead, they stood
and waited.
<p>Brian nodded slowly, as if making up his mind about something.
<p>"Very well, she can stay.&nbsp; BUT there are two conditions, and there
is no negotiating them."
<p>"They are?" Nina asked.
<p>"There is one for each of you, both of which have to be agreed upon."
<p>He turned to Helen.
<p>"Helen, instead of five, or seven, or however many days you are going
to be here, I will insist on your spending 24 hours here on the property
nude as Nina does."
<p>"Wait, I can't..." Helen began but Brian cut her off.
<p>"Stop.&nbsp; Hear me out.&nbsp; These hours will not be all at once,
but spread out throughout your stay, an hour here, an hour there.&nbsp;
I get to say WHEN you are to be nude, but you will not be leaving the property
like that.&nbsp; Can you handle that?"
<p>Helen blinked.&nbsp; She knew it was a vast improvement on the deal
she used to have, even though it still meant her being undressed for him.&nbsp;
Still, it would only be for short periods of time.&nbsp; She could handle
that, couldn't she?
<p>Helen nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, Sir.&nbsp; I can do that.&nbsp; Okay, I agree."
<p>Brian smiled softly and turned to Nina, who stood a little straighter
in preparation for whatever Brian had in mind for her.
<p>Brian's eyes flickered over the nude young woman's body for a second,
and Brian had one of those infrequent thoughts wishing he were thirty years
younger.
<p>"Nina, since you are such a responsible young woman, your side of this
deal is two-fold.&nbsp; First, you are responsible for seeing that our
guest follows the rules.&nbsp; You will see that she undresses and stays
undressed when ordered."
<p>Nina nodded and swallowed, not to happy about being Helen's jailer,
so to speak.&nbsp; She wondered what Helen thought of that, but her friend
didn't look at her.
<p>"Second, young lady.&nbsp; Several friends of mine have asked about
your modeling for them.&nbsp; I've been putting them off to give you time
to settle, but I think you're ready now.&nbsp; You will model for them
whenever they ask, as long as it doesn't intrude on your work at the firm,
or your position here as MY model.&nbsp; You will do as they say and be
respectful of their needs.&nbsp; Oh...don't worry.&nbsp; You will be as
safe with them as you are here; you needn't worry about your virtue, Nina.&nbsp;
I trust them to act professionally, and so can you.&nbsp; Do you agree?"
<p>Nina took a breath, trying to find the hidden catch.&nbsp; She wasn't
really thrilled about being responsible in that way for Helen, but the
idea of being a model wasn't THAT unappealing.&nbsp; She nodded.&nbsp;
"Yes, Sir.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; So she can stay?"
<p>"She can stay.&nbsp; Welcome, Helen.&nbsp; Go talk to Alison and she
can help you make up a room.&nbsp; I'll see you both tomorrow.&nbsp; Good
night."&nbsp; And with that, he stepped back into his room and closed the
door.
<p>Helen turned and silently walked down the hallway to the stairs.
<p>"You okay?" Nina asked, following.
<p>Helen nodded.
<p>"I'm sorry about this.&nbsp; I had hoped we would do better," Nina said.
<p>"It's okay.&nbsp; I can do this.&nbsp; If I can strip at the Legallady's
place, I can do it here as well."
<p>Nina put her arm around her friend, not noticing the shiver it caused.&nbsp;
"You'll be fine.&nbsp; You might even grow to like it.&nbsp; To be honest,
it isn't all that bad now that I'm used to it."
<p>Helen smiled, and the two friends went to find the housekeeper.&nbsp;
It was moving day.

<br>
<p>Part 18, Unveiling.
<p>Tonight, the party was on the patio, and a DJ with a sense of humor
had actually started playing that ZZ Top classic, until someone told him
to stop and get back to the easy listening stuff he was being paid for.
<p>At one end of the patio, on a raised platform, was the statue, still
under its cover, its secrets protected from prying eyes.
<p>Nina wished it would stay that way.&nbsp; There were a lot of people
at the house, most of whom she didn't recognize.&nbsp; Those she DID recognize
were all from the side of her life that knew about her nude lifestyle.
<p>Talking with some people in one corner was Jacob Dah, his booming Scottish
accent occasionally audible over the general throng.
<p>Near the pool stood the Russian artist they had met at Buffalo Beach,
Boris Berednov, the Beard.&nbsp; He looked very different in clothes, quite
attractive Nina thought.&nbsp; Beard was talking with Helen, who was dressed
for the occasion in a single silk wrap about twenty feet long.&nbsp; Gold,
and trimmed in a silver leaf design, it wrapped many times around her body
and over her left shoulder, giving her a definite East Indian appearance.&nbsp;
Nina knew that under it, poor Helen wore nothing at all, not even shoes.&nbsp;
Yet, she didn't act as if she cared about it at that moment, and Nina had
to admit you couldn't really tell that was all she wore.&nbsp; The silk
was sheer, but its many layers gave her visual protection.
<p>Nina looked around some more, smiling a greeting whenever she was addressed;
yet still, she felt nervous.&nbsp; She saw the grocer, Mr. Diotelli, talking
with Brian Cook and Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; The dapper little Italian looked
quite elegant in his white tuxedo, and Nina had spent a pleasant fifteen
minutes with him earlier brushing up on her still rusty Italian.
<p>She was watching him now and didn't see whom she bumped into until after
it was too late.
<p>"Excuse me," said the young man.
<p>"No, it's my fault," Nina replied, turning to look at him.&nbsp; "Christopher!"
she exclaimed.&nbsp; It was Kelly's twin brother.
<p>"Hello Nina, how are you," he said with a friendly smile.
<p>"I'm fine, how are you?" Nina replied, glad to see him.
<p>"Very good.&nbsp; You look lovely tonight...different, I like it.&nbsp;
I'm happy to see that Grandfather lets you dress some of the time."
<p>Nina blushed.&nbsp; The last time she had seen Christopher she had been
nude.&nbsp; She wasn't now, but she might well have been.&nbsp; She was
dressed in another IO creation, an odd outfit made up of ten gossamer thin
pillowcase sized panels placed in layers over her body.&nbsp; IO had literally
sewed her into the outfit.&nbsp; Nina didn't see much point in it, though.&nbsp;
Under bright light, the material might as well have been invisible, her
body easily seen, but out here on the patio, it was dark enough to give
her a little covering.
<p>Nina shivered at Christopher's frank gaze.&nbsp; "I'm glad you like
it!"
<p>They engaged in a little small talk, and then Christopher excused himself
to go find his sister.&nbsp; Nina knew she wouldn't be hard to find, Kelly
was the only genuine nude at the party.&nbsp; It was what told Nina for
sure that this group was one of Brian's special groups, and it was why
Nina was nervous.&nbsp; With THIS group, Nina knew she would be out of
her clothes, such as they were, at some point before the end of the evening.
<p>Nina took another sip of her drink.
<p>Nina wondered why she had been given something to wear in the first
place; she was soon to find out.
<p>"Nina," said Brian, edging through the crowd.&nbsp; "I need you now.&nbsp;
We're about to unveil the statue and I want you up there with me for the
auction."
<p>"Auction?" Nina said.
<p>"Yes, the charity auction.&nbsp; Didn't I tell you about that?" said
the old man.
<p>"No, Sir," replied the girl.
<p>"I'm getting forgetful in my old age.&nbsp; Well, come along and you'll
soon find out."
<p>Nina nodded and carefully followed her host toward the platform.&nbsp;
As thin as her dress was, she didn't want to catch it on anyone or anything;
it was all she had.
<p>Brian reached the platform first and reached underneath it to flip a
switch.&nbsp; The white cloth wrap covering the statue instantly burst
into light, and Nina realized that a large black light had been turned
on.
<p>Climbing the steps to the platform, Nina got another surprise.&nbsp;
Her plain and almost invisible looking garments suddenly blazed with color,
the threads reacting strongly with the strange light.&nbsp; Suddenly Nina
didn't feel so naked; it was impossible to see anything under the gauze
she wore.&nbsp; She smiled as she joined her host, and to her surprise,
Helen also joined them on the platform, although she stood to one side
out of the light.
<p>"Ladies, Gentleman," Brian said to the crowd.&nbsp; Quite unnecessarily,
as the bright glow of the statue and Nina's glowing outfit had already
caught most people's attention.
<p>What little conversation was left quickly died out, and all focused
on the platform.&nbsp; Nina began to blush under all the eyes.&nbsp; She
could barely feel the gauze covering her body, yet she knew she was well
covered.&nbsp; It dawned on her that for as long as she stood under the
black light, she was effectively dressed in nothing but light.&nbsp; It
was rather surreal.
<p>"Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen for coming tonight, to see the unveiling
of my latest work," Brian Cook began.&nbsp; "Beside me as you can see is
Nina, whom most of you have met.&nbsp; She has been my inspiration for
this piece, and I could not have done it without her.&nbsp; Nina, I thank
you."
<p>Brian started applauding, and soon the rest of the crowd joined in.&nbsp;
Nina smiled and blushed even further.
<p>"And now, to begin.&nbsp; The piece is unnamed, as is my custom.&nbsp;
Its new owner has that honor."&nbsp; Without further ado, Brian walked
around the statue and gently pulled the cover from it.&nbsp; Nina bit her
lip in anticipation, and then stood startled at what she saw.&nbsp; She
KNEW the statue was a nude of her, but someone, most likely IO, had dressed
it in exactly the same outfit Nina now wore.&nbsp; The both of them glowed
in multicolored splendor.
<p>There was applause from the crowd who moved closer for a better look.&nbsp;
The figure of Nina stood about four feet high.&nbsp; It showed her standing,
her head slightly down, but with her eyes looking up at the viewer.&nbsp;
Her arms were by her side, fists clenched.&nbsp; Its entire body language
suggested restraint, someone resisting the urge to flee, to cover up, to
hide.&nbsp; There was a haunting look about the face that hinted at a nakedness
far beyond the body.&nbsp; It was a magnificent piece of work, despite
the fact that it wore clothes.
<p>Brian gave the assembled guests a few minutes to get a good look, before
moving on to the next part of the evening.
<p>"Those of you who have been here before know it is my custom to offer
my new pieces for auction at their unveiling; a practice my agent despises,
by the way."
<p>General laughter by the crowd.
<p>"As most of you already know, I also do not sell my work for profit.&nbsp;
All proceeds from the sales go to charity; and tonight the proceeds will
be split between the Riley Children's Hospital, and the Wells Community
Food Bank."
<p>More applause and agreement from the crowd.&nbsp; Nina, who knew nothing
of this, was quite impressed, and thought that maybe having a nude statue
of herself being sold wasn't quite so bad anymore if the money went to
charity.
<p>Brian waited until the murmuring died down.
<p>"Tonight, however, you are all witness to something new.&nbsp; I'm sure
you have noticed the beautiful outfit the lovely Nina has been wearing
all night, courtesy of IO; give him a hand, please."
<p>IO smiled and turned to acknowledge the crowd.
<p>"You have also noticed that the statue is wearing an identical outfit,
not at all what you were expecting.&nbsp; Well, I can tell you that the
outfit is not a part of the piece, but a continuation of its unveiling,
and to continue requires your co-operation."
<p>There was a general murmur from the crowd as they wondered what Brian
meant by that, while Brian walked over to the statue.
<p>Nina noticed Helen walk up to her.&nbsp; "Do you know what's going on?"
Nina whispered to her.
<p>Helen nodded but avoided looking Nina in the eye.&nbsp; "Brian explained
it to me just a little bit ago.&nbsp; I'm sorry, Nina."
<p>"Sorry for what?" Nina asked.
<p>Brian began speaking again, and Helen didn't answer.
<p>"Both Nina's outfit and the statue's consist of ten pieces.&nbsp; In
order to remove each piece, I must know who to give them to.&nbsp; In order
to know that, you will have to dig a little deeper into your wallets, for
I am going to auction off each piece to you.&nbsp; But not just the statue's,
oh no.&nbsp; The winner of each auction claims the identical panel from
both the statue AND Nina!"
<p>There was a gasp and polite laughter from the crowd, who moved forward
again, crowding the platform a little.
<p>Nina stood stunned, not quite believing what she had just heard.&nbsp;
Not only was she going to be stripped on stage in front of everyone, but
also Brian was actually going to sell each item she had on to the highest
bidder.&nbsp; It was almost too much for her, but she couldn't bring herself
to protest.&nbsp; One thing that stopped her was the benefit to the charities.&nbsp;
Nina had always been a sucker for charities.
<p>"So let the bidding begin!" Brian said.
<p>Nina stood still and listened as various people called out monetary
amounts.&nbsp; The first winner claimed his prize at the cost of $1,000.&nbsp;
Brian removed a panel covering the statue's waist and Helen did likewise
for Nina.&nbsp; Nina just bit her lip, unable to move.
<p>Prize claimed, Brian started the bidding again.
<p>The next four pieces all went for $1,000 each, and by the time the panels
were removed, Nina's legs, back and midriff were bare.
<p>Panel number six went for $1,400, and this panel covered her upper chest.&nbsp;
Helen pulled it away from Nina, exposing her cleavage.&nbsp; From this
point on, anything removed would expose her significantly.
<p>As each panel was taken from her, the crowd showed their polite appreciation
with applause and congratulations for the buyer.&nbsp; They also eyed both
Nina and the statue, giving her encouraging and at times sympathetic looks.&nbsp;
Only a few looked at her with anything that could be taken sexually.&nbsp;
One of those was Sarah Wickland, Nina's boss, who had come to the front
of the stage.&nbsp; She winked at Nina and waved her finger.
<p>Panel number seven sold for $2,600, and Brian removed the single panel
covering the statue's rear end.
<p>Helen did the honors with Nina, carefully pulling at the tiny stitching
so that she could pull the wispy cloth away without destroying the rest
of the outfit.&nbsp; Nina thought she might have imagined it, but she could
have sworn she felt the difference between her butt covered and uncovered.
<p>Panel eight went for $5,000, and this time it was the one covering her
left breast.&nbsp; Her breasts had been encased bikini fashion; one panel
for each side, and the release of one left the other just barely covered.
<p>Nina felt like she wanted to run and hide, but she gritted her teeth
and hung on.&nbsp; She didn't know it, but she had unconsciously adopted
the same pose as the statue itself.&nbsp; Most of the artists present noticed,
though, and they were impressed with the detail Brian had been able to
achieve with stone.
<p>Number nine went for $8,000, and as expected, her right breast was now...unveiled.&nbsp;
All that was left was a panel across her hips.&nbsp; It glowed brightly
in the black light, hiding her treasures from the crowd, but it wasn't
to last.
<p>"Final bidding," Brian said.
<p>Nina closed her eyes and listened.&nbsp; $1,000 came and went in a flash,
$5,000 was passed without slowing down, at $10,000 the bidding grew almost
silent, but the winning bid was $11,500 from, of all people, Mr. Diotelli.
<p>Helen carefully pulled at the last piece of stitching and gracefully
exposed her friend to the crowd.&nbsp; There was an enthusiastic response,
and Nina stood blushing furiously as she was applauded.
<p>"Thank you, thank you," said Brian.&nbsp; "There will be a short break
before bidding on the statue itself commences.&nbsp; Please feel free to
come up and inspect it."
<p>People came up and Nina stood silent, not knowing what to do.&nbsp;
She looked around for Helen, but she was off delivering Nina's clothing
to the different winners.
<p>Sarah stepped up to her and smiled.&nbsp; "You did good tonight.&nbsp;
We're all proud of you."
<p>"Proud of me?" Nina said.
<p>"Yes.&nbsp; Proud.&nbsp; We all know that many wouldn't have stood here
and taken what you did.&nbsp; In fact, I'm surprised that Brian put you
through it.&nbsp; What did you do to piss him off?"
<p>Nina thought about the pressure she had put on Brian to let Helen stay
with them while her apartment was being fixed.&nbsp; Surely, he didn't
hold a grudge.&nbsp; Nina shrugged.
<p>"Anyway," Sarah said, "I'm going to go look at the statue.&nbsp; I think
it might look nice in one corner of Franklin's office.&nbsp; I know HE
would like it."
<p>Nina's eyes opened wide; the thought of that statue being there where
anyone in the firm could see it horrified her.
<p>"Oh no, please!" Nina begged.
<p>Sarah laughed.&nbsp; "Don't worry, I'm not that cruel.&nbsp; Besides,
Franklin doesn't deserve a treat that expensive."
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "Good."
<p>"I'd probably just take it home and keep it there," Sarah continued,
and she grinned and walked away.
<p>Nina shuddered, and was approached by someone else.&nbsp; During the
entire break, she stood nude while talking to various people who congratulated
her and complimented her.&nbsp; Several artists inquired as to whether
she was available for modeling, and Nina said she was.&nbsp; This made
a lot of people rather happy.
<p>Eventually Brian came back, and the group left the stage so the auction
could continue.
<p>Brian didn't waste any time, and the first bid came in at a firm $10,000.&nbsp;
$20,000 quickly followed, but it bogged down after that, going up slowly
but surely.&nbsp; Sarah Wickland offered a $26,000 bid, winking at Nina
as she did so, but it was quickly raised past that point and she didn't
bid again.
<p>Nina stood in silent wonder, amazed that so many people were willing
to pay so much for a statue of HER!&nbsp; She didn't know whether to feel
flattered or afraid.
<p>$40,000...$50,000...bidding seemed to stall out at $58,000 with a portly
looking gentleman near the back looking rather pleased with himself.&nbsp;
It took Nina a moment to recognize him, even though she saw the man almost
once a week.&nbsp; It was the nude shopper from Diotelli's grocery store,
and it was the first time Nina had seen him dressed.
<p>Brian called out for more bids, but none were forthcoming.
<p>"Any more?" he said, looking around at the silent crowd.&nbsp; "Then
the bidding is..."
<p>"WAIT!" yelled a voice from the house.&nbsp; The crowd turned to look
behind them.&nbsp; It was dark back there though and the man was invisible.
<p>"Yes?&nbsp; You wish to bid?" Brian called out.
<p>"Sorry I'm late; what's the bid?" yelled the man.
<p>"$58,000, Sir," Brian replied.
<p>"Well then, I bid $80,000!"
<p>The crowed gasped, and the man began to make his way to the front.
<p>Brian smiled and asked for more bids, but no one was willing.&nbsp;
He waited until the young man made his way to the stage and then called
it.
<p>"SOLD, for $80,000.&nbsp; Congratulations, Mr. Barb!"
<p>Nina was stunned once more in an evening she thought couldn't hold any
more surprises.&nbsp; For she knew Mr. Barb very well; Mr. JIM Barb, that
is.
<p>Jim climbed up on the stage and shook Brian's hand.
<p>"You get to name it!" Brian said.
<p>Jim grinned and turned to the nude young lady it was modeled on.&nbsp;
"There is only one name, 'Nina'," he said.
<p>"'Nina' it is then," Brian said with a smile.
<p>The crowd applauded, and Jim walked over to Nina.&nbsp; "Hi!" he said
with a smile.
<p>"How...I mean...where...what are you doing here?" Nina said, or at least
tried to say.
<p>"I was invited.&nbsp; Almost didn't make it.&nbsp; Glad I did, though;
I really wanted that statue."
<p>"But...you don't have that kind of money!" Nina said.
<p>"What makes you think that?" he said with a smile, and he took her hand.&nbsp;
"Come on, I'll tell you about it over a drink.&nbsp; I came all the way
up here to see you."
<p>Nina smiled and allowed herself to be led off the stage, no longer caring
about her nudity.
<p>The crowd broke up now that the auction was over, and the happy buyers
all talked about their purchases.&nbsp; Brian was ecstatic, and looked
forward to presenting checks to both the night's charities.
<p>Only Helen seemed subdued.&nbsp; She stood in the shadows and watched
Nina and Jim together, and wondered why she didn't feel settled.
<p>The unveiling over, the evening went on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 18.

<p>Part 19,&nbsp; CoRTN
<p>"There they are again," said Nina.
<p>Helen, who was driving, turned to look where Nina was pointing, and
after a moment returned her attention to the road.&nbsp; They were on their
way to work, and while riding, Nina had spotted a crowd.&nbsp; In the middle
was a pickup truck loaded with flowers, and Nina glimpsed, among the men
surrounding it, a couple of nude figures.
<p>"Why do they do that?" Nina said as they drove on.
<p>"What, sell flowers?" said Helen.&nbsp; It was the day after the unveiling,
and Helen was still feeling her drunk, or the results of it.&nbsp; She
had thought she had been done with alcohol after her disgraceful display
at the restaurant a few weeks before, but after the unveiling Helen had
felt the need to hit the sauce.&nbsp; She had woken up hours later in her
own bed, totally unwrapped from the silk sarong she had been given to wear,
feeling nauseous and rather fuzzy headed.&nbsp; She still wasn't sure how
she had gotten there, and the uncertainty worried her.&nbsp; That, and
the headache, contributed to her having a bit of a short temper this morning.&nbsp;
Well...that wasn't the only reason.&nbsp; She tried not to look at Nina,
for some reason not wanting to.
<p>"No, Silly," Nina said.&nbsp; "Why are they out there naked?"
<p>"I told you, it's a religious thing," Helen replied smartly.
<p>Nina thought it was pretty stupid.&nbsp; What kind of religion made
you walk around naked?&nbsp; She tried once more to make out the sign in
front of the truck, but again was unsuccessful.&nbsp; They continued on.
<p>Parking in the employee lot, Nina and Helen made the journey to the
office they shared in silence.&nbsp; Nina knew Helen was hung over; her
friend had been in a terrible state the night before when she and Jim had
found her.&nbsp; Nina wondered if Brian's edict that Helen strip for him
at certain times had caused her to start drinking.&nbsp; This puzzled Nina,
because Brian Cook had hardly called Helen on her "Rent" at all during
her stay.&nbsp; In fact, by Nina's figuring, Helen still owed about sixteen
hours of nudity to Brian.
<p>Still, whatever the cause, it took both Jim and Nina to get the near
unconscious girl up to her guest room, and Jim was kind enough to slip
away while Nina made Helen more comfortable for sleeping.
<p>Nina hadn't mentioned it on the drive over, and neither had Helen.&nbsp;
Nina figured Helen just wanted to forget the whole thing, which was fine
by her.
<p>Upon arrival at their office, Nina saw a note on her desk.&nbsp; It
was from Sarah Wickland, the Partner who had all but taken over Nina's
time at the firm, even though all the paralegals were supposed to work
for all the lawyers.&nbsp; Nina knew that word had spread throughout the
firm that Sarah had claimed her, so Nina was now rarely given work by anyone
else.
<p>Under normal circumstances, Nina would have been thrilled to be singled
out by a lawyer like Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; To be mentored and watched over
by someone high in the profession was incredibly beneficial.&nbsp; But
Sarah was different.&nbsp; Not only did Sarah know about Nina's unusual
home situation, she also enjoyed placing Nina in a similar situation here
at work.&nbsp; It was rare when Nina got to spend any time in Sarah's private
suite of offices with any clothes on.&nbsp; It was expected of Nina to
undress and stay nude while up there.&nbsp; The only other people in the
company that knew of this were Helen, who knew almost everything, and Sarah's
creepy assistant, Franklin.
<p>Looking at the note, Nina sighed.&nbsp; She usually got an hour or two
in the morning to do some work at her own desk, but it looked like that
wasn't to be today.&nbsp; It seemed to her that she only got to get dressed
for the trip to and from work, and sometimes she wondered why she bothered.
<p>"I have to go see Sarah," Nina said to Helen.
<p>Helen waved a piece of paper in the air and smiled.&nbsp; "Me too.&nbsp;
Come on, let's go."&nbsp; Unlike Nina, Helen thought it amusing that Nina
had to spend time upstairs working nude.
<p>Franklin was at his desk in the outer office as usual, and smiled as
the ladies entered.
<p>"Hi, Nina," he said slowly, grinning like a sex starved maniac and making
Nina shudder.
<p>"Hello, Franklin," Nina replied, and she glanced over at the corner
of the room.
<p>There had been a change in the format recently that Nina wasn't too
thrilled about.&nbsp; Before, when she had to undress, she did so in Sarah's
office, her clothes locked away in a closet.&nbsp; But now, she had to
undress here in the outer office in front of Franklin, who would then lock
them in his own closet in the corner of the office.
<p>Nina didn't like undressing for Franklin; the way he looked at her made
her sick, and despite Sarah's comments that he was harmless, she didn't
trust him much.&nbsp; She also feared discovery by someone just walking
in to the outer office to see Sarah.&nbsp; Unlike the rest of her suite,
the outer office was a public area.&nbsp; So far, she had been lucky.
<p>Franklin noted where Nina had looked.
<p>"Yes, Nina.&nbsp; You have to get undressed," he said with a grin.
<p>Nina bit her lip and moved mechanically to the closet.&nbsp; Opening
the door gave her a little cover in case someone came in, and she always
thought that if it came to it, she could just jump in and hide.&nbsp; But
it didn't give her cover from Franklin, who sat back in his chair to watch.
<p>Helen moved to the other side of the room to watch also.&nbsp; She was
fascinated with the way Nina removed her clothes, seeing it every day at
the house when she and Nina came home.&nbsp; Nina usually started by kicking
her shoes off, which she did this time.&nbsp; Nina didn't wear pantyhose
or stockings--she disliked them both--so her legs and feet were bare.&nbsp;
She took her jacket off and hung it up neatly, before reaching for the
fastener of her skirt.&nbsp; With a sidelong glance at Franklin, Nina unfastened
the skirt and let it drop, stepping out of it without bending over.&nbsp;
She hung this up too.&nbsp; Then she took a deep breath and undid the buttons
of her blouse, removing it and hanging it up without looking around.
<p>A blush began to creep slowly across her face and down her chest as
she next undid her bra, and she held it to herself for a moment before
removing it and placing it in the closet.
<p>Her back was to Franklin; all that was left was her panties, and there
was no easy way to take them off without further embarrassment.&nbsp; So
she just quickly pulled them down and stepped out of them, putting them
on top of her bra.&nbsp; She turned, crossing her arms in front of her
breasts, and glared at Franklin.
<p>He made a show of checking the phone on his desk.&nbsp; "You can go
through in just a minute, she's on the phone," he said.
<p>Nina's glare grew stronger.&nbsp; Franklin was always playing these
games, getting the most out of his limited power over her.&nbsp; Nina had
once complained to Sarah, but Sarah waved it off.&nbsp; "As long as he
doesn't touch you or compromise your privacy, you'll have to put up with
him," Nina was told.&nbsp; So she was stuck with stripping for him pretty
much every day.
<p>Helen was sorry for her friend, but was glad that SHE didn't have to
do this.&nbsp; Sarah seemed focused on Nina for some reason, and Helen
was glad to be out of the spotlight for the most part.&nbsp; Helen did
wonder what it was that made Nina do this for Sarah; she had no idea that
Nina had agreed to endure these further humiliations in order to spare
Helen.
<p>Franklin got his hefty bulk out of his chair and walked over to the
closet where Nina was standing.&nbsp; "I'd better lock this so you don't
lose anything," he said.
<p>Nina shuddered and moved away from her only protection.&nbsp; Standing
naked in the middle of the office, she shared a sad look with Helen and
wished for some cover.
<p>Franklin returned to his desk, not quite passing within touching distance
of Nina, which she almost never let happen, and looked at his phone again.&nbsp;
"She's done, you can go in now."
<p>Without a word, Nina made for the door to the inner office and Helen
followed.
<p>"You're an asshole, Franklin," Helen told him as she passed.
<p>Franklin just smiled and replied, "I still remember what YOU look like
naked."
<p>Helen flushed, from both embarrassment and anger, and entered the inner
office.
<p>Inside it looked like Sarah had been there a while already, despite
the party the night before and the early hour.&nbsp; She looked up, smiled
at the two paralegals, and invited them to sit in front of her desk.
<p>Nina actually relaxed coming into the office, showing how normal this
abnormal experience was for her.&nbsp; Compared to being out front with
Franklin, being nude in here was a lot easier for Nina, and she almost
didn't think about it anymore.
<p>She and Helen took their seats, Nina feeling the grip of the upholstered
leather against her bare skin.
<p>"How are you both?" Sarah asked with a pleasant smile, "Did you enjoy
the party last night?"
<p>Both women nodded and mumbled the appropriate words.
<p>"Well I did too.&nbsp; Please pass on my thanks to Brian, Nina."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am, I will," Nina replied.
<p>"I have to tell you I was disappointed I didn't get that fine piece
Brian did of you.&nbsp; The statue would have looked good in here."&nbsp;
Sarah smiled and the younger women dutifully chuckled.&nbsp; "By the way,
I was surprised to see that it was young Jim Barb who bought it.&nbsp;
I didn't know you knew him."
<p>Nina had been surprised too.&nbsp; When she asked him where he got the
money, he mumbled something about having a rich family and changed the
subject.&nbsp; She wondered where he was going to put it, something else
he kept mum about.
<p>"He's...er..." Nina said, knowing that Sarah expected a reply.&nbsp;
"We're...kinda dating."
<p>Sarah raised her eyebrows.&nbsp; "You and Jim Barb?&nbsp; That's excellent,
Sweety!&nbsp; You two make a good couple."
<p>"Do you know him, Ma'am?" Nina asked.
<p>"I've met him, but I know his parents better.&nbsp; They are clients
of the firm, I believe.&nbsp; OLD money."
<p>Helen listened to this with interest.&nbsp; She wanted to know more
about Nina's relationship with Jim, but never got the chance to ask last
night and didn't feel up to it this morning.&nbsp; Maybe later.
<p>Sarah sat up straight and looked both women in the eyes.&nbsp; "To work!&nbsp;
I have a special job for you, Nina, a rather delicate one."
<p>Nina groaned.&nbsp; All these special jobs usually involved her either
losing her clothes for some reason or her meeting the weirdest people,
often both.&nbsp; Her last special job involved a horse, three balloons,
and a biker.&nbsp; She wasn't going to forget that one in a hurry.
<p>"I need you to serve some papers for me.&nbsp; I've made the proper
arrangements so it's legal; all you have to do is place them in his hand."
<p>"Don't you have process servers who do that?" Nina asked, puzzled.
<p>"Yes, but they can't reach this guy.&nbsp; Maybe you can.&nbsp; In fact,
I know you can," Sarah replied.
<p>"Why?" asked Nina.
<p>Sarah picked up a pamphlet from her desk and handed it to Nina.&nbsp;
"Read," she said.
<p>Nina unfolded it and began to read.
<p>"This has to be a joke," she said after a few minutes.
<p>"Sorry, no.&nbsp; They won their religious charter a while back, and
it's a legal religion in this State," Sarah said.
<p>Helen reached for the pamphlet.&nbsp; "Can I see?"
<p>Nina handed it to her.&nbsp; "Is this the church you were talking about?"
<p>Helen saw the name and nodded.&nbsp; Then she read the rest of it.
<p>-----
<p>"CoRTN:&nbsp; Church of Redemption Through Nudity.
<br>Founder and Chief Pastor, Roy Jones.
<p>A brief guide.
<p>Introduction
<br>============
<p>It is felt that only through the denial of self that true enlightenment
is achieved.&nbsp; CoRTN is a manifestation of that belief.
<p>CoRTN has created this short document to act as a guide through the
specific beliefs of CoRTN and more importantly to map out the path that
the true devotee must travel.
<p>There are 7 stages of enlightenment grouped into 4 levels.
<p>Stage&nbsp;&nbsp; Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
<br>-----&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Encouraging Intimacy
<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enlightenment&nbsp;&nbsp; Denial of
Self
<p>All stages will include the restrictions, prohibitions, and prescribed
activities of all of the preceding stages.
<p>Probation
<br>=========
<p>At this level, the devotee is just starting the journey.&nbsp; CoRTN
is aware of the deeply ingrained attitudes of the devotee and the community
within which she will be living and therefore the initial stages are wholly
concerned with appearance.
<p>Also at this level the devotee will be attempting to maintain an education
or a home. These activities are not to be hindered by the adoption of the
stages within this level
<p>1) Denial of Clothing
<p>The devotee shall forswear all clothing in perpetuity and will not attempt
to use towels or bed clothes, where they are available, as temporary covering.&nbsp;
As far as possible, devotees at this level will attempt not to use either
bedclothes or towels as the devotee becomes accustomed to her nude state.
<p>2) Denial of Modesty
<p>The devotee shall forswear all modest behavior in perpetuity.&nbsp;
The devotee is proud of her body and is determined to share her joy in
it with the rest of the world.
<p>CoRTN has devised some guidelines to which the devotee must adhere to
demonstrate the attainment of this level.
<p>a) Removal of all body hair below the neck.
<br>b) Knees to be held apart by at least 12 inches whether standing or
seated.
<br>c) Unless otherwise occupied, hands to be held clasped together behind
the devotee's back.
<p>Novitiate
<br>=========
<p>At this level, the devotee is becoming aware of the deep changes in
mental attitude that CoRTN requires.&nbsp; This and subsequent levels involve
changes and behavior that may be shocking to those not aware of the philosophical
basis of this religion.
<p>As with the probationary level, the adoptions of the stages within this
level will not hinder the day-to-day activities of the devotee.
<p>3) Denial of Privacy
<p>The devotee shall forswear the right to privacy.&nbsp; The devotee feels
that there is no action that a human being can undertake that should be
hidden.&nbsp; Actions that are felt necessary to be hidden are actions
that should not be undertaken at all.&nbsp; The devotee feels that all
bodily functions and activities should be joyfully exposed to public view.
<p>In practical terms, this means that the devotee will not allow herself
to be in a room alone, unless the room is otherwise a public room.&nbsp;
If it is unavoidable that the devotee is to be in a private room, attempts
should be made to ensure that public access is possible at all times, e.g.
by removing all doors and window coverings.&nbsp; Activities that would
normally take place between two people would require a witness or should
take place in an otherwise public place.
<p>4) Encouraging Display
<p>The devotee shall encourage the enjoyment of the sight of her body by
whomsoever desires it.&nbsp; She will joyfully and with enthusiasm accede
to any request of those that wish to see her, with no reservation whatsoever.
<p>The devotee shall accede to all requests, unless otherwise engaged in
activities essential to her daily life.
<p>Supplication
<br>============
<p>The devotee is well on the road to enlightenment.&nbsp; However, the
sense of self that is the bane of all human life has still to be addressed.&nbsp;
At this level, the devotee is to start down the road that eventually leads
to full enlightenment.
<p>As with the preceding two levels, the adoption of the stages within
this level will not hinder the day-to-day activities of the devotee.
<p>5) Encouraging Interaction
<p>The devotee shall encourage the enjoyment of the feel of her body by
whomsoever desires it.&nbsp; She will joyfully and with enthusiasm accede
to any request of those that wish to feel her, with the sole reservation
that such touching will involve the hands only.
<p>The devotee shall accede to all requests unless otherwise engaged in
activities essential to her daily life.
<p>6) Encouraging Intimacy
<p>The devotee shall encourage the enjoyment of her body by whomsoever
desires it.&nbsp; She will joyfully and with enthusiasm accede to any request
by those that wish to enjoy her, with no reservations beyond those of time
and practicality.
<p>The devotee shall accede to all requests unless otherwise engaged in
activities essential to her daily life.
<p>Enlightenment
<br>=============
<p>The devotee has reached enlightenment; she has no thought of her selfhood,
she has only one wish: To perform any service or activity that is requested
of her.&nbsp; Her day-to-day life is at an end, and her continued existence
is dependent solely on the goodwill of others, in the manner of the "flowers
of the field".
<p>7) Denial of Self
<p>The devotee shall demonstrate her denial of self by joyfully and with
enthusiasm acceding to any request for the enjoyment of her body by whomsoever
requests it with no reservations whatsoever.
<p>She will at all times be available for such requests; she must take
no independent action whatsoever. All activities of any nature whatever
must be undertaken solely at the direct request of another.
<p>The CoRTN has established guidelines to which the devotee must adhere
to demonstrate that she has attained enlightenment:
<p>a) Certain decorative piercings shall be placed upon the body of the
devotee.
<br>b) The devotee shall have a mark placed upon her so all know of her
enlightenment.
<br>c) The devotee will allow herself to be restrained by device or the
will of another at any time.
<p>----
<p>As Helen read, Nina and Sarah continued to talk.
<p>"They are a legal religion," Sarah continued, "but the State has limited
their freedom of expression somewhat.&nbsp; Right now, they are fighting
a battle with the State over being allowed to practice their religion in
the public eye.&nbsp; It's all about nudity, you see, and the State doesn't
want nude women walking the streets just anywhere.&nbsp; So it said they
could practice as much as they like, as long as they keep it behind closed
doors."
<p>"But we saw them selling flowers on the street," Nina said.
<p>"I know.&nbsp; The City grants them temporary license to be able to
do that and attend some public functions.&nbsp; Personally, I think they
have a friend on the City Council, or they wouldn't be able to get away
with it.
<p>"Do they really think they can win?"
<p>Sarah hesitated before answering.&nbsp; "I think...they have a good
shot.&nbsp; There are a couple of states already where nudity for religious
reasons has been allowed, although it is continually being challenged.&nbsp;
In fact, I might...well I hope to win a client who could soon be involved
in just such a case."&nbsp; Sarah reflected on the nude coed she had met
on a recent trip, a young woman caught in a situation she couldn't easily
get out of.&nbsp; She didn't mention this to Nina.
<p>Helen had finished reading, and put down the disgusting document.&nbsp;
"Is this case what we're going to be involved with?"
<p>"No."&nbsp; Sarah actually looked disappointed, and both the younger
women thought that Sarah would have enjoyed working a case that would have
allowed women to walk the streets nude.
<p>"We have a different client," Sarah said.&nbsp; "Clients, actually."&nbsp;
She handed Nina and Helen a couple of files, and told them of how several
families were suing CoRTN for fraud, claiming that it was not a religion
but a cult, and that their daughters were illegally entrapped by the church's
leader, Roy Jones.&nbsp; "In relinquishing all clothing, it seems that
a lot of other worldly goods are relinquished also, right into the hands
of Roy Jones."
<p>"So it's a criminal case, then?" Helen asked.
<p>"No, civil.&nbsp; There isn't enough evidence to pursue a criminal charge
yet, but I can take him to court on a civil suit, IF I can serve him."
<p>Nina looked up from her file, a scared look on her face.&nbsp; "You
want me to go there, don't you.&nbsp; You want me to go and join this group
of crazies, get naked with them, follow these steps."
<p>Sarah took a deep breath and sighed.&nbsp; "Nina, it will just be for
a day, maybe just a couple of hours.&nbsp; You just need to get inside
the compound and find Roy Jones.&nbsp; Once you serve him, you can leave."
<p>"No, I can't do this," Nina said.
<p>"You have to.&nbsp; Our clients are depending on getting him in court.&nbsp;
They are worried about their daughters."
<p>"I can't.&nbsp; I just can't," said Nina shaking her head.
<p>Sarah frowned and after a minute turned to Helen.&nbsp; "Well, I guess
YOU'LL have to do it."
<p>"What?" said Helen, sitting up.&nbsp; "Oh no!"
<p>"She can't!" Nina said.
<p>"Well, someone will have to," said the Legallady.&nbsp; "And if you
won't do it, Nina, then it falls to Helen."
<p>Helen turned deathly white.&nbsp; "But...no..."
<p>Nina winced.&nbsp; She felt up against that hard place again.&nbsp;
She couldn't let Helen go; her friend wouldn't be able to do it.
<p>"I..." she started to say.
<p>"Yes, Nina?" Sarah said.
<p>"I'll...do it."&nbsp; Nina hung her head.
<p>"I knew I could count on you," Sarah said with a smile.
<p>Helen took her nude friend's hand.&nbsp; "Thanks."
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; Then she looked up at Sarah.&nbsp; "Wait a minute.&nbsp;
If I have to go in there nude, and can't take anything with me, how am
I to take Roy Jones the papers I have to serve him?&nbsp; I can't serve
him verbally."
<p>"No, you can't.&nbsp; But I have a special set made up for you that
you CAN take in with you.&nbsp; They're unusual, but legal."&nbsp; Sarah
handed over to Nina a pink plastic tube.&nbsp; It was smooth, with one
end rounded, while the other had a screw off top.
<p>Helen immediately grasped the significance of the size and shape of
the object but it didn't hit Nina yet.
<p>"What is this?" Nina said.
<p>"Open the end, look inside," was Sarah's reply.
<p>Nina did as she was told, and saw that packed tightly inside were several
sheets of paper.&nbsp; "I don't understand," she said, screwing the end
back on, but then she got it.&nbsp; "Oh no!" she said slowly.
<p>"It's the only way, Nina," Sarah said.
<p>"But I can't...what if they search me?"
<p>"They won't search you.&nbsp; You're going to be nude, so they can SEE
you don't need to be searched, and they won't get THAT intimate with you."
<p>"But.&nbsp; This is so...big."
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "No bigger than average.&nbsp; Don't tell me that
Jim Barb hasn't...well, achieved full manhood yet."
<p>Nina blushed fully, even her nipples rose and tinted a darker red.
<p>"Stand up, see if it fits," Sarah ordered.
<p>"What, here?"&nbsp; Nina said, looking around.
<p>"Of course!&nbsp; It's just us ladies here; or would you prefer to go
let Franklin help you?"
<p>Nina glared at Sarah and bit back a sudden remark.&nbsp; She silently
got up and stood to one side of the desk.
<p>With both Helen and Sarah watching closely, Nina carefully inserted
the tube into her still somewhat bare pussy.&nbsp; It was a good thing
the tube had a natural slickness to it, or Nina wouldn't have been able
to do it.&nbsp; But she managed after a little effort to push most of the
tube in.&nbsp; It felt awful going in, very intrusive, and doing it under
the watchful eye of both her boss and her friend didn't help.
<p>"All the way, dear; it has to be hidden," Sarah said.
<p>Nina trembled and resumed pushing until she felt her pussy lips close
around the twist off end.&nbsp; She felt an unnatural fullness that wasn't
very pleasant.
<p>"Now, how quickly can you extract it and pull the papers out?" Sarah
asked.
<p>Nina stared at her a moment before reaching between her legs again.&nbsp;
She pulled the tube out as fast as she dared, and was about to open the
top when Sarah stopped her.&nbsp; "Don't take the papers out right now,
you'll never get them back in."
<p>"I don't like this," Nina said.
<p>"I know, dear.&nbsp; But we sometimes have to do things we don't like
in order to succeed.&nbsp; Lawyers especially.&nbsp; It's what's called
duty.&nbsp; Now put it back."
<p>Nina did as she was told, and soon the tube was out of sight again.
<p>"Can you walk around with it?" Sarah asked the nude girl and Nina dutifully
strolled about the room.&nbsp; Sarah had Nina stretch, stand, sit, crouch...basically
go through a full range of motion test to see if the tube could be spotted.&nbsp;
Through all this, Helen just sat back and watched, enjoying the sight of
her nude friend and immensely glad it wasn't HER.
<p>"Okay, that'll work.&nbsp; You might as well keep it in you so you can
get used to it.&nbsp; Now we have to figure out how to get you accepted
by them and taken into the compound," Sarah said.
<p>Helen held up her hand.&nbsp; "I...er...have an idea about that."
<p>"Yes, Helen, what is it?"&nbsp; Sarah said, not expecting much.&nbsp;
What she heard changed her mind, while Nina just closed her eyes and wondered
what she did to deserve this.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"I can't believe you thought of this," said Nina, hugging herself tightly
in the passenger seat of Helen's car.&nbsp; The two young women had stayed
in Sarah Wickland's office for about an hour, going over what little Sarah
knew about Roy Jones and his church, before Nina finally declared herself
ready to go.&nbsp; All Sarah gave her to wear was a coat and her shoes,
telling her that she didn't need any more, considering where she was going.&nbsp;
The comment only served to make Nina more nervous, and she asked herself
again why she had agreed to do this.&nbsp; Nina felt used and humiliated,
and she hadn't even started the job yet.
<p>Right now, she sat, still in her coat, next to Helen as they watched
the crowd of men surrounding the flower girls they had passed on the way
to work earlier.&nbsp; From where they were parked, they were now behind
the makeshift stall, and more importantly, out of sight of the police car
that kept a constant watch on the actions of the nude flower sellers.
<p>Sarah had said that a police presence was one of the conditions of any
off-campus activities concerning the church.&nbsp; The official reason
was so that no harm came to the nude devotees, but Sarah said that unofficially
they were there to make sure that nothing but flowers were sold.
<p>In any case, Nina had to avoid being seen by the cops until she had
joined the flower sellers.&nbsp; The devotees were licensed to be nude
in public, but Nina wasn't.&nbsp; She would only be covered, so to speak,
if the devotees accepted her.
<p>Helen's plan was for Nina to just walk up to them in the nude and say
that she wanted to join the church.&nbsp; Such a brazen, immodest action
would no doubt show that Nina was serious.&nbsp; Why else would she walk
naked into a group of men?
<p>Nina thought the idea crazy, but Sarah latched on to it, as Nina knew
she would.
<p>So now, Nina sat watching the crowd, not wanting to go out there, but
resigned to doing so.&nbsp; What else could she do?
<p>"It seemed like a good idea to me," Helen replied.&nbsp; "You have the
papers?"
<p>Nina clenched, feeling the hard cylinder inside her, caressing her like
a lover, yet about as welcome down there as a case of the clap.&nbsp; Blushing,
she nodded.
<p>"Then I guess it's time; they're going to be leaving soon," Helen said,
looking at her friend.&nbsp; Nina looked scared to her, and Helen could
sympathize with that.&nbsp; But Nina also looked flushed, excited, and
Helen wondered what was going on in her head.&nbsp; Just what DID motivate
Nina?
<p>Nina took a deep breath and pulled back the coat.&nbsp; She had already
kicked off the shoes; she had only needed them to get out of the building.&nbsp;
She started to shiver as soon as her skin was bared, despite the fact that
the little car was like an oven about then.
<p>"I'll be following," Helen said, trying to encourage her friend.&nbsp;
"I'll wait right outside the gate of the compound for you to come out.&nbsp;
You'll be fine!"
<p>Nina nodded sharply, she didn't feel fine.&nbsp; "I don't want to do
this," she said.
<p>"I know.&nbsp; But I also know you CAN do this.&nbsp; The hardest part
is just this bit; it'll be easier once you're in the compound."
<p>Nina tried a smile, but it looked faked.&nbsp; She was surprised when
Helen leaned over and gave her a quick kiss on the lips.
<p>"For luck," Helen said with a smile.
<p>Nina stared at Helen for a moment, very surprised, then smiled a rather
more genuine smile.&nbsp; "Thanks.&nbsp; Well, here I go."&nbsp; She opened
the car door and, staying low, exited the car.
<p>Helen watched Nina creep between the cars separating them from the flower
stall, and when Nina felt she couldn't get closer without being seen, she
stood up and began to walk openly.&nbsp; She had covered most of the distance
before Helen saw people reacting to her.&nbsp; Some of the men turned and
began to whistle their appreciation, nudging their fellows in order to
point them at the new girl.&nbsp; From the grins on their faces, Helen
could see they were impressed, and Helen felt a pang of jealousy go though
her.&nbsp; Uncomfortable, she watched what happened.
<p>Nina reached the outer ring of 'customers' and asked to be let through.&nbsp;
The crowd parted obediently for her, but only just enough to give her space
to walk.&nbsp; Nina was blushing furiously, avoiding the eyes of all of
them and fighting strongly an urge to run back to Helen's car.&nbsp; She
was very conscious of the looks she was getting; the eyes on her tits,
her ass, her mostly bare pussy.&nbsp; She could feel their breaths as she
made her way through the group, flickering against her bare skin, unwanted
caresses.&nbsp; On top of it all was the tube inside her, shifting as she
walked, never letting her forget it was there.
<p>She broke through the ring of people and came face to face with the
devotees.&nbsp; Two women, much the same age as she, were selling flowers.&nbsp;
Both were nude of course, and neither showed the embarrassment at their
condition that Nina now showed.&nbsp; Well, almost.&nbsp; One, a little
prettier than the other, had that "OHMYGOD" look that Nina knew so well,
but it was only barely there, well hidden under a friendly smile.&nbsp;
Funnily enough, the two flower sellers didn't notice Nina right away; busy
with customers, their attention was only drawn to what was behind them
by the sudden silence of the crowd.&nbsp; They turned and both showed their
surprise.&nbsp; Nina got a surprise herself.&nbsp; Both the young women
sported a tiny silver nose ring through their septum; the more comfortable
looking one also had her nipples pierced.
<p>"Hi," Nina said, giving them an embarrassed smile.
<p>"Hi," said the prettier one, but the other one said, "Who are you and
what are you doing here?"&nbsp; There was no doubt in Nina's mind about
who was in charge here.
<p>"I'm Nina, and I...want to join you."
<p>"Hey, Baby, you can join with me if you like!" said one of the guys
beside her, and Nina began to blush once more as laughter flowed among
the men.&nbsp; The girl in charge glared at him, then looked back at Nina.
<p>"Usually new devotees present themselves at the Shrine, not here on
the street.&nbsp; Are you having us on?" she asked suspiciously.
<p>Nina opened her arms, displaying her nudity and hoping that the tube
was still hidden from sight.&nbsp; "Do I look like I'm having you on?"
<p>"So you're naked, big deal.&nbsp; Half the new girls that show up come
like that.&nbsp; They don't last a week.&nbsp; How do I know you won't
wash out like they do?"
<p>"I'm serious about this," Nina lied.
<p>The other girl moved forward.&nbsp; "Don't worry about Dana, she's just
giving you a hard time.&nbsp; I'm Gail, and I'm happy to meet you."&nbsp;
She smiled and extended a hand.
<p>The crowd parted again and a man in uniform pushed through, a man in
a police uniform.&nbsp; "What's going on here?" he said.&nbsp; "Who's this?"
<p>Gail looked to Dana, who sighed.&nbsp; "It's okay, Frank; she's with
us."
<p>Officer Frank gave Nina a searching look over before speaking again.&nbsp;
"She wasn't here before.&nbsp; I may have to take her in for indecent exposure!"&nbsp;
He licked his lips as he said that, his eyes never leaving Nina's body.&nbsp;
Nina felt afraid of him; he reminded her of Franklin.
<p>"Sorry, Frank, she's one of ours," Dana said, moving between Nina and
the cop.
<p>"If she's one of yours, where's her ring?"
<p>"She hasn't got one yet, Frank; she only just joined."
<p>"I don't know about this, you're only licensed for two members to be
out here, not three.&nbsp; If she's one of yours, then you're violating
your license.&nbsp; If she isn't, then she's obviously out here for a cheap
thrill and I'll have to take her in.&nbsp; So which is it?"
<p>Dana paused and turned to look at Nina, searching for that answer herself.&nbsp;
Everyone's attention was now upon the frightened girl, and Nina had never
felt so exposed.&nbsp; Then she caught Gail's eye.&nbsp; Gail was standing
in what Nina was to find out later as the 'neutral position'.&nbsp; Her
feet were apart a little more than shoulder width, and her hands clasped
behind her.&nbsp; This showed off her firm young body to full advantage,
and Nina could see that the position made Gail a little embarrassed.&nbsp;
Gail inclined her head and shifted her arms, urging Nina to do something
and Nina saw what she had to do.&nbsp; Quickly, she assumed the same position,
tightly holding her hands behind herself even though she would much rather
have held them in front.
<p>Dane looked at her for a moment, her own legs apart and then turned
to the crowd.&nbsp; "You're all witnesses here; did she ask to join CoRTN?"
<p>The men murmured assent, fascinated by the showdown between the cop
and the three naked chicks.
<p>Dana turned once more to Officer Frank.&nbsp; "You heard them, she's
one of ours.&nbsp; You going to bust her, and endanger her religious freedom?"
<p>Frank's face darkened.&nbsp; He was tempted to arrest Nina anyway; the
pat down would have been nice.&nbsp; But the Mayor had sent down news that
any harassment of the people of CoRTN would not be looked at favorably.&nbsp;
He didn't want any of his legal attempts to have the church shut down ruined.
<p>"Okay, then pack up your stuff.&nbsp; You're done for the day," he said,
able to do THAT much at least.
<p>There was a groan from the crowd, but Dana smiled.&nbsp; "We were done
anyway, Frank.&nbsp; Come on girls, let's load up."
<p>Frank and most of the other men watched Dana, Gail, and Nina load the
mostly empty flower baskets back into the bed of the pickup truck.&nbsp;
Nina figured these guys would have happily watched naked women doing anything,
and thought them a rather pathetic bunch.
<p>"How did you get here," Dana said to her, "did you drive?"
<p>"A friend dropped me," Nina said.
<p>Dana frowned.&nbsp; "Like that?&nbsp; No clothes at all?"
<p>Nina nodded, very aware of her nudity.
<p>"Are they still here?"
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; She assumed Helen was still watching, but
as much as she would have liked to, Nina couldn't go back to her.
<p>"We're heading back to the shrine," Dana said, "Officer numb nuts back
there is going to follow us to make sure we go there and no place else,
so we can't take you home.&nbsp; If you leave us now or before we enter
the compound, then he's probably going to nail you for indecent exposure.&nbsp;
Come with us though, and you'll be initiated tonight into CoRTN.&nbsp;
Make sure you know which direction you want to go in, both will change
your life."
<p>Nina looked Dana right in the eye.&nbsp; "I want to go with you."
<p>Dana stared back a moment, and then nodded.&nbsp; "Okay then."
<p>All three rode up front in the truck.&nbsp; Unlike other drives Nina
had taken in the nude, this time she made the effort not to scrunch down
and hide herself.&nbsp; She sat upright between Gail and Dana in full view
of oncoming traffic, while behind them cruised Officer Frank.&nbsp; Nina
closed her eyes from time to time, hoping they didn't drive by anyone who
could recognize her, and she resisted the urge to look back to see if Helen
was following them.&nbsp; She also tried to remain as still and as tiny
as possible, because she could feel the bare hips and shoulders of her
two new acquaintances against HER bare shoulders and hips.&nbsp; It only
served to emphasis her nudity...THEIR nudity, and the tube inside didn't
help matters.
<p>She got rather puzzled though, as the drive went on.&nbsp; Instead of
heading out of town to some secluded valley where everyone could run around
nude in peace, they drove through town and entered a light industrial area
full of factories and storage companies.&nbsp; They pulled to a gate in
a high brick wall, and waited for a moment for someone inside to open it.&nbsp;
Over the gate was a sign.&nbsp; "Church of Redemption Through Nudity".
<p>"Is this it?" Nina asked, somewhat taken back by the crude environment.
<p>"Yes, didn't you know?" Dana said from the driver's seat.
<p>"No.&nbsp; I'm...new in town."
<p>Dana glanced at her curiously and drove through the now open gate.&nbsp;
Gail gave Nina a smile, somewhat tinged with relief.
<p>Inside there was lots of room to park, and Nina saw a large, but low
lying building surround by parking lot and grass.&nbsp; At one end was
a children's playground but no children were present.
<p>Scattered here and there were women, all nude, doing various jobs such
as gardening, painting, or just relaxing.&nbsp; There were several robed
figures among them as well, Nina was surprised to see.&nbsp; One of them
walked up to where Dana had parked the truck, and when he pulled back his
hood, Nina resigned herself to being stared at by yet another man.
<p>"Hi, Dana," he said.&nbsp; "How did it go today?"
<p>"The usual.&nbsp; Here's the money."&nbsp; Dana handed him a small metal
cash box.
<p>The man took it and looked at Nina.&nbsp; "Hi, I'm Andrew.&nbsp; I don't
think we've met."
<p>"You wouldn't have.&nbsp; She came up to us at the lot and asked to
join.&nbsp; Frank made some noises, so I felt I had to bring her," Dana
said.
<p>Andrew raised his eyebrows in surprise.&nbsp; "That's unusual.&nbsp;
Did you make her strip too?"
<p>"No, that's how she came.&nbsp; Her name is Nina."
<p>"Wow!&nbsp; Well hi, Nina.&nbsp; Welcome to the shrine of the Church
of Redemption Through Nudity!&nbsp; Glad you could join us.&nbsp; Why don't
you step on out here so we can get a look at you."
<p>Gail had gotten out her side of the truck and had joined a couple of
other nude young women in unloading what was left of the stock.&nbsp; So
Nina gingerly slid out of her seat and walked around to where Andrew could
take a look at her.
<p>"My, you are a beauty," he said with a smile, making Nina blush.&nbsp;
"You say you want to join us?"
<p>"Yes...yes, I do," Nina replied.
<p>"Why?"
<p>"I...believe, what you believe," she said.
<p>Andrew raised an eyebrow and gave her another look over.&nbsp; "Well,
I can see from your tan that you spend a lot of time outside nude, so I
doubt it's a problem for you.&nbsp; But I get the impression you'd rather
not be here."
<p>Nina started to panic.&nbsp; Were they going to ask her to leave?
<p>"No...Please.&nbsp; I DO want to be here.&nbsp; I NEED to!"
<p>"You need to, huh?"&nbsp; Andrew sighed.&nbsp; "Well, we'll see.&nbsp;
Gail!"
<p>Gail padded over, her young face glowing.&nbsp; "Yes, Andrew?"
<p>"Gail, take Nina and show her around.&nbsp; Explain to her what we are
and who we are."
<p>"But Dana could do that better, Andrew."
<p>Andrew gave her a sharp look.&nbsp; "I want you to do it.&nbsp; You're
still a first level; you can relate better."
<p>"Yes, Andrew."&nbsp; Gail took Nina's unresisting hand and led her away,
leaving Dana and Andrew to talk about the newcomer.
<p>They walked across the lot, the tarmac hot under their feet until they
reached the grass, which felt a lot better to Nina.
<p>"So, any questions?" Gail asked with a smile.
<p>"Doesn't that come after the tour?" Nina said.
<p>Gail laughed.&nbsp; "Sure, but I bet you have a few now!"
<p>That Nina did, but she didn't know how deep she wanted to know these
people.&nbsp; "Er...yeah."
<p>"Well, go on!"
<p>"How come...how come Andrew had clothes?&nbsp; I see a few people here
with robes, like monks.&nbsp; I thought nudity was the religion."
<p>"It is, but not for men.&nbsp; Only women can aspire and achieve enlightenment
by freeing their bodies and their minds."
<p>"Only women?&nbsp; You mean that only the men wear clothes?" Nina asked.
<p>"Of course!&nbsp; It's strange, I know, but men have such a different
body image of themselves; that means the path to enlightenment is different
for them."
<p>"How different?" asked Nina.
<p>"That's something you will learn as you pass through the stages.&nbsp;
Me, I'm just a first level, which you will be when you are initiated tonight.&nbsp;
It means I have sworn off all clothing, never to wear them again, and I
can't use anything to cover myself.&nbsp; I'm almost done working through
the second stage, and when I have completed it, I'll be off probation and
become a Novitiate."
<p>"Yes, that's what I want, what I feel is right.&nbsp; No more clothes,
ever," Nina lied.
<p>"I'm glad you said that.&nbsp; It's such a wonderful feeling, isn't
it?"&nbsp; Gail smiled at her and Nina couldn't help smiling back.&nbsp;
To be honest, Nina knew that there were times when she found being nude
to be intensely pleasurable.&nbsp; But a lot of the time it was just humiliating.
<p>She looked around at the strange building they were walking around.&nbsp;
"What is this place?&nbsp; What did it used to be?"
<p>"It used to be a school, but Roy bought it and turned it into CoRTN.&nbsp;
It's only temporary, though.&nbsp; When he wins his court case, we'll finally
be allowed to practice our religion in public, as it should be.&nbsp; Then
we can all live where we want.&nbsp; The walls will come down."
<p>"It won't bother you to walk around naked anywhere in town?" Nina asked.
<p>"Of course not!&nbsp; Modesty denies enlightenment; it stops you from
feeling free and pure.&nbsp; Purity through Nudity!"
<p>Gail didn't look entirely convinced, though, and Nina suspected there
was still a little modesty left in the girl.
<p>"How long have you been here?" she asked.
<p>"About four months.&nbsp; I got out of isolation only a month ago, though,
and it still feels good to get out."
<p>"Isolation?" Nina said, feeling alarmed.
<p>"Yes.&nbsp; It's part of the initiation.&nbsp; Tonight when you're initiated,
you'll go through the ceremony of cleansing in which everything you brought
is taken from you.&nbsp; You will then be marked as a probationary devotee,"
she pointed at the ring in her nose, "by Roy, and then taken nude to isolation,
where you will spend three months emptying your mind of all the clutter
and morality that binds you and keeps you from being free."
<p>"What?" Nina was really alarmed now.&nbsp; "You mean they lock you up?"
<p>"Just for three months.&nbsp; It was hard, but I really do feel better
for it now that I'm out.&nbsp; Don't worry about it!"
<p>Nina did.&nbsp; She tried to change the subject a little.&nbsp; "You
said Roy, is that Roy Jones, the guy who runs this place?"
<p>"Oh yeah.&nbsp; Roy.&nbsp; He's a special guy.&nbsp; Really caring.&nbsp;
He spends a lot of time with the upper level devotees, helping them to
enlightenment by relieving them of all their inhibitions.&nbsp; Very dedicated.&nbsp;
We're lucky to have him."
<p>Nina figured he would be dedicated, knowing that he could any of these
women do anything he wanted them to do once he trained them up.&nbsp; Nina
felt quite disgusted.
<p>"Can I meet him?&nbsp; I'd like to see him before tonight," Nina said,
knowing that as soon as she did she would be out of here.
<p>"I don't think so.&nbsp; He's in seclusion, working on a revision of
our mantra.&nbsp; Only the men, and the level 6 and 7 devotees can see
him.&nbsp; But he always comes to assembly."
<p>"Assembly?"
<p>"It's...sort of like our group prayer time.&nbsp; It's when we show
our devotion to CoRTN and our progress toward enlightenment."
<p>Nina wondered if she wanted to know any more.&nbsp; As they walked,
Nina spotted one woman walking toward them on the path.&nbsp; She walked
slowly, her legs spread wider than normal, her hands held behind her.&nbsp;
On her face was a happy smile, and on her body were several piercings.&nbsp;
Her nose, nipples, clitoris, and labia were all pierced with rings, large
rings.&nbsp; But that wasn't all.&nbsp; A silver chain passed through all
these rings, connecting them together.&nbsp; Nina shuddered.
<p>"That's Cathy," Gail said in an almost reverential tone.&nbsp; "She's
a level 7, enlightened.&nbsp; There's only her and Linda right now, but
soon there will be more."
<p>"She has a lot of...jewelry," said Nina.
<p>"Yes, it's our badge of honor, how we show the levels we have achieved.&nbsp;
I just have the one ring; I'm level one.&nbsp; Dana has three, so you know
she's level three working on her fourth.&nbsp; Cathy has six rings, and
the chain linking them all is symbolic of the unity of her enlightenment,
the coming together of all that she has learned."
<p>While Nina listened to Gail prattle on about her so-called religion,
she watched as one of the men walked up to Cathy and stopped her.&nbsp;
He immediately placed one hand on her bare mons and began rubbing, bending
low to suckle on a nipple.&nbsp; Through all this, Cathy just smiled and
took it, never once commenting or showing any discomfort about being felt
up in such a public place.&nbsp; The man stood after a few minutes and
took hold of her chain.&nbsp; He began to walk, and Cathy hurried to follow,
anxious not to be pulled too hard in those sensitive places.&nbsp; The
couple walked away from Nina and Gail, and when Cathy turned, Nina could
see why her hands were behind her.&nbsp; They were cuffed.
<p>"What's with the handcuffs?" Nina asked.
<p>Gail shrugged, but Nina could see a little worry in her eyes.&nbsp;
"I expect someone just wanted her hands cuffed.&nbsp; A level 7 denies
nothing, has total freedom."
<p>Nina bit her lip, biting back a snide reply.
<p>"Come on, let me show you the inside," Gail said.
<p>Gail took Nina on a tour of the building.&nbsp; It had been an elementary
school at one point, and Nina saw evidence of that in the layout of the
building.&nbsp; The bigger classrooms had been turned into dorms, and Nina
saw that there were no doors on these rooms.&nbsp; Even the bathrooms had
no doors, and inside, all the stalls had been taken out, exposing the fixtures.&nbsp;
Nina tried not to stare as women openly used the facilities in front of
her, their piercings showing what level of 'enlightenment' they had achieved.
<p>Dinner was served in the cafeteria of course, with everyone sitting
at large tables, chatting with each other.&nbsp; Nina just pushed her food
around, nervous amongst all the exposed flesh even though she was exposing
just as much as they were.&nbsp; She was continually conscious of the tube
inside her and wished that Roy Jones would put in an appearance so that
she could serve those papers on him.
<p>She didn't see Dana and Andrew sitting at another table together, watching
her.
<p>Gail stayed with her, endlessly talking about how good she had it here,
how CoRTN had saved her life and gave meaning to it.&nbsp; She spouted
what sounded to Nina like corporate slogans, little sound bites of wisdom
designed to entrap the listener into buying what Roy Jones was selling.&nbsp;
Nina wasn't buying, but it was hard to miss the sales pitch, so hard was
it thrown.&nbsp; All around the room, all around the building to be honest,
were posters with little phrases on them.&nbsp; "Purity through Nudity"
being the most common.
<p>Yet from what Nina could see, these people were happy.&nbsp; None of
the women looked like they were being victimized, abused, or degraded.&nbsp;
Even the ones that had open sexual contact while the meal was eaten acted
like it was just a part of how things went now.&nbsp; Nina saw no outrage.
<p>After the meal, Gail announced it was assembly time, and she led Nina
to the assembly hall.&nbsp; This used to be the gym, and someone had built
a sign for over the door.&nbsp; "Nudity IS Purity!"
<p>As they entered the room, Nina got an idea just how many people were
involved with this religion.&nbsp; Over 150 women, all nude and pierced
to some degree, entered the room.&nbsp; Another 30 or so men in robes also
came in, standing against the walls as if herding the women into a corral.
<p>On a stage at the front of the room was a podium, lit from above by
a spotlight.&nbsp; There was also a comfortable looking recliner sitting
to one side, also lit up.
<p>Once everyone was in, a robed figure came in from behind the stage and
mounted it.&nbsp; He tossed back his hood and stood behind the podium,
smiling.
<p>"That's Roy," whispered Gail.
<p>Nina nodded and was about to press through the crowd when Roy spoke
up.&nbsp; "Hi everyone; please be seated!"
<p>All the women began to sit on the cold wooden floor and Nina was pulled
down gently by Gail.&nbsp; Nina dropped to a kneeling position, one that
modestly gave her the best coverage, but to a woman everyone else sat directly
on the hard floor and crossed their legs.&nbsp; Gail made a face at Nina,
and with a sigh, Nina complied.&nbsp; Sitting naked and cross-legged, Nina
felt doubly exposed.&nbsp; Her knees were so wide apart that her pussy
was clearly visible to the entire room.&nbsp; That was the purpose, Nina
figured.&nbsp; Purity through nudity...yay!
<p>Looking down, she could see that this position caused her labia to part;
the tube she carried was now visible.&nbsp; Hoping no one would see, Nina
reached down and tried to push it further in.
<p>"Wow," said Gail next to her, "you're really into this, that's great.&nbsp;
I'm still trying to work up the courage to openly masturbate."
<p>"What?" Nina said, blushing at being seen.
<p>Gail gestured about the room and Nina became conscious for the first
time of many of the women rubbing themselves.&nbsp; It appeared to be normal,
for no one was looking in disapproval at anyone who was doing it.&nbsp;
In fact, Nina got a few encouraging smiles from the women around her.
<p>Nina paled and almost pulled her hand away.&nbsp; But the tube was threatening
to pop right out of her unless Nina kept pushing it back.&nbsp; So she
sat there blushing furiously, knowing how she looked and not able to do
anything about it.
<p>Roy Jones began talking, spouting much of what Gail had been saying
at dinner.&nbsp; Stuff about how clothes hid women and forced roles on
them.&nbsp; How women who wore clothes were way too absorbed by fashion
and how it looked to be open to freeing their minds and their bodies.&nbsp;
How only through nudity, with all of their possessions gone, all their
inhibitions wiped away, was it possible to be free.
<p>Nina listened and wondered if she ought to just get up and make a run
for it.&nbsp; She could easily skip past the women in front of her to make
it to Roy's side.&nbsp; Then all she had to do was pull the tube out and
hand him the papers rolled tightly inside.&nbsp; But Nina couldn't move.
<p>Roy finished his sermon and then started calling for the devotees to
show their "devotion."
<p>Immediately, the level 1 girls, Gail included, stood up.&nbsp; Nina
watched as Gail and the others stood with their arms out away from their
bodies.&nbsp; They turned slowly in a full circle while chanting "I forswear
all that can cover me, all that can hide me from the truth, all that can
come between me and enlightenment.&nbsp; Purity through Nudity!"
<p>They sat down and the level two girls stood and did the same thing.&nbsp;
Their chant was "I forswear my modesty, I am not ashamed of my body, I
am proud that it can be seen by all.&nbsp; Purity through Nudity!"
<p>Dana stood up with the level 3 women, of which there were fewer but
still a significant number.&nbsp; "I forswear my privacy, my right to be
hidden.&nbsp; No more will I hide or be permitted to hide, anything I do.&nbsp;
Purity through Nudity!"
<p>Level 4 stood up and stood like the others had.&nbsp; "I encourage all
to look at me, to take in my beauty, to see my freedom.&nbsp; Purity through
Nudity!"
<p>Then came level 5.&nbsp; Unlike the previous levels, these women did
not stand arms wide.&nbsp; Instead, their left hands rubbed their bare
pussies while their right hands pinched nipples.&nbsp; "I forswear my right
not to be touched.&nbsp; I encourage any and all to hold me and caress
me so that I may know the intimacy of exposure and the freedom it gives.&nbsp;
Purity through Nudity!"
<p>Level 6 carried it further when their turn came.&nbsp; They didn't just
rub, they penetrated, and it wasn't themselves they penetrated, but other
members of their level.&nbsp; "I encourage all to use me, to take my body
and free my mind.&nbsp; I cherish the freedom it brings to be one with
another.&nbsp; Purity through Nudity!"
<p>Then, only two stood up.&nbsp; One of them Nina recognized to be Cathy,
the other had to be Linda.&nbsp; They stood together at the front and turned
to the room.&nbsp; "This girl forswears herself, her petty ego, her puny
pride, her insignificant identity.&nbsp; This girl revels in the freedom
of total obedience, of never needing to think, just be.&nbsp; Redemption
through Nudity!"
<p>Cathy and Linda remained standing and a hush fell over the crowd.&nbsp;
Nina stared in spite of herself, feeling sick at what she had just seen
but unable to look away.&nbsp; She watched as Roy walked between the two
women and gave them a kiss each before sending them to two of the other
men.&nbsp; Each of those men turned the women around and proceeded to fuck
them right there.
<p>Nina closed her eyes.
<p>Roy took the podium again and continued his sermon, talking about how
proud he was of all of them.&nbsp; While he talked, Cathy and Linda were
passed from man to man, being fucked by each of them in turn.&nbsp; The
ones who were already done walked out among the women, and each found a
Level 6 to fondle.&nbsp; One or two of them had sex as well.
<p>Nina sat still, unable to believe what she was seeing, but the heavy
scent of feminine musk was in the air and hard to deny.&nbsp; What made
it worse for her was, despite her disgust at how mindless these women were
becoming, she was physically reacting to the erotic atmosphere.&nbsp; She
was sure that it was partially the fault of the tube in her pussy, its
presence already arousing her to some base degree.&nbsp; But the lustful
moans and the smell were affecting her as well.
<p>She wasn't the only one.&nbsp; She could see many of the lower level
women gazing enviously at the sexual goings on.
<p>She was startled when she heard her name.
<p>"Nina?&nbsp; Can you hear me?" said Roy from the stage.
<p>"What?...Oh yes!" Nina said, blushing as she was singled out.
<p>Roy smiled.&nbsp; "I can see that the atmosphere of this place has already
captured you.&nbsp; Welcome to the shrine.&nbsp; It is time for your initiation
into our church.&nbsp; Are you ready?"
<p>Nina wanted to bolt, to run from here as fast as she could.&nbsp; But
to do so was to waste all that she had gone through to reach this point.&nbsp;
So she nodded and stood.&nbsp; A couple of the men came over to her and
led her over to the stage.&nbsp; They stood her next to Roy and moved away.
<p>'Now,' Nina thought, 'do it now!'
<p>After giving the nude Nina a look over so deep that she blushed as fully
as she had ever done before, Roy turned to his flock and began to speak
of the joys of initiation.&nbsp; This was the opening Nina needed and she
reached down for the tube.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while it had been practically
popping into her hand while she sat, now that she was standing it had gone
deep again.&nbsp; Her face hot with shame as she dug into her pussy in
front of all these people, Nina's slippery fingers tried to grasp the end
of the tube and pull it free.
<p>Roy noticed her penetrating herself, and made a joke to the crowd about
her enthusiasm and how maybe she could skip a few levels.&nbsp; People
laughed and Nina managed a fake smile, but when she looked in Roy's eyes
she saw a deep lust there she didn't want to face first hand.
<p>Her fingers caught the end of the tube and she drew it out in one smooth
motion.&nbsp; The feel of it leaving her almost shocked her into orgasm,
and she barely hung on.
<p>Roy had turned back to the crowd so he didn't see the extraction and
didn't see Nina fighting with the slippery lid.&nbsp; Others did though,
and the two men that had brought Nina on stage moved hesitantly toward
her.&nbsp; They weren't in time though, for Nina popped the top off and
pulled out the papers inside.&nbsp; One quick shake and they were unfolded
and Nina handed them out to Roy, who took them automatically.
<p>"ROY JONES," Nina said loudly,&nbsp; "YOU HAVE BEEN SERVED!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was dark outside now, the assembly, and Roy's speeches having taken
a lot of time.
<p>A gate opened in a brick wall, and from inside could be heard a female
voice.&nbsp; "Stop it!&nbsp; Let me go!&nbsp; You CAN'T just throw me out;
I'm naked!&nbsp; PLEASE!&nbsp; At least give me something to wear!"&nbsp;
Two men appeared with a struggling woman between them.&nbsp; They propelled
her past the gate and hurried back, closing it after them.&nbsp; Nina West,
the propelled woman, ran back to the gate but it was locked.&nbsp; "Damn
it!" she swore.&nbsp; Then she crouched down and looked around, fearful
of who could see her in her nudity.&nbsp; There was no cover to be had,
the wall stretching away on both sides of her, but it didn't matter, Nina
didn't see a soul.
<p>Trembling, she remained crouched.&nbsp; She didn't want to move, scared
that to move meant to be seen.&nbsp; But she knew she couldn't stay there.&nbsp;
Then she remembered that Helen was supposed to be waiting for her and she
looked around for the familiar car.&nbsp; But Helen was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;
The street was deserted.
<p>Nina wished she knew what time it was, but of course, she had no watch.&nbsp;
She knew that she was in an unknown part of town with absolutely nothing
to her name.&nbsp; No wonder she was scared.&nbsp; At least Roy Jones hadn't
done anything to her.&nbsp; After looking at the papers, he just ordered
her tossed out, a scowl on his face.&nbsp; Even young Gail had looked at
her angrily.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; She didn't know what to do.&nbsp; Should she wait
here naked on the street in case Helen showed up, or go find some cover
somewhere?&nbsp; Nina wondered if she would have to make her own way home
and shuddered.&nbsp; At the very least, she had to find a phone.
<p>She got up and nervously began padding down the sidewalk.&nbsp; She
kept looking around, waiting for someone to see her.&nbsp; She felt very
vulnerable out there naked and alone, and hoped she could stay safe.&nbsp;
She thought about whom she could call, Helen, Brian...Jim.&nbsp; At the
thought of Jim, Nina smiled.&nbsp; 'HE would probably get a kick out of
this, me walking through an industrial park, naked,' Nina thought.
<p>She hoped to find a phone, but that was proving to be difficult.&nbsp;
She left the shrine behind and began making her way along the different
streets, ducking from cover to cover.&nbsp; Once in a while, a car would
drive by and Nina would hide.&nbsp; She looked at the car carefully though,
in case it was Helen, and was ready to jump up in a second if it was, but
no luck.&nbsp; She got a shock at one point when a patrol car drove by.&nbsp;
Nina hesitated, thinking maybe that being picked up by the police might
not be so bad, but then wondered if it was that cop from earlier in the
day.&nbsp; Nina had no wish being under THAT man's power, so she stayed
hidden.&nbsp; She saw the patrol car a couple more times as she snuck around,
but she had no idea where she was going or what direction to take.
<p>Then her luck changed.&nbsp; A phone booth, next to what looked like
a city bus stop.&nbsp; Both were empty of course, and Nina figured it must
be late, but the phone booth was one of those glass ones and well lighted.&nbsp;
To use it, Nina would have to step inside in full view of any cars that
drove by.
<p>Nina crouched behind a trashcan for a moment, thinking of what to do.&nbsp;
She decided she had no choice.&nbsp; She ran across the road and entered
the phone booth.&nbsp; Of course she had no money on her, she hoped she
could make a collect call.
<p>She tried to think of Brian's number, but her mind went blank, so she
dialed the operator and tried to place a call through to Helen.&nbsp; While
she waited, she kept an eye on the road and knew that if a car came around
a nearby corner, she would have no chance of hiding.&nbsp; There was no
cover nearby.
<p>She could hear the phone ringing at the other end, and Nina wondered
where Helen WAS!&nbsp; Nina was rather pissed at her friend right now,
the day catching up with her.&nbsp; Helen should have been there!
<p>"I'm sorry, there is no answer," said the operator, so Nina had her
dial Jim's number.
<p>As the phone started ringing, Nina's fear came true.&nbsp; Around the
corner drove a car, and for a few seconds Nina's nude body was completely
lit up by its headlights.
<p>"Hello?" said a male voice on the phone.
<p>"Will you accept a collect call from...Nina West?" asked the operator.&nbsp;
Nina watched the car drive by and slow down.
<p>"Sure," said the voice.
<p>"Jim?&nbsp; Is that you?" Nina said quickly, watching the car.
<p>"Sure is, I'm on the cordless.&nbsp; What's up?"
<p>The car stopped and sat, its brake lights lit up.
<p>"Jim, I'm in trouble, I need help!"
<p>"What is it, Nina?&nbsp; What's going on?" Jim asked, concern in his
voice.
<p>"I can't explain now.&nbsp; Just come to..."&nbsp; Nina looked around,
spotted the name of a business on the side of a building, and told him.&nbsp;
"And hurry!&nbsp; I'm naked and lost!"
<p>"Are you and Kelly playing some sort of game?" chuckled Jim.
<p>The car started to back up.
<p>"No, this is serious.&nbsp; I'm in trouble.&nbsp; PLEASE come quick!&nbsp;
There's a car here; they've seen me.&nbsp; I have to go!"
<p>"Nina wait!&nbsp; What's going..."
<p>Nina hung up on him and struggled with the door to the phone booth.&nbsp;
It opened and she darted out just as the car pulled along side.&nbsp; She
ran as fast as she could for the building she had named for Jim.
<p>"Hey, Lady!" called out a voice from the car, "Where ya going, beautiful?"
<p>Helen stepped up her speed and was suddenly backlit.&nbsp; The car had
swung into the driveway she was running on and was following her.
<p>Panicked, Nina changed direction.&nbsp; There were a few trees, some
landscaping for the front of the building.&nbsp; She hoped she could make
it.
<p>What saved her was the car stopping, its driver wondering if he should
jump the curb while his passenger urged him to.&nbsp; In the end, he did
so, but his hesitation cost him as Nina made it to the trees.
<p>Breathing heavily but evenly, the nude and now sweating girl ran through
the small grove, emerging on the other side next to the building.&nbsp;
She didn't stop, determined to put as much distance as she could between
herself and the car, and continued to run.&nbsp; Around a corner she went
and onwards.
<p>The car had to drive around the trees, and by the time they did so,
their lights only barely caught Nina's bare ass as she rounded the corner.
<p>"That way," said the passenger.
<p>Nina continued to run, one arm now across her chest as her bouncing
breasts were becoming painful, her feet hurting from hitting hard concrete.&nbsp;
But she didn't stop and continued to run around the building.&nbsp; She
didn't want to get too far from it, for this was where Jim was coming to
save her.
<p>It wasn't until she had run all the way around that Nina saw the car
again.&nbsp; She had just reached the trees once more, and she saw it on
the other side of them, doubling back.
<p>"Shit!" she said breathlessly and she stopped running.&nbsp; She looked
wildly around for a place to hide and saw only the trees, which were too
far apart on the manicured lawn to provide much cover.&nbsp; But there
was another option.
<p>She looked up, and with a mental shrug, she ran for the nearest tree.
<p>Nina was twenty feet above the ground by the time the car drove by.&nbsp;
She froze, hugging the trunk and thinking invisible thoughts, aware of
the rough bark against her bare breasts and stomach.&nbsp; She looked down
and didn't move as the car stopped and waited.
<p>It seemed to stay for a long time before driving off.&nbsp; In fact,
it circled the building a few times, and every time Nina figured it had
gone it came back.
<p>She was tired, thirsty, and getting cold, and only wanted to go home.&nbsp;
But as she waited, she found that her fear had turned to something else,
excitement.&nbsp; Yes, she was still scared of being found, but as she
had time to think about it, she discovered the fear was much like the kind
you get riding a big roller coaster for the first time.&nbsp; Nina was
surprised at herself, and wondered what it meant.
<p>She saw lights down below and saw a car pull in.&nbsp; At first, she
thought it was her tormentors again, but then recognized it as Jim's.&nbsp;
She scrambled down the tree as fast as she could while not scraping herself
up, and made a mad run for the car.
<p>Jim was just about to drive off looking for her when he saw her coming.&nbsp;
He got out of the car and stared in amazement at the beautiful nude woman
running toward him, and felt his own arousal rise.&nbsp; In seconds she
was upon him and hugging him tightly, sobbing a little.
<p>"Oh Jim, I'm glad it's you!" she said.
<p>"What's going on, Nina, what are you doing way out here?"
<p>"Let's go, I'll tell you on the way.&nbsp; Please?"
<p>Jim nodded and he and Nina climbed back in the car.
<p>Nina felt the tension and the strange excitement of the moment leave
her as she explained her day.&nbsp; She didn't mention her excitement to
Jim, she wanted to figure it out for herself, but she was safe at last.
<p>The naked girl hugged Jim all the way home.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 20, A Day Out.
<p>Nina West sat waiting in the lobby of Brian Cook's home.&nbsp; She was
alone, having spurned Helen's company after the fiasco of the night before.&nbsp;
Nina knew deep down that it was silly of her to be mad at Helen for letting
her down at the CoRTN compound, but a part of her still couldn't forgive
the woman, despite the fact it hadn't been her fault, or so she said.
<p>Helen told her that she had been chased away from CoRTN by a cop who
didn't want anyone parked around that area.&nbsp; After trying several
times to find a place where she could watch for Nina to come out, Helen
had been forced to leave under penalty of arrest.&nbsp; She had ended up
having to just drive in big circles around the neighborhood and only bad
timing had caused her to miss Nina's exit.
<p>Helen felt terrible about it, and Nina accepted her apology and explanation.&nbsp;
But Nina still felt she needed to get away from Helen for a day to calm
down.&nbsp; Luckily, her boss, Sarah Wickland, gave both Nina and Helen
the rest of the week off while she was out of town on business.
<p>So Nina called Jim and asked if he was doing anything; he wasn't, so
they decided to spend the day together.
<p>Now she sat waiting in the lobby while Jim was upstairs with Brian.&nbsp;
Immediately upon Jim's arrival, Brian had taken him upstairs to his studio,
asking Nina to wait for them.
<p>Nina hugged her nude body and wondered what the two of them were talking
about.
<p>"Oh, it was just about delivery of your statue," Jim told her when he
eventually rejoined her.&nbsp; He held her and gave her a quick kiss that
Nina rather enjoyed.
<p>"You were up there a while," Nina said, letting his arms envelope her.&nbsp;
Nina felt better when in his arms, despite the fact that she was nude and
he wasn't.&nbsp; She felt protected, almost clothed.&nbsp; Nina was learning
to trust Jim, and there were many other feelings that she was still trying
to sort out.
<p>"Sure.&nbsp; Proper arrangements take time.&nbsp; Now, come on, a big
day ahead of us!"
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "What do you have planned?"
<p>"Oh, just a drive up to Uncle's cabin, maybe a trip into town for dinner
tonight.&nbsp; You game?"
<p>Nina nodded and the couple started to walk out.&nbsp; But Nina's eye
caught someone watching them through one of the many mirrors that decorated
the house.&nbsp; It was Helen, nude herself because Brian had claimed another
of her hours that morning.&nbsp; She was half hiding herself and looking
directly at Nina and Jim.&nbsp; She must have realized that Nina had spotted
her, because she moved and disappeared from view.
<p>Nina wondered what was going through her mind, but was soon caught up
in Jim's exuberance and forgot about her friend.
<p>Jim's car was parked right in front, but Nina ignored it and started
to walk down the driveway, until Jim stopped her.
<p>"Here," he said, opening the passenger door, "I'll drive you."
<p>Nina didn't think she needed a ride to the gatehouse to get some clothes,
but his smile convinced her to climb into the car.&nbsp; She had just sat
down when out of the house bounced Kelly.&nbsp; The young woman was still
nude, as she had been for weeks now.&nbsp; She had by now broken her old
record, and every day for her was another notch on her belt...had she worn
one.
<p>"Jim!" she cried, "Wait up!"
<p>Jim chuckled and stood by the car as Kelly ran down the steps.&nbsp;
She tackled Jim and the two of them hugged, making Nina frown a little.&nbsp;
Suddenly Nina didn't want Kelly around Jim.
<p>"Jim, no one told me you were here; where you guys going?" Kelly said,
grinning form ear to ear.
<p>"Oh, no place special.&nbsp; Just out to the cabin," Jim replied.
<p>"Oooo!&nbsp; Can I come along?&nbsp; I'm getting kinda bored hanging
around here."
<p>Jim laughed and Nina opened her eyes in alarm.&nbsp; "You could always
go shopping or something," Jim told her.
<p>Kelly pouted.&nbsp; "I wish!"&nbsp; In fact, Nina had noticed for a
little while now that Kelly was getting a little less enthusiastic about
her self enforced nudity.&nbsp; Ever since she got here, she had been spending
time either with friends or at the house.&nbsp; Places you could go nude
were somewhat limited, and over the last few weeks, Kelly had exhausted
them all.&nbsp; Nina thought that Kelly was about to give up and get dressed;
after all, she had broken her previous record of longest time nude.&nbsp;
But Jim knew otherwise.&nbsp; Knowing Kelly better, Jim knew that when
she got like this it was a sign that she was ready to start taking some
much bigger risks, where she almost dared the cops to arrest her.
<p>Jim only hoped he would be there when Kelly finally let go.
<p>Jim lifted up the slim, nude woman, holding her high in the air with
his strong arms.
<p>"Tell you what, Kel'," he said.&nbsp; "Next time.&nbsp; Okay, Honey?&nbsp;
Nina and I want some time alone."
<p>Kelly wriggled in the air and almost pouted.&nbsp; "Okay."
<p>Jim laughed and put her down.&nbsp; "You could always do something with
Nina's friend Helen!"
<p>Kelly frowned, then her expression changed to something more thoughtful.&nbsp;
"You know, you're right!&nbsp; Have fun guys!" she said, scampering away.
<p>Jim climbed into the driver's seat.
<p>"You set Kelly loose on Helen?" Nina asked, hoping Helen was up to it.
<p>"Sure.&nbsp; You said she let you down last night.&nbsp; What better
revenge?"&nbsp; Jim smiled and started the car, turning it around in the
driveway.
<p>"Well, in Helen's defense, it wasn't her fault."&nbsp; Nina went on
to explain what Helen had told HER.
<p>"Oh well," said Jim, "at least they will both stay occupied."
<p>Nina laughed.
<p>When they reached the end of the driveway, the gates opened and Jim
continued on without stopping.
<p>"Hey!" Nina said, turning around.&nbsp; "Wait, you have to stop!"
<p>"Why?" Jim asked, pulling into traffic.
<p>"I have to get some clothes!&nbsp; I can't go around like this!"
<p>Jim looked over at the nude Goddess sitting next to him and smiled.&nbsp;
"I can't think of a better way for you to go anywhere."
<p>"But I'm NAKED!" protested Nina.
<p>"I know!"
<p>Nina looked into his eyes and blushed.&nbsp; She slouched down in the
seat and covered herself.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "It's okay, it's not like we're really going anywhere.&nbsp;
You've driven nude to the cabin before.&nbsp; And this time you're in an
enclosed car with tinted windows, not a convertible.&nbsp; You'll be fine!"
<p>Nina knew that was true but it didn't make her feel much better.&nbsp;
"I would still have preferred to stop."
<p>Jim glanced at her, but other wise kept his eyes on the road.&nbsp;
"Nina, you're a very beautiful woman, inside and out.&nbsp; I'm still getting
to know the Nina inside, but I find I can't get enough of the Nina outside.&nbsp;
I don't care if I never see you in clothes, they would only detract from
your beauty.&nbsp; I chose to take you from your home as you are, because
I want to look at you just the way you are."
<p>Nina thought about that for a moment.&nbsp; "Well, maybe I would have
gotten undressed for you, but I would have liked to have had the choice."
<p>"Would you?"&nbsp; Jim said.&nbsp; "Would you really?&nbsp; Tell me,
Nina.&nbsp; Sitting there now, knowing that you couldn't cover yourself
up, knowing that you have nothing to clothe yourself with...isn't that
making your heart pump hard, your senses reel?&nbsp; Don't you feel more
excited than you would have been if you had a handy shirt in the back seat
in case of emergencies?"
<p>Nina couldn't answer that.&nbsp; It was true her body was very excited,
but she didn't know if it was from pleasure or from fear.
<p>Jim smiled, as if reading her thoughts.&nbsp; "Tell you what, let's
talk about it later.&nbsp; Sit back, relax, and enjoy the drive."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Inside Brian Cook's house, Kelly carefully searched each room.&nbsp;
She eventually found Helen upstairs in the sunroom, perversely the most
private public room of the house, despite its glass walls and ceiling.&nbsp;
Helen had been forbidden to stay in her room during her nude time; she
had to be out where anyone could run across her.
<p>Helen was settled on a couch, a magazine open on her lap, but she didn't
appear to be looking at it.&nbsp; Instead, she looked out past the glass
walls at the trees outside, deep in thought.
<p>Kelly paused near the top of the spiral staircase that was the only
way into the room, before smiling and continuing up.&nbsp; "Hi, Helen,"
she said.
<p>Helen jerked her head around and blushed.&nbsp; She looked down and
busied herself with her magazine.&nbsp; "Hi, Kelly."
<p>"What are you doing up here?" Kelly asked her, padding over to sit on
the couch.
<p>Helen looked up, and Kelly was surprised to see how embarrassed Helen
was.&nbsp; It wasn't as if it was the first time she and Helen had been
nude together, although Kelly had noticed that Helen usually stayed away
from her for some reason.
<p>"Something wrong?" Kelly asked her.
<p>"No, nothing," was the curt reply.&nbsp; Helen avoided looking Kelly
in the eye and returned to her magazine.
<p>Kelly moved a little closer and examined the way Helen was blushing.&nbsp;
She sniffed, and thought she smelled something familiar.&nbsp; "You know
that Jim and Nina have left for the day, don't you?" she said.
<p>Helen nodded, not looking away from her magazine that lay across her
lap.
<p>Kelly paused, noting how erect Helen's nipples were.&nbsp; "I guess
that leaves you and me, then!"
<p>Helen didn't say a word, and Kelly grinned.&nbsp; "I'm sure we'll find
something to do."
<p>"I have things to do," Helen said politely.
<p>Kelly shrugged.&nbsp; "Perhaps.&nbsp; But I figured that as we are both
in the same boat, we might as well get to know each other."
<p>"Same boat?" Helen asked, glancing up.
<p>"Sure!&nbsp; I know you pal around with Nina a lot, and I usually do
the same with Jim when I'm here.&nbsp; But since the two of them got together,
it hasn't been as much fun."
<p>Helen didn't answer, but her body language told the younger woman that
Helen had her thoughts regarding Jim and Nina being together.
<p>"Jim's quite a hunk though, isn't he?"&nbsp; Kelly said, watching Helen
carefully.&nbsp; "There was a time when I wondered if he and I...well,
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about."
<p>Helen nodded politely.
<p>Kelly moved a little closer.&nbsp; "But who can blame him, going after
Nina, she is very beautiful," she said quietly.&nbsp; "It almost takes
your breath away...looking at her," she whispered.
<p>There it was, that flush again, spreading slowly across Helen's face
and neck.&nbsp; Kelly took a deep breath, her nose picking up that fragrance
again.&nbsp; She smiled.&nbsp; "You like her, don't you," she said quietly.
<p>Helen stiffened, just a little.&nbsp; "Well...sure I do.&nbsp; She's
my friend," Helen said softly.
<p>Kelly reached out and put a hand on Helen's bare thigh.&nbsp; "No...I
mean...you LIKE her."
<p>Helen looked up like a scared rabbit before moving off the couch.&nbsp;
She headed for the stairs and went down without a word.
<p>Kelly grinned and lay down on the soft couch, her face where Helen had
been sitting.&nbsp; Kelly sniffed and nodded, having a pretty good idea
what else Helen had been doing up here.&nbsp; 'Yes', Kelly thought, 'maybe
Helen would be fun after all!'
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina and Jim spent a quiet day at the cabin his uncle owned.&nbsp; They
swam, they talked, they made love, getting to know each other as two people
at the beginning of love try to do.
<p>She got him to talk about his family, and Nina discovered how he was
able to afford to spend $80,000 on a statue of her.&nbsp; Jim's family
was old money, railroad riches diversified into construction, textiles,
and aerospace.&nbsp; Jim's personal wealth was impressive for someone still
in college, but he didn't brag about it.&nbsp; In fact, he seemed rather
ashamed of having so much, and Nina didn't push the subject.&nbsp; Instead,
he talked about his family, and Nina enjoyed the stories.
<p>"You'll have to meet my parents sometime," he said to her, toying with
one of her nipples as they lay in bed together.
<p>"I'd like that," Nina replied, her head on his shoulder, her hot sweaty
body hard against his.
<p>Jim turned to look at her and smiled.&nbsp; "Would you?&nbsp; Really?"
<p>Nina punched him.&nbsp; "Sure!&nbsp; Why shouldn't I?"
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "Okay then, I'll set it up."&nbsp; Then he leaned
over and kissed her.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina was showering outside, a shower head fastened to the wall of the
cabin pouring warm water all over her.&nbsp; She felt good, calm, relaxed,
unconcerned about how she was showering in front of the great outdoors
while there was a perfectly good bathroom inside.&nbsp; Her thoughts were
on Jim, and how their bodies had met that last time, his tenderness and
his passion.
<p>Nina grinned, worn out.
<p>She felt strong arms circle round her, hugging her to a naked male body.&nbsp;
"I'm never going to get cleaned up at this rate," she said, smiling.
<p>"Works for me," Jim replied, kissing the back of her neck.&nbsp; "I
find I can't resist the wet look!"
<p>Nina giggled.&nbsp; "Slow down, Lover.&nbsp; We have to eat sometime!"
<p>"I agree, which is why I'm taking you out to dinner."
<p>Nina turned to look at him, her soapy body making it easy to slide around.&nbsp;
"Taking me to dinner?&nbsp; You seem to forget that I have nothing to wear,
unless you have something for me here!"
<p>Jim grinned.&nbsp; "Oh I can never forget that you have nothing to wear,
but where we are going, it won't matter."
<p>"Jim," Nine said, suddenly feeling nervous again,&nbsp; "I...Can't we
just stay here?&nbsp; I'm not up for one of your games right now."
<p>"Aren't you?" he said.&nbsp; "I think you are.&nbsp; I think you enjoy
this more than you think, that you find an excitement, a thrill in being
nude, beyond what you grew up with."
<p>Nina looked uncertainly at him.&nbsp; "I don't know," she whispered.
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "That's right, you don't.&nbsp; And you'd like to
find out, wouldn't you?"
<p>Nina looked at him for a moment, water pouring down her back from the
showerhead.&nbsp; "Yes...I would."
<p>Jim held her face, a serious expression on his own, and he bent to kiss
her.&nbsp; "We'll find out together.&nbsp; In fact, before we go eat, let's
give you an adventure."
<p>Nina opened her mouth to protest but Jim put his finger across it, hushing
her.&nbsp; "It'll be fine, trust me.&nbsp; Now finish up and we'll go."
<p>Nina nodded.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina sat nervously in the car, her arms across her breasts, her knees
up.&nbsp; Her thoughts were full of the trial ahead, why she was doing
it, whether she was doing it at all!&nbsp; Despite the fact that she had
been forced into such things before, it still felt so very new, unpleasant.&nbsp;
Yet...
<p>She looked over at Jim who gave her an encouraging smile.
<p>"You're not trying to change me into Kelly are you?" Nina asked him.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "No, I couldn't do that even if I wanted to, which
I don't.&nbsp; You and Kelly are nothing alike.&nbsp; Kelly...well she
doesn't have much humility.&nbsp; She doesn't feel the shame that helps
people build a well-rounded personality.&nbsp; Most of the time I really
think that the only reason she doesn't go out in full public naked is her
fear of being arrested again.&nbsp; Otherwise, she'd do it, no matter who
was looking at her."
<p>Nina grunted.&nbsp; "Maybe she should join those crazies at CoRTN."
<p>"Na, she wouldn't want to be with those guys," Jim said.
<p>"Why not?&nbsp; Their religion IS nudity."
<p>"Yeah, with a lot of open sex thrown in as well from what you've told
me.&nbsp; That's not Kelly.&nbsp; She's open enough about showing off her
body, but I don't have enough fingers and toes for the number of guys she
has rejected."
<p>"Does that include you?" Nina asked, remembering the way he had picked
up Kelly earlier.
<p>"No, it doesn't.&nbsp; Kelly and I never did look at each other that
way.&nbsp; She's pretty enough, but not my type."
<p>"Not your type?&nbsp; A woman who wants nothing more than to go around
naked all the time isn't your type?" Nina said.
<p>Rather than grin, Jim frowned.&nbsp; "Like I said, she lacks humility.&nbsp;
You, on the other hand, carry buckets of it."
<p>"Buckets, huh?&nbsp; Is that a technical term, Doctor?"
<p>Jim's frown turned into a grin.&nbsp; When Nina had asked him what he
was going to do with himself in life, he had surprised her by telling her
he was pushing for a career track as a psychologist.
<p>"Yeah, very technical.&nbsp; Freud used it all the time."
<p>Nina giggled, relaxing a little.&nbsp; "So I'm full of humility."
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, and I trust you to know your limits because
of that."
<p>"And when we reach my limits, will you stop?" she asked.
<p>"Only if we can't discover how to expand them.&nbsp; But knowing your
limits means you know not to do anything stupid.&nbsp; I can trust you
to know when to back off.&nbsp; I can't trust Kelly anymore."
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; "If you can't trust her, why do you still think
up things for her to do, ways for her to streak?"
<p>Jim glanced over at her as he drove, silent for a moment.
<p>"You wouldn't have a way of knowing this, but these past few weeks I
haven't really done much with Kelly, not compared to past years.&nbsp;
And the things we did do, I tried to make sure she wasn't alone doing."
<p>"Why?"
<p>"Well...it's nothing.&nbsp; You're not her.&nbsp; Look, we're here."
<p>They had driven to the coast and dusk now hung over them, the sun below
the horizon while the sky still glowed.
<p>Jim pulled the car off the highway in a lay-by.&nbsp; "Wait here," he
said.
<p>Nina waited nervously while Jim got out and walked toward the ocean.&nbsp;
Just like at Buffalo Beach, the water here was at the bottom of a cliff,
and Jim disappeared over the edge, presumably following a path.
<p>Ten minutes later, he came back up, and in the dim light Nina could
see that he was smiling.&nbsp; He climbed back in the car.
<p>"I just had to make sure no one was about," he told her.&nbsp; "It's
all clear.&nbsp; Now, here's the plan."
<p>"Do I really have to do this?" Nina asked him, scared.
<p>"No, you don't have to do this.&nbsp; We could just go eat, maybe go
back to your place if you like.&nbsp; But I see in you a need to get this
done.&nbsp; Do you want to do this?"
<p>Nina held her breath.&nbsp; Did she?&nbsp; She didn't know, but she
didn't want to disappoint Jim, so she nodded.
<p>"Okay," he said, watching her.&nbsp; "Here's the plan.&nbsp; You follow
the path down to the beach; there's no one there so you'll be alone.&nbsp;
Turn left and follow the beach for about two miles.&nbsp; You'll see a
cell phone tower on the cliff, there is a path under it that you can use
to climb back to the top.&nbsp; All you have to do is walk from here to
there."
<p>"Naked," Nina said.
<p>Jim smiled.&nbsp; "Of course!"
<p>"Is the beach going to be deserted all the way?" she asked him.
<p>"I doubt it.&nbsp; There are several homes on the cliff between here
and there, but who knows if they will have people on the beach when you
need to get by.&nbsp; If you have to, you could always get in the water
and swim past them, but I'd rather you didn't.&nbsp; I'd like you to streak
past them, just run and wave.&nbsp; You'll be fine, and they will get a
cheap thrill."
<p>Nina didn't think much of that plan.&nbsp; "Okay," she said.
<p>"You DO trust me, don't you?" Jim said, holding her arm.
<p>Nina waited a beat, then nodded.&nbsp; So Jim leaned over and kissed
her.
<p>Nina responded and opened her door.&nbsp; Feet on the hard asphalt,
she turned to him and said, "You'd better take me someplace special for
dinner after doing this for you!"
<p>Jim laughed.&nbsp; "Go on now!"
<p>Nina, crouching low, made a mad dash for the path leading down the cliff
face.&nbsp; She looked back to see Jim's car pull back out onto the highway,
and sighed.&nbsp; She couldn't believe she was doing this.&nbsp; Out in
the middle of nowhere, no clothes, forced to walk at least two miles before
she would have any kind of safety, without knowing WHEN she might get to
wear clothes again.
<p>She hoped he had been kidding about taking her to dinner naked, but
had the sneaking suspicion he wasn't.&nbsp; She hoped they were going to
the restaurant at the Buffalo Resort.&nbsp; At least she had dined nude
there once before.
<p>Nina reached the bottom of the cliff and walked out onto the cooling
sand.&nbsp; Jim had been right, there wasn't anyone around, but she could
see lights coming on in the various houses between her and the cell tower,
which blinked a light of its own.
<p>Could she do this?&nbsp; What if she just waited here; how long before
Jim came back to look for her?
<p>But Nina felt she couldn't do that to Jim, or to herself.&nbsp; So,
the naked girl began walking.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It went better than Nina had hoped.&nbsp; She stuck close to the cliff
until full darkness fell, although a nearly full moon lit up the ocean
to her right.&nbsp; After that, she walked more confidently out on the
beach, and only had to hide a couple of times when she saw people.
<p>One thing she couldn't do was streak, running past them as if her not
having clothes didn't bother her.&nbsp; It DID bother her, at least enough
not to want to take that kind of risk.
<p>So she worked her way along the beach, keeping out of sight as best
she could.
<p>Her goal was pretty close and she was looking forward to a very good
meal when she heard the shouting.&nbsp; She ducked down, caught in the
open, and looked around, wondering if anyone had spotted her.&nbsp; The
beach was very wide here, with a considerable distance between the cliff
face and the current water level.&nbsp; From the tide line, Nina saw that
most of this space would be underwater at high tide.
<p>The screaming seemed to come from the ocean side, and Nina understood
the distorted words.&nbsp; "DADDY!&nbsp; DADDY!" they called out, and Nina
realized it was a girl yelling.&nbsp; Nina saw a shadow running from the
water, and saw in horror that she was right in the path of the runner.&nbsp;
Had she not hesitated, things may have turned out a lot differently, but
Nina couldn't move until it was too late, and too late for her was when
the girl was close enough to see her.
<p>The girl, she must have been eight or nine, stopped, wide-eyed at seeing
Nina crouched naked in the sand.&nbsp; But Nina found out that the girl
barely noticed her nudity.
<p>"Please, help him!" cried the girl.&nbsp; "My brother, he's out in the
water.&nbsp; He's in trouble.&nbsp; Daddy told us not to swim in the dark,
but he did it anyway and he's in trouble!&nbsp; Can you help us?"
<p>"Your brother is out there?" Nina said, looking out at the water.
<p>"Yeah, he's in trouble.&nbsp; Can you help?&nbsp; PLEASE?"
<p>"Where is he, I can't see him!" Nina said, standing up and crossing
an arm across her breasts.
<p>"Please, he's out there.&nbsp; Help him!"
<p>Nina looked at the girl and then at the water.&nbsp; She felt her nudity,
but also felt the fear of the girl, so she began to jog to the water's
edge, looking out for any sign of the boy.
<p>She heard him rather than saw him, a faint, "Daddy!&nbsp; Mommy!"
<p>Nina waded into the water and started to swim.&nbsp; She knew what she
was doing was very dangerous, going out into the ocean in the dark without
any clear plan.&nbsp; But she felt she had to do something.&nbsp; As usual
though, once she was swimming, Nina felt her confidence grow, and soon
she was eating up the distance to where she thought the boy was.&nbsp;
Every twenty strokes, Nina would stop and take a bearing on the boy's cries,
hoping he didn't lose his strength before she got to him.&nbsp; He couldn't
be far, but it seemed to take forever.
<p>Farther, out, as she was treading water, a swell rose, and she saw him
just yards away.&nbsp; She swam over to him and grabbed him from behind.&nbsp;
He immediately began to struggle, but she held on to him.
<p>"It's okay, it's okay," she said, "I'm here to help you!"
<p>"DADDY!" the boy yelled.
<p>"We'll get you back to your Dad, just hang on, okay"
<p>The boy nodded, crying but calmer.&nbsp; Nina figured he was older than
his sister, maybe twelve or thirteen.&nbsp; It was hard to tell in the
water.
<p>"Cramp," said the boy, "left leg...bad."
<p>"It's okay, I'll swim for us both.&nbsp; You just lay back and float,
okay?"
<p>The boy did as he was told and Nina began to tow him to shore.&nbsp;
She was glad she swam every day, working out the exact muscle groups she
was using now, for it was hard work.&nbsp; Not only was she pulling a dead
weight, but she felt she was also swimming against the current.&nbsp; She
didn't give up though, she kept moving.
<p>"ALEX!" yelled a voice from the shore and Nina winced.&nbsp; She knew
there was no way she could avoid being seen nude by another person unless
she abandoned the boy close to shore, and that she wasn't about to do.
<p>"HERE, DAD!" yelled the boy.&nbsp; "I'M BEING RESCUED!"
<p>Nina almost laughed.&nbsp; She kept going though, until her toes scraped
sand and she was able to stand.&nbsp; She helped the boy to get on his
feet, and she was vaguely aware of a man running through the shallows toward
them.
<p>The man, dressed in slacks and a shirt, ran right to the boy and picked
him up.&nbsp; He was followed closely by the girl, and a woman who presumably
was the mother.
<p>All of them crowded around the boy while Nina edged away.&nbsp; Maybe
they wouldn't notice she was nude!
<p>No such luck.&nbsp; The light was dim here at the ocean's edge, but
not so dim she couldn't be seen.&nbsp; When the man turned to focus on
her, his jaw dropped before he caught himself.&nbsp; His wife also noticed
Nina's lack of dress and looked stunned for a second, before an amused
smile crossed her features.&nbsp; Then she turned back to the children.
<p>The man took a step forward, still knee deep in water.&nbsp; "Er...thank
you...for rescuing Alex," he said.
<p>"It's okay, I was glad to help!" Nina said, feeling VERY self-conscious.
<p>The man stared at her for a second, before speaking again.&nbsp; "No...I
mean it.&nbsp; You saved his life, there must be something I could do for
you...maybe, some clothes?"
<p>"Don't be silly, Donny!" said his wife from behind him.&nbsp; "It's
obvious the girl was just out skinny dipping, she doesn't need any clothes.&nbsp;
She must be from the Laja place up the beach, they hardly ever get dressed
at all anymore!"
<p>Nina blushed big time.
<p>"Well," said Donny, "I have to do something for you."&nbsp; He stepped
forward, and his stunned expression changed to one of recognition.
<p>Nina's heart fell because at that same time she recognized him.&nbsp;
Donald Bell, one of the lawyers at the firm she worked at.
<p>"Wait a minute," he said, "You're...Nina West, right?"
<p>Nina smiled a hopeless smile.&nbsp; "Yeah...Hi, Mr. Bell."
<p>"Honey, this is Nina West, a paralegal from the firm!" he told his wife.
<p>The woman looked a little startled, but offered a smile.&nbsp; "Very
glad to meet you, Nina, I'm Wanda.&nbsp; Thank you for being here for my
son."&nbsp; She turned to Donny.&nbsp; "I'm taking the kids back to the
house; Dad'll be here any minute and I want to check Alex out."
<p>"I'm okay, Mom," said the boy, now conscious of the fact that he had
been saved from drowning by a beautiful naked woman.&nbsp; Boy, would he
have a story to tell his friends!
<p>His mother said she would check anyway and pulled him and his sister
back in the direction of the house.
<p>Donny looked back at Nina.&nbsp; "I really want to do something for
you.&nbsp; Why don't you collect your clothes and come up to the house
with us, so we can talk about this."
<p>"I can't," Nina said, wishing she could die right there.
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"I...left them...way up the beach.&nbsp; I was...taking a walk."
<p>Donny swallowed.&nbsp; "Oh...well, come up anyway.&nbsp; I'm sure Wanda
won't mind.&nbsp; It's not like WE haven't skinny dipped in the ocean from
time to time."
<p>"No, please.&nbsp; I can't.&nbsp; I have to meet someone," Nina said,
just wanting to get away.
<p>"Well, go get them and bring them back if that will make you feel any
better."
<p>"Please, maybe another time?" Nina pleaded.
<p>Donny nodded.&nbsp; "Okay, another time.&nbsp; But I want to make this
right with you!"
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "There's no need, your son is safe.&nbsp; I have
to go."
<p>Donny nodded and watched Nina depart until the darkness swallowed her
up.&nbsp; He had watched her many times at the firm, and water cooler talk
had her pegged as one of the more desirable single women in the firm.&nbsp;
He had never in his wildest dreams ever imagined that he would get to see
her without a stitch of clothing on.&nbsp; What a tale to tell HIS friends.
<p>Nina, shaking from the adrenaline rush from both the rescue and the
discovery of her identity, made it without further incident to the cell
tower, and at the top collapsed into Jim's arms.
<p>It took him a little bit to get the story out of her, but by then she
was a lot more composed.
<p>"Come on, then," he said.&nbsp; "I'll take you home and we can eat there.&nbsp;
I think you've had enough adventure for one night."
<p>Nina looked up at him and kissed him.&nbsp; "Thank you."
<br>&nbsp;

<p><br>
<p>Part 21, A Night Out.
<p>While Nina and Jim were still out, Helen, Kelly, and Brian Cook ate
dinner together in the small dining room next to the kitchen.&nbsp; Mrs.
Terry was elsewhere; she never ate with the rest, not thinking it proper.
<p>Kelly was her usual exuberant self, talking with her grandfather about
a Warhol exhibit she had seen while at school.&nbsp; The old man was almost
as animated as his granddaughter as they talked about art, and Helen was
surprised that Kelly was so fluent on the subject.
<p>Helen herself could barely follow the conversation, so she just smiled
and nodded as the remarks flowed across the table.
<p>Helen was feeling a lot better than she had been that morning, for a
couple of reasons.&nbsp; First, she was dressed again; a pair of soft well-worn
jeans, a T-shirt, and of course, a full set of underwear.&nbsp; Second,
she had gotten a letter in the mail from her real landlord, telling her
she could move back into her own apartment in just a few days.
<p>Helen was glad to see the end of her stay coming up, not because she
didn't like living here while her landlord brought her apartment building
up to code, but because of the unusual rent Brian had demanded of her while
she stayed here.&nbsp; Her rent was much like Nina's, except that Helen
only had 24 hours of nudity to pay, whenever and however Brian Cook wanted
them.&nbsp; So far, he had used up only twelve hours of her time, and Helen
hoped that she would get away with not having to pay the entire amount.&nbsp;
But somehow, she doubted that.
<p>A part of her wanted Brian to just get it over with, but another larger
part was scared to death of it and hoped the old man would forget.
<p>She found it strange, when she let herself think about it, that she
was more nervous of being nude here with Brian Cook than she had been when
forced into nudity at her boss's home several weeks ago.&nbsp; She had
no idea why one was so different from the other.
<p>She wondered if it was Kelly, who seemed so comfortable with her own
nudity.&nbsp; Helen watched her as she talked, her lithe young body shifting
and flexing as the girl moved.&nbsp; Kelly was a pretty young woman, Helen
had to admit, but she was no Nina.
<p>'Damn', Helen thought.&nbsp; Nina was always popping into her head,
usually during Helen's unguarded moments.&nbsp; She thought about earlier
that morning in the sunroom upstairs, watching Nina and Jim drive away,
thinking of them together, and how...
<p>Helen pressed her legs together and tried to concentrate on her food.&nbsp;
She happened to look up at that moment and caught Kelly watching her.&nbsp;
The two women locked eyes for a moment before Helen broke contact.&nbsp;
She didn't see Kelly smile.
<p>Helen had always been nervous around Kelly, but ever since this morning
when Kelly caught her...
<p>Helen played with her food.
<p>"Well I have some work to do upstairs," Brian said, pushing himself
away from the table.&nbsp; "You girls have a good evening, it was a pleasure
dining with you both!"&nbsp; He smiled, and both Helen and Kelly bid him
a good night, knowing that he would be in his studio until he chose to
go to bed.
<p>Once he left, the air was filled with silence as Helen toyed with her
food and Kelly stared at her.
<p>Kelly had been wondering what to do with Helen all day.&nbsp; She was
bored, and her discovery of Helen obviously playing with herself in the
sunroom that morning had placed Kelly in a position of power.&nbsp; Helen
obviously didn't want to be reminded of the event; it was a weakness Kelly
decided to exploit for some fun.
<p>"I was thinking of heading down to a club tonight," Kelly said aloud.
<p>Helen glanced up for a second, wondering what club would be likely to
let her in, since Kelly refused to wear clothes.
<p>"I want you to come with me," Kelly said sweetly.
<p>"Er...no...thanks.&nbsp; I think I'll just stay in tonight," Helen said,
not wanting to spend any time with Kelly that she didn't have to.
<p>Kelly leaned forward, her small breasts brushing the tabletop.&nbsp;
"Oh, I think you'll come with me tonight, you could use a night out."
<p>"No.&nbsp; I'm not going anywhere," Helen replied.
<p>"We both know you will," said Kelly, leaning closer.&nbsp; She was looking
Helen in the eye, and Helen saw she wasn't smiling, something rare for
Kelly.&nbsp; It made her really nervous.
<p>"You can't make me," Helen said softly.
<p>"Can't I?&nbsp; Well I expect not," said Kelly leaning back in her chair.&nbsp;
"But I don't want to go out alone tonight."
<p>Helen sighed with relief.
<p>"I suppose," Kelly continued, "we could stay in and wait for Nina to
come home, wouldn't that be fun?&nbsp; You and me, waiting for the beautiful
Nina, side-by-side, thinking about her.&nbsp; You DO like thinking about
her, don't you?"
<p>Helen didn't move.
<p>"Oh, I think you do, you think about her a lot, you go upstairs and
think about her where you think it's private, where you think it's private
enough to act on your thoughts, where you can take your fingers and___,"
<p>"SHUT UP!" Helen yelled.
<p>Kelly smiled; it was not a pleasant smile.&nbsp; "Perhaps I should tell
Nina what I saw," she said.
<p>"You didn't see anything!" Helen replied, scared that Kelly did.
<p>Kelly chuckled.&nbsp; "You can't be sure that I didn't...can you?"
<p>"There was nothing to see!" Helen insisted.
<p>Kelly leaned back further, raising her arms and stretching her nude
body.&nbsp; She began to rub her breasts, gently, a finger circling a nipple.&nbsp;
"Nothing?&nbsp; The funny thing is that, being nude, you are so aware of
your body and its needs and wants.&nbsp; And BEING nude it is SO much easier
to submit to its needs and give it what it wants."&nbsp; Kelly stopped
the motion of her hands and looked at Helen.&nbsp; "Don't you agree?"
<p>Helen sat trembling, wondering if Kelly DID see.
<p>"What would Nina do if I told her, how do you think she would react?"
<p>"It's a lie, I'll tell her you were lying!"
<p>Kelly tilted her head to one side.&nbsp; "You could, and she might even
believe you.&nbsp; But don't you think that, way in the back of her head
that, she might wonder?&nbsp; You spend a lot of time around her when she
is nude, she might not feel that comfortable with you around her like that
anymore.&nbsp; What WOULD suspicion like that do to your friendship?"
<p>"You wouldn't do it," Helen whispered.
<p>Kelly leaned forward again.&nbsp; "Do you want to risk it?"
<p>Helen stared at Kelly for a minute before finally shaking her head.&nbsp;
"Okay, I'll go with you to your club."
<p>Kelly grinned.&nbsp; "Fantastic!&nbsp; But let's get you changed into
something more suitable for club hopping!"
<p>"I'm NOT going naked!" Helen said firmly.
<p>"Of course not!&nbsp; Why would I want you to?&nbsp; I just want the
company, that's all.&nbsp; Come on, I'm sure you have a party dress up
there somewhere!"
<p>They went together up to Helen's room, and Kelly immediately started
going through Helen's closet.&nbsp; Unlike Nina, who had all her clothes
locked in the gatehouse apartment, Helen had been allowed to keep hers
with her.
<p>"Strip!" Kelly ordered.&nbsp; "Let's find you something fun to wear!"
<p>Helen scowled.&nbsp; "I can dress myself, thank you very much!"
<p>"I'm sure you can!" Kelly said, winking over her shoulder before turning
back to the closet.
<p>Helen stood fuming for a moment before reaching for the hem of her shirt.&nbsp;
She pulled it off, and after a moment's hesitation, undid the clasp on
her jeans and pulled them off too.&nbsp; Now she stood in bra and panties.
<p>Kelly turned and winced.&nbsp; "Those won't do...here!"&nbsp; Kelly
reached into a drawer and tossed Helen a sexy red bra and panty set Helen
saved for special occasions.
<p>"I don't need to change my underwear; who's going to see?"
<p>"It's not who sees, Helen, but what you know!&nbsp; I'm sure you'll
feel a lot more inclined to have some fun in your bikini set than in those
big white Kmart specials!"
<p>Helen picked up the underwear and frowned.&nbsp; "I don't think so,"
she said.
<p>Kelly turned, an outfit in her hand.&nbsp; It was a black denim skirt
and a red silk blouse.&nbsp; "Do you have stockings to match these?" she
asked.
<p>"Yes," Helen replied before she could stop herself.
<p>"Well, get out of that awful underwear and go find them.&nbsp; Then
hurry up and get dressed before Nina comes home.&nbsp; I have SO much I'd
like to tell her."&nbsp; Kelly smiled.
<p>Helen paled a little, but she obeyed.&nbsp; She undid her bra and put
it on the bed, then pulled off her panties.&nbsp; Naked, she headed for
the chest of drawers and searched through it for some stockings.&nbsp;
Helen wasn't as athletically built as Nina was, and her tanned skin showed
the kind of swimsuit she usually wore, but her curves were very pleasing
to the eye.&nbsp; Softer than Nina, more delicate and feminine, Helen was
quite a beauty in her own right.
<p>All this Kelly took in as Helen started to dress.
<p>When done, Helen found some heels, and Kelly was satisfied.
<p>"You look good, you don't even need to touch up your makeup!"
<p>Helen nodded slightly, the praise unexpected.&nbsp; "Thanks."
<p>Kelly smiled.&nbsp; "Come on, we'll take my car, you drive!"
<p>---***---
<p>Helen didn't expect to drive downtown, given that Kelly was still nude,
but that was where Kelly directed her, and soon the little Geo was parked
in the crowded lot of a bar a block off Main Street.&nbsp; Getting out,
Helen was nervous.&nbsp; Not for herself, for at least she had clothes
on, but for Kelly, who got out of the car with no hesitation or embarrassment
whatsoever.
<p>"You're going in like that?" Helen asked the younger woman.
<p>"Sure!&nbsp; Would I have brought you down here if I wasn't?" grinned
Kelly.
<p>"But...won't you get arrested?&nbsp; Or even worse, what if you get
into trouble with one of the guys in there?"
<p>Kelly moved next to Helen and patted her shoulder.&nbsp; "I'm touched
by your concern, but I don't think that will be a problem."&nbsp; Kelly
continued to grin as she walked over to the entrance of the club, and shaking
her head, Helen followed.&nbsp; Helen figured HER role tonight was to protect
Kelly while she was in the bar flaunting her nudity in front of everyone.&nbsp;
Helen had no idea how she was supposed to do this, and only hoped she could
keep Kelly safe until the cops showed up.
<p>Inside, the bar was loud and busy, and Helen squinted through the smoke
in an effort to track down Kelly.&nbsp; She saw the naked girl talking
to a big man who Helen assumed was the bouncer.&nbsp; She fully expected
the bouncer to show Kelly the door, but instead the two of them were chatting
like old friends.
<p>Helen opened her eyes in surprise and looked around to see who else
had noticed that Kelly was nude.&nbsp; Several had, but no one seemed too
put out by it, although eyes were drawn to her.
<p>"She's with me!" Kelly said to the bouncer as she slipped past.&nbsp;
"Come on, Helen, let's get a drink!"
<p>Helen followed, a little stunned as Kelly wove her way through the bar
and across the dance floor, totally unconcerned that she was nude and everyone
else was not.&nbsp; What surprised Helen even more was the reaction of
the bar patrons.&nbsp; Some WERE surprised to see a naked girl walking
among them, and stared at her.&nbsp; Others gave her a glance and kept
on with what they were doing.&nbsp; A few smiled at her and greeted her
by name, which Kelly enthusiastically returned.&nbsp; Several even came
up and gave her a hug!
<p>It was then that Helen noticed something about the customers.&nbsp;
Almost all were women, with very few men in attendance.&nbsp; Women sat
together at the tables, danced together, and several couples were...
<p>Helen immediately began to blush, realizing where she was.&nbsp; No
wonder Kelly was unafraid of any guy taking advantage of her lack of clothing;
men generally didn't come to a place like this.&nbsp; Once she stopped
looking out for Kelly, Helen noticed many of the looks that were directed
at HER.&nbsp; Either curious and/or friendly, Helen tried to return their
smiles with one of her own, while wondering why she didn't run back outside.&nbsp;
'Yes,' she thought, 'I COULD use a drink.'
<p>Kelly eventually stopped at a table where four other well-dressed women
sat talking.&nbsp; They all greeted her by name and seemed pleased to see
her.&nbsp; Then Kelly introduced Helen, and all eyes were on her.
<p>"Why Kelly, she's lovely!" said one of them, a blonde named Ryann.&nbsp;
"I'm happy to meet you, Helen."
<p>Helen smiled and murmured a greeting, and in turn got introduced to
them all.
<p>Two more chairs were brought up, drinks ordered, and Helen settled down,
wondering why Kelly had brought her here.&nbsp; She obviously didn't need
the protection of someone she hardly knew.&nbsp; She knew these women a
lot better than she knew Helen.
<p>But as time went on, Helen lost her apprehension and got more comfortable.&nbsp;
For a start, these women were not what she expected.&nbsp; While it was
true she was on the receiving end of a few appraising looks, on the whole
Helen felt less intimidated sexually by THIS group than a similar group
of men.&nbsp; Also, no one present flaunted their apparent sexuality, although
looking around, Helen could always spot at least one or more couples touching
or interacting the way lovers do in public places.&nbsp; For the most part
these women acted...well like any group of friends who were just out for
a fun night at a club.&nbsp; There was some joking around with Kelly about
her nudity, and how daring she was to come here like that, but that was
all really.
<p>Helen got her drinks, and as the evening went on, got more and more
involved in the conversation around her, and she could have admitted to
having a good time.
<p>Then, a shadow fell over the evening.
<p>A tall brunette with excellent taste in clothes walked up to the table
and smiled down at all of them.
<p>The group grew silent; even Kelly, and Helen looked up to see why.
<p>"Hi, Katie," Kelly said.
<p>"Kelly," said the brunette, who looked to be in her early thirties,
"it's so good to SEE you again."
<p>Helen saw Kelly shift a little, and Helen was a little shocked.&nbsp;
Was Kelly actually uncomfortable?&nbsp; Helen was a little drunk, she had
to admit, but she had never seen Kelly act like that in front of anyone.&nbsp;
She actually seemed conscious of her nudity for the first time!
<p>Katie said hello to each of the other women in turn, and obviously they
all knew her, for they all reacted as Kelly had.&nbsp; Then Katie turned
to Helen.&nbsp; She smiled and extended a hand.&nbsp; "I don't believe
I've had the pleasure."
<p>"Hi, I'm Helen," Helen said, taking the hand but not knowing what to
do with it.
<p>"Helen, such an old fashioned name.&nbsp; One of my favorites."&nbsp;
Katie gave her hand a squeeze before letting go and pulling up another
chair.&nbsp; She sat between Kelly and Helen and smiled at the group.
<p>Helen could see why the women at the table were nervous; it was as if
a serpent had just sat down with a bunch of rabbits.&nbsp; Katie just oozed
predator, and Helen wondered who her prey was going to be that night.&nbsp;
Helen had met a few guys whose self-confidence was so great that they exuded
the same sort of aura, but never a woman.&nbsp; But then she thought about
her boss, Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; Helen chuckled into her drink, thinking
about a clash between those two titans.
<p>The bubbles in her glass caught Katie's attention.
<p>"So tell me, Helen," she said, her voice low and smooth yet very firm,
"how did you find this little group?"
<p>Helen glanced at Kelly and swore the girl looked like she'd rather Helen
didn't answer.&nbsp; But she answered anyway, her internal censor a little
delayed by the alcohol in her system.
<p>Katie raised her eyebrows and looked over at Kelly.&nbsp; "Is this the
girl your grandfather has staying with you?"
<p>"No...no.&nbsp; That's Nina," Kelly said.&nbsp; "Helen just works with
her."
<p>Katie's eyes narrowed for a moment before the smile returned to them.&nbsp;
"Pity, I would like to meet her sometime.&nbsp; She does lead an interesting
home life."&nbsp; She turned to Helen.&nbsp; "You DO know about...Nina's...home
life don't you?"
<p>Before Helen could answer, Kelly butted in.&nbsp; "Sure she does.&nbsp;
In fact, Helen is staying with us for a week, and Granddad has an arrangement
with her too!"
<p>Helen blushed and looked at her drink.
<p>"Does she now?"&nbsp; Katie turned her full attention on Helen, and
Kelly seemed to relax a little.
<p>Helen found herself staring into a pair of emerald green eyes.
<p>"You'll have to tell us all about it!"
<p>Helen swallowed.&nbsp; "There's nothing to tell, really," she said.
<p>"Nonsense.&nbsp; I'm sure you have stories we would love to hear about."
<p>One of the other women said she didn't understand, so Katie explained
that Helen and Nina had a rather unusual form of rent payment.&nbsp; Helen
thought her fairly well informed for someone she had never met before this
evening, and blushed strongly when the other women at the table realized
that for some of her time Helen was required to be nude.&nbsp; Certainly
there were a few grins.
<p>Katie leveled her gaze at Helen, and demanded to know more.
<p>Unable to stop herself, Helen began to talk.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was several hours later, and Helen knew she'd had too much to drink
again.&nbsp; She was very aware of what was going on around her, but felt
almost powerless to stop any of it.
<p>Her skirt and heels were gone, lost somewhere on the dance floor as
she spent time with Katie, so she sat at the table in just her underthings
and silk blouse.&nbsp; Most of the original members of the group were still
there, but there was a significant change in the group aura since Katie
had arrived.&nbsp; Talk still flowed, but subjects didn't last very long
and conversation seemed strained.&nbsp; Also, the women seemed to avoid
looking at Helen, especially when Katie was close by.&nbsp; Even Kelly
seemed subdued, or was it scared?&nbsp; Whatever it was, Helen got the
impression that she was relieved not to be the center of Katie's attention
at the moment.
<p>But Helen was.&nbsp; Katie sat close, and was continually touching Helen
as they talked.&nbsp; A brush here, a nudge there.&nbsp; Helen found it
difficult to resist the woman's advances, if that's what they were.&nbsp;
Helen was rather confused.
<p>She looked down to see that all the buttons of her blouse had come undone,
revealing her lacy red bra.
<p>"That's lovely," Katie said, parting the sides of the blouse a little
more, "where did you get it?"
<p>Helen looked up at Kelly, who glanced away, and automatically began
talking about a trip to L.A.&nbsp; she managed to put together a few months
back.&nbsp; Katie listened attentively but continued to examine Helen's
bra, pulling on her blouse until it fell off her soft shoulders.
<p>"There," said Katie, "now we can see it better."
<p>Helen knew she was being undressed in the middle of a public bar, a
bar filled with women with more than a casual interest in another woman's
body, yet she felt helpless, not in control.&nbsp; She felt that if she
maybe had another drink, the helpless feeling would go away.
<p>Katie started talking about how good the lace looked on Helen, and how
well the bra complimented her figure.&nbsp; She got the others involved
in talking about Helen's body in general, and Helen blushed.
<p>Then suddenly Katie stood up.&nbsp; "Come, Helen, let's dance again."
<p>Helen nodded and began to rise while her mind yelled that all she was
wearing was her bra and panties.&nbsp; A part of her got the message and
she stopped.&nbsp; "I can't," she said, nervously looking around at all
the women staring at her.
<p>Katie took hold of her shoulders.&nbsp; "Sure you can, Hon', it's okay.&nbsp;
You're among friends.&nbsp; I'm your friend, aren't I?"
<p>Helen nodded slowly, still aware of the crowd of people around her seeing
her in her underwear.&nbsp; "But...I'm not dressed."
<p>Katie smiled.&nbsp; "What does that matter, Honey?&nbsp; We're all women
here!&nbsp; Besides, Kelly has less on than you do, and it doesn't bother
her, does it?"
<p>Helen looked unsteadily at Kelly who refused to look back.
<p>Katie began to massage Helen's shoulders.&nbsp; "You probably show off
less when you wear a swim suit anyway, and you look good like this, you
deserve to show off!"
<p>"Deserve to..." Helen whispered.
<p>Katie smiled and led the nearly nude women out onto the dance floor.&nbsp;
Many of the women in the room knew Katie, and they gave her and Helen a
wide berth.&nbsp; Many eyes were on the couple.
<p>Helen did her best to follow along with the end of the fast song that
was playing, but it wasn't until a slow song started that she lost even
more control.&nbsp; Katie held her close, arms wrapped around Helen, and
the couple rocked back and forth for a while.&nbsp; All the time Katie
whispered in Helen's ear, telling her how lovely she was, and how she and
Katie could become such good friends.
<p>Helen danced in a haze, and was only slightly aware of how her bra began
to slip down between her and Katie, and how Katie's hands slowly slide
down to Helen's hips.
<p>At the table, Kelly looked at her drink.&nbsp; Bringing Helen here was
supposed to have been a bit of fun.&nbsp; A sort of poke in Helen's side
about Helen's obvious attraction to Nina.&nbsp; Kelly had meant for nothing
more to happen than for Helen to get a little insight on her feelings while
being confronted with the lack of reality in the lesbian stereotype she
had obviously been sandbagged with.&nbsp; But Katie being here had ruined
all of that.&nbsp; Kelly had lost control and didn't know how to get it
back, not from Katie.&nbsp; Katie was something else indeed, a mistress
of manipulation, the queen of humiliation.&nbsp; There wasn't a person
who hadn't been stung, and stung bad by Katie, and none of them wanted
to risk it again.
<p>Yet, as Kelly watched Katie slip Helen's panties to the floor, Kelly
knew that Helen wouldn't stand a chance.&nbsp; Helen never struck Kelly
as someone who could really stand up for herself.&nbsp; She was a follower,
not a leader.
<p>The crowd was beginning to thin out now, so it was easier to see Katie
and Helen on the dance floor.&nbsp; Helen stood swaying with the music,
her eyes closed, her hands loosely around her partner, while Katie let
her hands travel lightly up and down Helen's body, enjoying the silky feel
of her skin.
<p>Kelly glanced at the bar to see the bartenders watching the couple closely,
wishing that they at least would stop what was going on.&nbsp; But this
club was fairly liberal, given their clientele, and didn't intervene unless
some actual sex was being committed.&nbsp; Kelly also wondered about the
rumors that Katie had shares in the place, and if THAT stopped the employees
from doing anything.
<p>Kelly closed her eyes and mentally kicked herself for bringing Helen
here.&nbsp; She thought about Nina, who she genuinely liked, and how she
would react when she found out about this.&nbsp; Kelly made a decision.
<p>Kelly stood up and walked out onto the dance floor, approaching the
couple, who didn't notice her until she spoke.&nbsp; "Come on, Helen, it's
time to go."
<p>Katie looked at Kelly sharply while Helen looked up with a glazed look
in her eyes.&nbsp; "What do you mean...go!" Katie said.
<p>Kelly didn't look at her.&nbsp; Instead, she bent low to pick up Helen's
panties and she looked around for the discarded bra.
<p>"It's time to go.&nbsp; Why don't you help me get Helen dressed, and
I'll take her home.&nbsp; She's not in any condition to be out anymore."
<p>Katie stood back, and for a second Helen couldn't find her balance.&nbsp;
But she did, and after a second realized she was naked and tried to cover
herself.&nbsp; Katie moved between Helen and Kelly.&nbsp; "Go back to your
table, little girl," she said slowly.
<p>Kelly looked up.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; I'm not going to, Katie.&nbsp; I'm
going to take Helen home.&nbsp; If you like, I'll come back and...we...can
spend some time together."
<p>Katie snorted.&nbsp; "I already HAVE my partner for the night, Kelly,
I don't need you."
<p>"No.&nbsp; Not Helen, she isn't your type.&nbsp; Let me take her home."&nbsp;
Kelly moved to take Helen's hand, thinking she would drag the woman out
to the car naked if she had to, but Katie blocked her way.
<p>Katie reached up and twisted both Kelly's nipples at the same time,
making the nude girl jump back in surprise.&nbsp; "Who do you think you
are, talking to me like that?" Katie said.
<p>"Someone who isn't going to take any of your shit anymore," replied
Kelly.
<p>Katie's expression darkened.&nbsp; "You don't know whom you're dealing
with," she said.
<p>Kelly felt her confidence build and wondered why she hadn't confronted
this woman before.&nbsp; "I don't care anymore.&nbsp; Why don't you go
tease one of your other friends?&nbsp; Helen and I are out of here!"&nbsp;
Kelly made to move toward Helen, who stood watching all this with a shocked
look on her face, but was suddenly gripped from behind by two large hands.&nbsp;
She was held immobile by the upper arms and she looked behind her to see
the bouncer.&nbsp; "Carl, come on, let me go!"
<p>Carl just smiled at her and looked to Katie for his orders.
<p>Katie smiled a serpent's smile.&nbsp; "You know you've destroyed my
mood.&nbsp; I was planning on having a good time with Helen.&nbsp; But
now I think I'll have a good time of another sort.&nbsp; You want to go
home?&nbsp; Sure, I'll send you on your way!"&nbsp; Katie's smile got broader
and Kelly knew she was in trouble.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The ground was soft and prickly under her bare feet, and the smell of
wet vegetation was very strong.&nbsp; It had obviously just rained, and
from the sound of the thunder nearby, it could still rain again.&nbsp;
Helen held one hand across her chest, the other pulled away from her by
the big man that had manhandled her out of the car.&nbsp; She assumed it
was a man; she was blindfolded so she couldn't see.&nbsp; Being blindfolded
in a moving car while being as drunk as she was had been no picnic for
Helen, and she was glad the ride was over, although she had no idea where
she was except that she was outdoors someplace and naked.
<p>She heard a set of clicks and something cold and metallic wrapped itself
around her wrist.&nbsp; More clicks and the handcuffs were connected to
something.&nbsp; Her blindfold was ripped off, and in the darkness Helen
saw that she and Kelly were handcuffed together.&nbsp; Looking about, Helen
saw they were in the woods somewhere and that their only company was Katie
and Carl the bouncer, who was heading back to a car parked a little way
away.
<p>Katie smiled at the both of them.&nbsp; "I'm sure you can both make
it home from here, so I'll just drop you off!"
<p>"Dammit, Katie," Kelly said, "Where are we?"
<p>Katie ignored her, instead walking up to Helen.&nbsp; "I'm going to
miss our time together," she whispered into Helen's ear.&nbsp; "Perhaps
another time, we can resume?"&nbsp; Katie planted a hard kiss on Helen's
lips, her fingers finding Helen's soft spot and penetrating roughly, before
breaking away and smiling once more.&nbsp; She started back for the car.
<p>"Please!" Helen said, finding her voice.&nbsp; "Please don't leave us!"
<p>Katie laughed.
<p>"Please?" Helen whispered.
<p>Both nude women watched in silence as the car drove away.
<p>"Now what?" Helen said, sobering up some with the realization that she
was naked and lost miles from home.
<p>"Now we walk, what else can we do," said Kelly taking a step.&nbsp;
She was brought up short by Helen, who didn't move.
<p>"Why?&nbsp; Why did you do it?&nbsp; What have I ever done to you?&nbsp;
Why did you introduce me to that bitch?"
<p>"I didn't mean to; I didn't know she'd be there!"
<p>Helen didn't believe her.&nbsp; "You knew she would do something like
this, didn't you?&nbsp; You KNEW!&nbsp; I could see how scared you were
of her.&nbsp; WHY DID YOU POINT HER AT ME?"
<p>"I didn't...I___,"
<p>Helen, fueled by the sudden anger that alcohol promotes, swung with
her free hand at her companion.&nbsp; But she was too slow in her drunk
and Kelly was able to dodge.&nbsp; Still, the punch had momentum and Helen
lost her footing, slipping on the muddy ground and pulling Kelly down with
her.&nbsp; The two women began fighting where they lay; or rather, Helen
kept trying to hit Kelly, who tried to hold Helen down in self-defense.
<p>The two nude women rolled around on the ground for a minute before Helen
stopped.&nbsp; Helen started to cry and Kelly felt terrible.&nbsp; She
stopped trying to hold Helen down and just held her, offering what little
comfort she could.&nbsp; The couple lay there for a little bit, before
the rain started again and forced them to get up.&nbsp; Covered in dirt
and little twigs, both women looked a sight.
<p>"I'm sorry, Helen, really I am.&nbsp; It wasn't meant to be like this."
<p>Helen giggled, "It's okay.&nbsp; I'm sorry too.&nbsp; If I hadn't had
drunk so much tonight, she probably wouldn't have gotten me naked in the
middle of a bar!"
<p>Kelly nodded, although in her head she figured that Katie still would
have managed it.&nbsp; She was awfully good at getting other women out
of their clothes.
<p>"So," Helen said, looking about again, "how do we get home?"
<p>Kelly sighed.&nbsp; "We walk."
<p>"But which way?"
<p>Kelly didn't know and said as much.&nbsp; Both women had been blindfolded
before leaving the club.&nbsp; They had been driven around for quite a
while before being dropped off.&nbsp; They could be anywhere.&nbsp; "Maybe
we could find a place where there is a phone.&nbsp; Call for someone to
come pick us up!"
<p>Helen was horrified.&nbsp; "But that would mean us being seen by someone!"
<p>Kelly lifted their cuffed hands.&nbsp; "I don't think we can get out
of that, Helen, I doubt we could make it back without help.&nbsp; Besides,
so what if they see us!"
<p>"I'm not...well, I can't be so...casual about my body as you," Helen
said.
<p>"Why not?" Kelly asked, pulling Helen along the track the car had driven
down.&nbsp; It was raining a little harder and Kelly wanted to get moving.
<p>"It's just..." Helen said, trying to explain modesty to someone who
obviously didn't have any.
<p>"It's just nothing.&nbsp; This is my body, so what?&nbsp; People who
look at me have most probably seen nude women before, so I'm not showing
them anything new, and all a body is, is a container for my mind, which
they DON'T get to see, so what do I care!&nbsp; Why should I be uncomfortable
just to suit everybody else!"
<p>Helen was a little stunned by the outburst and couldn't think of anything
to say in reply.
<p>The two cuffed girls eventually found a road.&nbsp; It snaked through
some heavily wooded land and there was no indication of what highway it
was or where it led.&nbsp; They were lost, and because of the cloud filled
sky, they couldn't even tell what direction was what.
<p>"Pick a direction," Kelly said.
<p>Helen looked from one way to the other, they both looked the same.&nbsp;
She pointed to her left.
<p>The women began to walk, splashing along the middle of the highway,
their hair matted down by the rain, soaked to the...well, skin.&nbsp; Both
were miserable, both wanted to be home and dry.
<p>After a little bit they saw a light in the trees beyond where the road
curved ahead.&nbsp; The light was moving, and it was obvious it was a car.&nbsp;
Immediately Helen started to panic.&nbsp; "Come on!" she cried, hauling
on Kelly's arm.
<p>"Wait!" Kelly said, but Helen had gotten a good hold of the younger
woman and hauled her into the trees just before the car went by.&nbsp;
Kelly struggled but it was no use, the car went past and all was still
again.
<p>"Why did you do that?" Kelly said.
<p>"You didn't want them to see us, did you?" answered Helen.
<p>"As a matter of fact, I DID.&nbsp; They could have given us a ride,
or at least told us where we were!"
<p>"But..." Helen said
<p>"Face it, Helen.&nbsp; We NEED help, and to be helped, we are going
to be seen!"
<p>Helen shut her mouth, and after a moment, nodded.&nbsp; The couple made
it back to the road and began to walk again.&nbsp; Helen was scared to
death of being seen, but if it was the only way to get home, she was ready
to do it.&nbsp; She walked head down, deep in thought.
<p>The rain kept coming down and both women started to shiver.&nbsp; Despite
the fact that it was a relatively warm rain, it was still cool enough to
slowly bring their body temperatures down, and with nothing available to
cover themselves with, they needed to find shelter.
<p>So preoccupied with their thoughts and the cold were they, that they
didn't notice the lights from the pickup truck behind them until it was
almost upon them.
<p>Helen was almost ready to bolt, but instead stood behind Kelly.&nbsp;
The driver of the truck was surprised to see two nude young women huddled
together in the rain when he pulled up and stopped.
<p>He was a young man, maybe mid twenties, and he grinned as he leaned
out of his window.&nbsp; "You ladies need a ride?"
<p>"Yes, we do, thank you!" Kelly said, and she led Helen around to the
passenger side of the truck.&nbsp; She tried the door but it was locked.
<p>"Sorry!" yelled the driver, who opened it with a grin.&nbsp; He watched
as first Kelly, then Helen climbed in and shut the door.&nbsp; Both women
were dripping wet and he couldn't take his eyes off their bodies.
<p>"Thanks," said Kelly, knowing where his eyes were wandering and not
caring.
<p>"What are you girls doing out here naked and...are those handcuffs?"
<p>"Yeah.&nbsp; It's a joke a friend is playing on us.&nbsp; We have to
get home like this," Kelly replied, thinking of all the times JIM had done
similar things to her, only a lot safer.
<p>The driver looked at them wide eyed.&nbsp; "Some friend!&nbsp; What
would they do if they were mad at ya?&nbsp; Where are you going anyway?"
<p>Kelly told him and the guy whistled.&nbsp; "Gee, that's fifty miles!&nbsp;
A long way to go, nekid in the rain!"
<p>"Well," said Kelly, smiling, "we were helping on getting a little help,
maybe a ride?"
<p>"A ride, huh!&nbsp; Well, maybe I can help ya with that," he said, wheels
turning in his head.
<p>"We'd appreciate it," Kelly said and Helen nodded, also aware of his
roaming eyes.&nbsp; She tried not to cover herself.&nbsp; Let him look
and he'll help was what she thought.
<p>"Yeah, I know.&nbsp; But how much would you appreciate it?" he said
to them.
<p>Kelly's eyes narrowed.&nbsp; "What are you talking about?"
<p>The guy grinned and his expression left little doubt as to what he expected
in payment.
<p>"No way," Kelly growled.&nbsp; "No sex.&nbsp; We can wait for the next
car!"
<p>"Ain't gonna be one for a while, this is a mighty lonely stretch of
highway at this time of night.&nbsp; And you girls are going to catch a
chill wandering around like that out here."
<p>"We'll manage.&nbsp; Come on, Helen, let's go."
<p>Helen started to open the door.
<p>"Oh come on now," said the guy, "don't go away mad!"
<p>The girls slipped back out into the rain.
<p>"You're making a mistake!" the driver yelled.
<p>Kelly shut the door, and with a shrug, the driver drove off.
<p>"Bastard," Kelly said.
<p>Helen sighed.&nbsp; "Come on, let's go."
<p>"Do you think I should have done it?&nbsp; Had sex with him?" Kelly
asked her.
<p>"No, of course not."
<p>Kelly bit her lip.
<p>They walked for another mile, the rain now getting colder, the shivering
getting worse.&nbsp; With each step, both Helen and Kelly regretted losing
the ride.&nbsp; They each thought they wouldn't have given in on the sex,
but maybe they could have figured out SOMETHING.
<p>Then Helen spotted two red lights on the road ahead, and both women
hurried to see what they were.&nbsp; It turned out to be the pickup truck,
the same one they had escaped from a half hour before.&nbsp; The driver
was sitting back in his seat.&nbsp; He sat up at their approach.&nbsp;
He rolled down his window.
<p>Kelly bit her lip and walked up to him.&nbsp; "How about just a blow
job?"
<p>In the end, it took a little more than a blow job to get him to take
them to town.&nbsp; While Kelly got down on the floorboard between his
legs, he demanded that Helen sit with her knees wide open and play with
herself as he drove.&nbsp; He'd take the blow job as he was driving.
<p>Both girls very reluctantly agreed, and Helen tried to hold back her
tears as she rubbed her pussy for the driver's enjoyment.&nbsp; Every so
often, she would glance down at Kelly's bobbing head and wonder how she
was doing.&nbsp; Helen didn't know what was worse, having this dick's dick
in her mouth or opening up your most private part for him to look at.
<p>Helen felt at an all time low.
<p>The trip seemed to last forever, but soon they were back in the bright
lights of the town and the girls were allowed to stop.&nbsp; Kelly told
the driver to pull over.
<p>"Right here," she said.
<p>"Sure thing," he replied with a grin.
<p>Helen looked confused, this wasn't where they lived.&nbsp; But Kelly
hustled her out of the truck as quickly as she could.
<p>"If you need another ride, I'm available anytime!" the driver called
out.
<p>"Not damn likely!" Kelly said, slamming the door shut.
<p>The driver laughed and drove away, leaving Helen and Kelly standing
in a residential part of town.&nbsp; It was very late, or more accurately,
very early in the morning and there was no one about, but still it was
a risk standing out there naked.
<p>"Why here?" Helen asked.&nbsp; "Why didn't you have him drive us home?"
<p>"Do you want him to know where we live?" Kelly said.
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; She was feeling her drunk again and just
wanted to collapse.
<p>"Come on, it can't be more than half a mile," said Kelly, and the two
of them began to walk again.
<p>Tired, cold, and humiliated by the bargain they had made to save themselves
fifty miles of walking, they made no effort to conceal themselves for this
the final stretch.&nbsp; But they probably should have, for not ten minutes
into their walk, a spotlight hit them from behind, lighting them up like
daylight.
<p>"STOP WHERE YOU ARE!" said a voice over a loudspeaker, and the women
turned to see that a patrol car had pulled up behind them.
<p>"Shit!" Kelly said, and she contemplated running.&nbsp; But Helen was
done, the shock of this discovery turning her numb.&nbsp; She could see
her future ending, her arrest and how it would go on her record, how it
would cause her to lose her job, and any hope of a career as a lawyer.&nbsp;
So despondent was she that she didn't even make a move to cover herself
up.
<p>The patrol car pulled up and stopped about fifteen feet away and the
lights shone directly on Helen and Kelly, lighting them up for the world
to see.&nbsp; A cop pulled himself out of the driver's seat and, hauling
a flashlight of his own, ambled over to the nude women.
<p>Kelly grinned, relief flowing through her; she recognized that walk
even though the lights blinded her.&nbsp; "Hi, Frank," she said.
<p>"That's OFFICER Frank to you, Kelly," said the patrolman.&nbsp; "Damn,
I knew I'd catch you out here sometime.&nbsp; You're in for it now!&nbsp;
You know what I told you the last time I caught you naked out here!"
<p>"Sure thing, Frank.&nbsp; That you were going to take me downtown and
stick me in the drunk tank...the MEN'S drunk tank!"
<p>"Yeah, and I meant it too."&nbsp; He shone his flashlight over Helen's
nude body, taking in her pleasant curves before examining her face.&nbsp;
"Who's this?"
<p>"That's Helen, she's a guest of my grandfather's," Kelly said.
<p>"Don't bullshit me, Kelly."
<p>"No bullshit, she is!&nbsp; Are you going to take her downtown too?"
<p>Frank hesitated.&nbsp; He looked at Helen's face again.&nbsp; "Don't
I know you from someplace?"&nbsp; He didn't recognize her without her clothes
on, but he had seen her just the night before as he chased her away from
the CoRTN Shrine where she had been waiting for Nina.
<p>"I'm not surprised you recognize her face, she IS a model.&nbsp; That's
what she is doing at my grandfather's, modeling for him!" Kelly lied.
<p>Helen caught the lie and tried not to blow it, but she wasn't feeling
well.
<p>Frank pointed his light at the cuffs.&nbsp; "What about those?"
<p>Kelly shrugged.&nbsp; "Just something for fun.&nbsp; Look, Frank, are
you going to keep us out here all night where anyone can see us?"
<p>Officer Frank scowled.&nbsp; He had every intention of carrying out
his threat, or at least appearing to.&nbsp; Kelly had flaunted the law
each time she came to visit, and Frank was sick of it, and of her grandfather
using his influence to get her off.&nbsp; But Helen confused him.&nbsp;
Could he risk putting her away too?&nbsp; He decided not this time.
<p>"Turn around," he ordered, and both women maneuvered to face the other
way.
<p>Using his own key, he undid their cuffs, only to lock Kelly's hands
behind her before using his own cuffs to do the same for Helen.&nbsp; Then,
to Helen's embarrassment and Kelly's amusement, Frank followed procedure
and patted them both down.&nbsp; He knew they weren't carrying anything,
but he wanted them both to know who was in charge, and didn't want to lose
the opportunity for a quick grope.
<p>He bundled both women in the back of his patrol car and drove them both
to the Brian Cook house.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The old man was pissed, Nina could tell.&nbsp; He paced the room in
his dark blue robe and slippers, and she could see he was trying not to
lose his temper.
<p>Nearby stood Mrs. Terry, also in a robe, for Officer Frank was not one
of those privy to HER nudity, and she too looked very upset.
<p>Even Nina herself was in a robe, a spare belonging to Mrs. Terry, for
there had been no time for her to go get her own from the gatehouse.&nbsp;
It had been a while since Nina had been dressed in this house; it felt
strange.
<p>At the other end of the lounge stood Kelly, Helen, and Officer Frank.&nbsp;
Both Kelly and Helen looked terrible.&nbsp; Wet, with streaks of mud, their
nude bodies showed signs of a hard time.&nbsp; They were both still cuffed
as well, and Helen stood ashamed at her nudity while Kelly just had an
angry look in her eye.
<p>Frank had just gotten done telling Brian where he had found them and
what they had told him, which wasn't much.
<p>"Well, I appreciate you bringing them both here, Officer Frank," Brian
Cook said.
<p>"I should have taken them downtown," he replied.&nbsp; "I STILL should."
<p>"I'll take care of them," Brian replied.&nbsp; "Thank you."
<p>"May I ask how, Sir?&nbsp; Every year it's the same thing with Kelly,
and I really believe she needs something more than a good talking to from
her grandfather to stop her!"
<p>"She'll get more than that," Brian said, not happy to be talked down
to by Frank.
<p>"Will she?&nbsp; Somehow, I doubt that.&nbsp; With all due respect,
I think you're soft on that girl, too soft.&nbsp; It's my duty to take
her down to be booked, and that's what I think I'll do, to the both of
them!"
<p>He was about to grab the nude women, when Mrs. Terry stepped forward.&nbsp;
"Wait!"
<p>Frank stopped.&nbsp; "Yes, Mrs. Terry, what is it?"
<p>The housekeeper glanced at Brian for a moment before speaking.&nbsp;
"What if we were to punish them to your satisfaction, right now."
<p>"How would you manage that, Mrs. Terry?"
<p>"Back when Kelly was a little girl and she came to stay here, there
were times when it was necessary to punish her for some of the naughty
things she did."
<p>"Oh God," Kelly whispered, her face going pale.
<p>"And how did you punish her, Mrs. Terry?" said the officer.
<p>Again she glanced at Brian, who nodded.&nbsp; "Well, Mr. Cook usually
left it to me, so I chose a method I knew would make an immediate impression
upon her.&nbsp; I spanked her."
<p>"No," Kelly said.
<p>Officer Frank chuckled.&nbsp; "Yes, I can see that being effective.&nbsp;
It's a pity you stopped."
<p>"Well, after a while they get too big for it to be proper," said the
housekeeper.&nbsp; "But in a way it is also more effective at this age.&nbsp;
Certainly the humiliation of the punishment is a lot greater."
<p>"I don't want to be spanked," Kelly said.
<p>"See?" said Mrs. Terry.
<p>If it hadn't been for the housekeeper's dead serious expression, Nina
would have thought Mrs. Terry was joking.&nbsp; But this was no joke, and
Nina looked over to see how Helen was taking it.&nbsp; Helen looked stunned.
<p>"Alright," Officer Frank said after a moment's thought.&nbsp; "You're
the expert.&nbsp; I'll let you spank them.&nbsp; But it has to be right
here right now, or I take them both downtown."
<p>Mrs. Terry nodded and looked once more at Brian, who gestured toward
one of the chairs.
<p>Mrs. Terry seated herself, covering herself demurely with her robe.&nbsp;
"Miss Kelly?"
<p>"No, Alison, pleeeeese!" Kelly said, shrinking away from her punishment.&nbsp;
All her confidence, her carefree attitude had gone.&nbsp; Officer Frank
had to actually carry her to where Mrs. Terry sat.&nbsp; In moments she
was across Mrs. Terry's lap, her cuffed hands held away from her buttocks.
<p>Without any preamble, Mrs. Terry began spanking.&nbsp; She stroked hard
with her bare hand, developing a pace that left little time between strikes.&nbsp;
Kelly screamed from the first swat and continued to yell as the blows rained
down.&nbsp; Nina counted thirty before Mrs. Terry stopped, and Kelly's
butt was very red.
<p>Brian moved forward and helped his granddaughter off his housekeeper's
lap, while Frank got hold of Helen and brought her forward.
<p>Brian looked up.&nbsp; "I doubt she needs this, Officer Frank.&nbsp;
She was no doubt placed in this situation by Kelly."
<p>Frank shook his head.&nbsp; "Then hopefully this will teach her not
to be so gullible.&nbsp; She gets the same punishment or I take them both
in."
<p>Brian nodded slowly, and Helen didn't resist as she was laid across
Mrs. Terry's lap.&nbsp; Nina saw that the housekeeper didn't want to spank
Helen either, but she had to do so.
<p>With Kelly's ass a visible testament to what a well-spanked butt should
look like, Mrs. Terry couldn't really pull her punches.&nbsp; She had to
rain down on Helen just as hard as she did with Kelly.&nbsp; At first,
Helen didn't make a sound, but as each strike landed, Helen began to cry.&nbsp;
Soon, she couldn't stop, and when done, Brian urged Nina to take charge
of her.
<p>"Take her upstairs and put her to bed," he said.
<p>"What about the handcuffs?" Nina asked, and Frank took them off her.
<p>As Nina led Helen up the stairs, she heard Brian start lecturing Kelly
before they got too far to hear.
<p>"I don't feel well," Helen said.
<p>"It's okay, I'll put you to bed," Nina whispered.
<p>"No, please...I...I can't sleep alone tonight.&nbsp; Could I...?"&nbsp;
Helen looked up at Nina, and the younger woman saw she was really in pain.
<p>"Sure, come on."
<p>Nina led Helen into her room and to her bathroom, where she helped her
friend clean up.&nbsp; Then she put her to bed, tucking her in on one side
before dropping her robe and climbing in on the other.
<p>Both girls were aware that they lay nude in the same bed with the other,
but both had had a busy day, and soon it was forgotten when they went to
sleep.&nbsp; Their last thoughts were about what the future held for them
now.

<br>
<p>Part 22, Ashley's Request.
<p>Nina stood nude as the day she was born under the glorious afternoon
sun.&nbsp; Her hair cascading down her back, her tanned body slim and well
proportioned and a sight for sore eyes.
<p>Of course, eyes were watching the girl as she stood chatting with one
of the gardeners; male eyes could hardly stay off her.&nbsp; Nina paid
them no attention, however; in her own back yard, she hardly noticed the
stir her nudity caused anymore.&nbsp; She was used to the gardeners seeing
her like this; in fact, she enjoyed the attention and sometimes playfully
added a little wriggle to her walk to tease them.
<p>They noticed!
<p>Today however there was no wriggle.&nbsp; And while she talked with
Annabel Clark, who with her brothers kept up with the landscaping for Brian
Cook, Nina's mind was on something else.
<p>Helen.
<p>Ever since the spanking incident, Helen had hardly made an appearance
outside her room.&nbsp; She had removed herself to there before Nina woke
up the next morning, and had pretty much stayed there.&nbsp; Only Mrs.
Terry had been allowed in, and when Nina asked her how Helen was, the housekeeper
told her to just let Helen be for a while.
<p>"She'll be fine, she just needs a little time," Mrs. Terry told her.
<p>Nina was concerned, and that concern was growing.&nbsp; She had made
a concerted effort to go in to see Helen that morning, and found Helen
curled up under the covers of her bed.
<p>Nina tiptoed in and sat with her friend, thinking her asleep, but Helen
soon lifted her head to look at her.
<p>"I...really don't need the company right now," Helen whispered.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "What's wrong, Sweety?&nbsp; Come on, you can tell
me."
<p>Helen looked away.&nbsp; "I can't...there are things I just...I just
need to work a few things out...okay?"
<p>"Was it the spanking?" Nina asked.
<p>"No, not that...well...no."
<p>"Then what?&nbsp; I want to help you!"
<p>Helen waited a beat, then she turned to look at Nina again.&nbsp; There
was something about that look though, that made Nina draw back a little.&nbsp;
For a brief second, Helen looked at her with a hunger that Nina had previously
only seen on some of the men that had seen her naked.&nbsp; It vanished
right away as Helen looked down, but it left Nina unsettled, uncomfortable
with her nudity in front of Helen for the first time in a long time.
<p>"Just go...I'll be okay," Helen said.
<p>Nina stood, her thoughts and feelings mixed.&nbsp; She said the only
coherent thing to enter her head.&nbsp; "Will you be okay for work tomorrow?"
<p>Helen nodded and pulled the covers over her head again.&nbsp; So, after
a moment, Nina left.
<p>For the rest of the day, Nina had worried about Helen, all alone up
there in her room.&nbsp; When Jim called to see if Nina wanted to go out,
Nina begged off, not wanting to leave the house.&nbsp; She didn't feel
like having any fun, not even with Jim.
<p>So now she stood talking about nothing much with Annabel, while looking
every now and again up at the windows of Helen's room.
<p>Movement on the patio behind the house caught Nina's attention, and
the one thing that had made Nina smile over the past couple of days made
an appearance.&nbsp; It was Kelly, only not the Kelly Nina had come to
know.&nbsp; For a start, most of the people Kelly knew in this town would
not have recognized her, for the poor girl was wearing clothes.&nbsp; Not
just shorts and a tank top, which the young woman would have preferred
to wear if she HAD to wear any clothes.&nbsp; But a complete outfit.&nbsp;
Underwear, pantyhose, slip, floor length pleated skirt, shoes, and a high-necked
blouse.
<p>Nina and Helen had missed the lecture Brian had given his granddaughter
the night the policeman had brought her home, but Nina heard all about
it afterward.&nbsp; While Brian had not been very concerned about Kelly's
nude activities before she was caught, he had certainly minded having to
get her out of trouble yet again.&nbsp; He lectured her on restraint and
the need not to flaunt her nudity in front of others who didn't understand.&nbsp;
He was more pissed at her getting caught than with what she had actually
been doing.&nbsp; He was also angry that she had dragged Helen into her
mess.
<p>Of course Kelly tried to explain that this time it hadn't been her fault,
but Brian didn't listen.&nbsp; Instead, acting like the Judge he almost
became before retiring, he sentenced Kelly to clothes until she left to
go back to school; and for at least the immediate future, he demanded that
she dress "Decently."&nbsp; Hence the outfit that wouldn't have been too
far out of place in the 50's.
<p>"And don't think you can just go elsewhere and strip off, young lady,"
he had told her, "I'll know if you step out of that outfit in any inappropriate
place, which for you is anywhere outside your bathroom!&nbsp; I have my
sources; you know I do!"
<p>Kelly was suitably chastised, and did as her grandfather asked.&nbsp;
Still, her rebellious nature couldn't let him win completely.&nbsp; Under
her skirt, she wore thong panties.
<p>Nina sometimes thought of how strange it was in this house.&nbsp; Here
she was, forced to be naked all the time due to the nature of the deal
she had made with Brian Cook, her host, while Kelly was forced to dress.
<p>It made Nina smile.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"It's for you, Miss Kelly," said Mrs. Terry, poking her head into the
den where Nina and Kelly were watching a movie.&nbsp; It was now late in
the evening, and neither of the girls had heard the phone ring.
<p>Curled up on her end of the couch, the very clothed Kelly looked pensively
at the phone before picking it up.&nbsp; The very nude Nina, curled up
at the other end, watched.
<p>"Hi, this is Kelly," Kelly said.
<p>Nina tried not to listen and focused on the movie, but she couldn't
help hearing the agitation in Kelly's voice.
<p>"Look, does it have to be tonight?" Kelly kept saying in one form or
another.&nbsp; "No, she can't come...she...well, you really did a number
on her last time.&nbsp; The way she's been acting lately even has ME worried."
<p>This got Nina's attention, and she looked over at Kelly, who sighed.&nbsp;
She shook her head.&nbsp; "No, I'm not going to ask her," she said into
the phone.&nbsp; Then Kelly looked directly at Nina, her eyes wide and
tinged, Nina thought, with a little fear?
<p>Kelly listened to whoever was talking to her for a moment, then put
her hand over the mouthpiece and sat up.
<p>"Er...Nina.&nbsp; I was wondering...well...I have to go out for a bit.&nbsp;
And...well...I'm supposed to ask if you will come along?"
<p>"Supposed to ask?" Nina said.&nbsp; She felt she knew who Kelly had
been talking to.&nbsp; Kelly had told Nina a little about what had happened
that night.
<p>Kelly nodded.
<p>"Is that the woman that got you guys in trouble?" Nina asked.
<p>Kelly paled a little and nodded again.
<p>"Then why would I want to go see her?" Nina said angrily.
<p>"Please?" Kelly whispered.
<p>Nina shook her head, then had another thought.&nbsp; She was angry with
this woman who had hurt her friend, yet also curious about her.&nbsp; She
wanted to meet the person who was able to cower even Kelly, if only to
give her a piece of her mind.
<p>"Okay, I'll go," she said.
<p>Kelly sighed in relief.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>They pulled up in Kelly's Geo, finding a spot in the crowded lot near
the side.&nbsp; Nina had dithered a lot over what to wear for her first
visit to a lesbian hang out.&nbsp; Something astutely feminine, or ruggedly
masculine.&nbsp; In the end, she settled for jeans and a men's heavy-duty
work shirt, a favorite of hers that she used to wear about the house back
when she wore clothes at home.&nbsp; Nina contrasted with Kelly in her
skirt and blouse; and the sweater Brian had forced on her just before they
left only added to the 50's look.
<p>Nina opened the door to get out, but noticed that Kelly wasn't moving.&nbsp;
She was staring at the entrance to the club as if it led to the gates of
Hell.
<p>"What's the matter?" Nina asked her, concerned.
<p>"I can't go in there," Kelly whispered.
<p>"What?"
<p>"I can't go in there, not like this!" she replied, gesturing at her
clothes.
<p>"Why not?" Nina asked.&nbsp; "Sure, you look a little strange with clothes
on, but you look okay."
<p>"I can't...I just can't!"
<p>"Kelly, stop messing around.&nbsp; You're acting like these people have
never seen you in clothes before!"
<p>Kelly turned to stare at Nina, and Nina opened her eyes in surprise.
<p>"You're kidding, right?" Nina said.
<p>Kelly shook her head.
<p>"You mean you...every time you've come here, you've been...!"
<p>"Yeah...every time."
<p>Nina was shocked.&nbsp; "Well, they're in for a treat then, aren't they!"
<p>Kelly bit her lip.&nbsp; "But...it's not just the nudity...there are
people in there who believe I NEVER wear clothes.&nbsp; That I'm a confirmed
nudist!&nbsp; My whole image in that bar is based on that!"
<p>Nina sat back and looked at the bar for a moment.&nbsp; "You may have
to burst that bubble now."
<p>"I can't.&nbsp; Look, I could get undressed right here, before anyone
spots me.&nbsp; I could walk in there naked and be okay, then get dressed
again as soon as we get back to the car."
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "I can't let you do that, Kelly, as much
as I would like to.&nbsp; You know what your grandfather said; no more
nudity!"
<p>"Nina...please!&nbsp; You can't make me go in that bar with clothes
on, it's...I'll be humiliated!"
<p>Nina sighed and took one of Kelly's hands in her own.&nbsp; "Kel', no
one knows better than me about humiliation, God knows I've been through
a lot of it lately, but I can't let you go in naked.&nbsp; Brian told me
that I am to make sure you stay fully dressed, and that's what I have to
do!&nbsp; If I let you go in there without any clothes on and he finds
out, then I'm going to get it too."
<p>"Get you how?&nbsp; You have that contract, don't you?" Kelly asked.
<p>Nina didn't answer.&nbsp; Sure, there was little Brian could do directly,
but he hinted at telling her boss, Sarah Wickland about it, and with Sarah,
Nina had a slightly different agreement.
<p>"Never mind.&nbsp; You're going in clothed or we go back home.&nbsp;
And then you won't be able to meet this Katie person at all!"
<p>Kelly looked back at the entrance to the club, and stared at it for
a moment, before swallowing and reaching for the door handle.&nbsp; She
hesitated, then she opened it and climbed out.
<p>Nina climbed out of the car as well, and watching Kelly, she was struck
by a weird sense of deja vu.&nbsp; She shook it off.
<p>The two women walked to the front of the club and went in.
<p>Inside, Kelly kept her head down, as if to hide her face.&nbsp; She
felt totally humiliated being here, forced to parade around completely
dressed like some...normal person.&nbsp; She wondered what her friends
were going to think, and dreaded the looks she knew she would be getting
once they recognized her.
<p>Her first trial was just getting in the front door.&nbsp; Sitting in
his usual spot was Carl, the bouncer.&nbsp; The last time Kelly had seen
him, he and Katie had left her and Helen naked and cuffed together in the
woods.&nbsp; Kelly didn't blame the man, but was a little sore that he
had helped Katie.&nbsp; Now she was supposed to stand there with clothes
on while he looked at her.&nbsp; He had never seen her dressed before.
<p>It took Carl a second or so to realize that the somewhat over-dressed
girl in front of him was Kelly, but to his credit, he didn't react much.&nbsp;
Instead, he just smiled a sly smile and waved her on by.&nbsp; His eyes
drifted over Nina, noting that even under her shapeless shirt that she
had a great figure, and smiled.
<p>"Good evening, ladies, come on in!" he said.
<p>Kelly didn't look at him.&nbsp; Instead, she hurried by quickly as Nina
followed her.&nbsp; They made their way into the main part of the club,
and Nina felt overwhelmed by the atmosphere.&nbsp; Loud music echoed off
the walls and people were everywhere.&nbsp; Mostly women, but with a few
men mixed in.&nbsp; Squeezing past some tables on the edge of the dance
floor, Nina stopped to stare at one table occupied by several leather and
rubber clad women.&nbsp; It wasn't the outfits that caught her eye, but
the muscle bound male who knelt at the feet of one of them, practically
naked except for a loincloth and a spiked leather collar about his neck.&nbsp;
A chain ran from the collar to the hand of one of the women, who ignored
him.&nbsp; Nina recognized them.&nbsp; The man was one of Brian's neighbors,
the woman his maid.
<p>"Come on!" Kelly said, tugging Nina's arm.
<p>Nina turned, the word "Wow!" on her lips, and continued on.&nbsp; The
going was a little easier now, and it took Nina a second to realize why.&nbsp;
Kelly had finally been recognized and word was spreading.&nbsp; A lot of
the dancers and a lot of the people at the nearby tables had stopped what
they were doing to turn and stare at Kelly, who continued on with her head
down, blushing.&nbsp; Comments like&nbsp; "What is she doing?"... "Is she
actually wearing clothes?"... "Damn she looks weird"... "She has no dress
sense"... "Wow, what a hotty!" floated by.
<p>Kelly had to resist the urge to uncover, to rip her clothes off.&nbsp;
Being covered up like this in front of her friends was extremely humiliating.
<p>Eventually they got to their table, and for the first time Nina got
to see Katie.&nbsp; The tall brunette rose to meet her, but first looked
Kelly up and down.
<p>"My, my," she said with a smile, "there's something different about
you."
<p>"Shut up, Katie," Kelly said, sinking into an empty chair.
<p>"Why should I?&nbsp; You look delightful in your...sweater!"&nbsp; Katie
laughed, and to Nina it sounded mean.
<p>Katie then turned to face Nina.&nbsp; "You must be Nina; I've heard
a lot about you, welcome!"&nbsp; She held out her hand.
<p>Nina, to her surprise, took it and gave it a light shake before letting
go.&nbsp; "I've heard a few things about you as well."
<p>"Have you?&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; I hope Kelly has filled you in on
a few of our little adventures together."
<p>"Not really, just the last one with Helen."
<p>"Ah Helen...how is she?&nbsp; I was hoping she would be here, I so wanted
her to see the surprise I had for her."
<p>Nina felt her anger rise; she stepped forward into Katie's space.&nbsp;
"Helen is not good at all.&nbsp; She hasn't come out of her room since
she got home that night!&nbsp; What did you do to her?"
<p>Katie wasn't to be intimidated.&nbsp; She leaned forward, almost nose
to nose with Nina.&nbsp; "Jealous?" she whispered with a grin.
<p>Nina stepped back, not expecting that answer at all!
<p>Katie laughed.&nbsp; "Sit down, let me get you a drink.&nbsp; You might
enjoy my little surprise tonight as well!"
<p>"What surprise?" Nina asked, sitting next to a silent Kelly.
<p>Katie just smiled.
<p>Katie signaled for a waitress, and one came over, walking nimbly through
the crowd of people only now getting over the shock of seeing Kelly in
clothing.
<p>Nina didn't pay any attention to the waitress at first, but then she
got a good look at her and all that changed.
<p>She was a young woman around Nina's age, her hair worn up off her neck.&nbsp;
She was in a sort of formal uniform, although it was hard to tell since
there was so little of it there.&nbsp; Her shirt, Nina saw, used to be
a Tux shirt, although all that was left now were the ruffles down the front
and the collar, over which a red bow tie was fastened.&nbsp; The ruffles
covered what they needed to, but only just; Nina saw that any vigorous
action would expose the girl quite easily.&nbsp; Her pants also used to
be Tux pants, but they had been cut extremely short in front, and when
Nina got a look at her behind, the pants were practically a thong.&nbsp;
Fishnet tights and what looked like five-inch heels finished the ensemble,
that and a silver name tag hanging from a chain around her neck with the
name "Ashley" on it (Author note: NO, this isn't Jenny's Ashley).&nbsp;
Nina looked up at the girl's face, and saw that rather than being used
to her outfit, the waitress was rather embarrassed.&nbsp; Nina didn't blame
her.&nbsp; Nina would rather go nude than serve drinks in a place like
this dressed like that.
<p>Katie ordered drinks for them all, and the poor girl left.
<p>"What surprise?" Nina asked again.
<p>"Patience, patience," Katie said.&nbsp; "Now Kelly, I'm DYING to find
out why you're sitting there with clothes on.&nbsp; Do tell!"
<p>Kelly winced, but proceeded to tell Katie all about her punishment.&nbsp;
Katie's eyes glowed.&nbsp; "How delicious.&nbsp; I'm sure we can have some
fun with that!"
<p>Kelly looked at her with fear in her eyes.
<p>Ashley came back with their drinks and handed them out.&nbsp; "Don't
go far," Katie ordered, and the girl nodded.&nbsp; She disappeared back
into the crowd, practically naked from behind.
<p>Katie started asking Nina about her work and where she was from, and
after a few short answers, Nina began to talk more freely.&nbsp; A part
of her mind knew what was happening; yet, Nina couldn't help talking to
Katie.&nbsp; Something about the woman just drew you in.&nbsp; No wonder
she had such a hold on Kelly.
<p>"Ah!&nbsp; Here she is!" Katie said at one point, looking past Nina
toward the entrance to the bar.
<p>Nina turned to follow her eyes and got a shock.&nbsp; Walking toward
them in one of her tailored work suits was Sarah Wickland, Nina's boss.&nbsp;
She didn't look happy.&nbsp; She also seemed quite surprised to see Nina
sitting there, and Nina thought she saw a flicker of apprehension cross
the older woman's face.
<p>Sarah nodded a greeting to Nina, but spoke only to Katie.&nbsp; "What
did you need, Kate?&nbsp; I just got back to town and I'm not in the mood
for games."
<p>"Oh Sarah, stop it!&nbsp; You know you always have time for me," grinned
Katie.&nbsp; "Come, sit."
<p>Sarah stood firm for a moment before sitting at the table.&nbsp; She
looked over at Nina.&nbsp; "I didn't know you knew Kate," she said.
<p>"I...er...only just met her.&nbsp; Kelly brought me.&nbsp; How do you
know each other?" Nina asked.
<p>Sarah glanced at Katie, who smiled.
<p>"She's...a client," Sarah said.
<p>"A client who is positively parched.&nbsp; Go get me a drink, will you
Sarah dear?" Katie asked.
<p>Sarah looked at Katie for a moment, then scanned the bar.&nbsp; The
only waitress in sight was Ashley, but she had her back to them.&nbsp;
"I'll call the waitress," Sarah said.
<p>"No," Katie said icily, "go get me one.&nbsp; You know what I like."
<p>Sarah stared at Katie, then got up and headed for the bar.&nbsp; Nina
was a little stunned.
<p>While Sarah was gone, Ashley came over, and to Nina's surprise placed
new drinks in front of each of them.&nbsp; She quickly disappeared before
Sarah got back.&nbsp; The Legallady saw the fresh drinks on the table and
paused.
<p>Katie picked hers up and took a sip, before looking up at Sarah.&nbsp;
"Oh... Well, as you can see, I already have a drink.&nbsp; You should take
that one back!"
<p>Nina could see that Sarah was getting angry, but she did as Katie asked,
vanishing once more in the direction of the bar.&nbsp; While she was gone,
Katie started talking about Sarah's outfit in rather disparaging tones.&nbsp;
Her voice was loud and carried even over the music, and there was no doubt
in Nina's mind that Sarah heard a lot of it on her way back.
<p>"I mean, take that jacket for example!" Katie said, looking Sarah straight
in the eye.&nbsp; "What an awful color!&nbsp; It does nothing for her eyes
at all.&nbsp; I wouldn't be seen dead in that color combination!"
<p>There were titters of laughter from the patrons nearby, and Nina could
see Sarah flush.
<p>"Take off the jacket, Sarah; I'm tired of looking at you in it!"&nbsp;
Katie ordered.
<p>Sarah looked at her, then glanced about the room.&nbsp; "No, Kate,"
she said.
<p>"It doesn't suit you, dear.&nbsp; You know I'm right, so take it off!"
<p>Sarah leaned close to Katie, and Nina could only just hear her whisper.&nbsp;
"No...not tonight.&nbsp; Not in front off..." she angled her head toward
Nina and Kelly, who were watching.
<p>Katie just smiled; it wasn't a smile that prompted you to smile back.&nbsp;
"Take...it...off!"
<p>Sarah swallowed, then without taking her eyes off Katie, she began to
unbutton her jacket.
<p>Katie shook her head.&nbsp; "No, no.&nbsp; Stand up first, do I have
to tell you everything?"
<p>Sarah stood, and Nina could see that Sarah was very angry.&nbsp; Yet
she did as she was asked, removing the jacket and placing it on the back
of her chair.&nbsp; She remained standing, not looking at anything but
Katie's face.&nbsp; Afraid to, Nina thought.
<p>Nina was amazed.&nbsp; She had never seen Sarah in such a position.&nbsp;
Her boss was usually a woman of power, with Nina in the opposite position.&nbsp;
Now she was seeing the Legallady in a completely different light.
<p>Katie shook her head.&nbsp; "No, it won't do.&nbsp; That skirt is just
as bad as the jacket.&nbsp; Off it comes!"
<p>"Please," murmured Sarah Wickland.
<p>Katie sneered.&nbsp; "I don't know why you thought you could come here
dressed like that.&nbsp; I expect my lawyer to be decently dressed when
she comes to see me.&nbsp; Now, remove that skirt!"
<p>People around were listening and watching now, and Sarah knew that all
eyes were upon her.&nbsp; She spared a quick glance at Nina, who was watching
wide eyed, and then reached for the zipper at her hip.
<p>"Wait!" Katie said.&nbsp; "I don't think everyone can see, and I think
it's best that they do.&nbsp; Climb up on the table!"
<p>"No!" Sarah said, clenching her fists so hard her knuckles were turning
white.
<p>Katie took a sip of her drink, contemplating the lawyer in front of
her.&nbsp; She turned to Nina.&nbsp; "Nina, dear.&nbsp; You work for Sarah
here, don't you?"
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>"I know that there have been times when she has had you...at a disadvantage."&nbsp;
Katie smiled and Nina blushed.&nbsp; "Perhaps you might enjoy helping me
turn the tables?"
<p>Nina's first thought was to say no.&nbsp; But she couldn't honestly
say that the thought of getting back at Sarah Wickland for all the time
she had been forced to go nude in front of people, hadn't occurred to her.&nbsp;
Still, as Katie went on, it was apparent she wasn't required to answer.
<p>"Sarah," Katie said, "perhaps I should have Nina help you with your
skirt, unless of course you wish to step up on to the table and do it yourself!"
<p>Sarah actually blanched, before deliberately stepping onto a chair and
then on to the table.&nbsp; Visible to most of the club now, who was watching
all this, Sarah unzipped her skirt and dropped it on the table.
<p>"Messy girl!&nbsp; Fold it up and put it neatly on the back of the chair,"
Katie said.
<p>Sarah did so, then stood up straight.&nbsp; She was now dressed in her
blouse, what looked like a slip, stockings, and her shoes.
<p>Katie shook her head and sighed.&nbsp; "Really, Sarah.&nbsp; Where did
you get that blouse?&nbsp; It looks like something you bought at Kmart!"&nbsp;
There were laughs from the crowd and Sarah's color returned.&nbsp; She
blushed but didn't look at anyone.
<p>"Take off that blouse at once, it's embarrassing!"&nbsp; Katie said.
<p>Sarah closed her eyes and tugged at the buttons.&nbsp; As she did so,
Nina looked around, not eager to see her boss's humiliation.&nbsp; She
couldn't catch Kelly's eye, she saw nothing but satisfaction in Katie's,
and to her surprise, she saw deep pleasure in Ashley's.
<p>Sarah pulled off the blouse to show that she was indeed wearing a full-length
slip.&nbsp; She folded the blouse and laid it on top of her skirt and jacket.
<p>Sarah Wickland had a great body and the slip showed it off well.&nbsp;
The lines of her underwear were plainly visible as well.
<p>Katie took another sip of her drink and then tossed the rest of it at
Sarah.&nbsp; The lawyer gasped and put her hands over where the drink had
soaked her slip.&nbsp; She whirled on Katie, and Nina thought she was going
to kick her.&nbsp; But instead, she stopped and just stood there, breathing
deeply.
<p>Katie just smiled.&nbsp; "Well we can't have you standing there dripping
on the table.&nbsp; You had better get that slip off so we can dry it!"
<p>The crowd chuckled, and some of the women added their pleas for Sarah
to remove her slip.
<p>Shaking, the lawyer reached for the hem of her slip, then paused a few
seconds before lifting it over her head.&nbsp; She pulled it off and stood
with the dripping garment in one hand, unsure as to where to put it.&nbsp;
Without the slip, everyone could plainly see her white satin bra and panties,
cut high over her hips.
<p>Katie pointed at the neatly folded clothes.&nbsp; Sarah shook her head.&nbsp;
"It will mess them up as well," she said.
<p>Katie shrugged and picked up Nina's untouched second drink, she poured
it all over Sarah's folded clothes.&nbsp; "Now it won't matter," she said.
<p>Sarah stared in shock.&nbsp; "Why...why are you doing this?" she asked.
<p>Nina herself wondered HOW.&nbsp; How did Katie get Sarah to humiliate
herself?
<p>Katie looked up, all innocent.&nbsp; "Why, it's a birthday present!"
<p>"Birthday?" Sarah asked, puzzled.
<p>Ashley pushed her way to the front of the crowd.&nbsp; "Mine!"
<p>Sarah looked over at her and frowned.&nbsp; "Ashley!"&nbsp; To Katie
she said, "You're not serious!"
<p>"Of course I am!" replied the brunette.&nbsp; "I thought Ashley deserved
a treat for being so good the past year, so I promised her a little public
humiliation for her former boss."
<p>'FORMER boss?' Nina thought.
<p>Sarah growled.&nbsp; "Well I've had enough.&nbsp; I'm not going to be
humiliated by that___."
<p>"I have a request!" Ashley said, her face stern and focused.
<p>"What is it, dear?" Katie asked, smiling.
<p>Ashley smirked.&nbsp; "I want to see her spanked."
<p>"NO!" Sarah all but screamed.
<p>Katie and a lot of the surrounding women laughed.
<p>"And," continued Ashley, pointing,&nbsp; "I want HER to do it!"
<p>Everyone looked where Ashley was pointing, all except for Nina who was
the one being pointed at.&nbsp; She stood up.&nbsp; "Oh no, I'm not going
to!"
<p>Sarah shot her a grateful look before Katie got to her feet as well.&nbsp;
"I think that's a wonderful idea!"
<p>Nina backed away.&nbsp; "No, no way!"
<p>Ashley took a step forward, then looked to Katie.&nbsp; "Ma'am.&nbsp;
Can I talk to her in private a moment?"
<p>Katie nodded and Ashley came around to where Nina was standing.&nbsp;
She guided Nina over to where Sarah couldn't hear them speak.&nbsp; "It's
Nina, right?" she said.&nbsp; "Well, Nina.&nbsp; As you heard, I used to
work for Sarah.&nbsp; I spent two years as her paralegal at the firm you
work at, and believe me, I know what you are going through.&nbsp; When
she found something on me good enough to hold over my head, I rarely got
to wear anything at work again.&nbsp; I won't even GO into the humiliating
situations she put me through, situations that got worse as time went on.&nbsp;
But suffice to say that in the end I had to quit and got passed...well,
I came to work for Katie."
<p>"Why are you telling me this?" Nina said, horrified.
<p>"Because I know your future.&nbsp; I don't know what she has on you,
but I know she won't let it go.&nbsp; You've already had to strip for some
clients, right?&nbsp; Do you really think that's as bad as it will get?&nbsp;
Don't get me wrong, she won't do anything sexual to you, she isn't like
that, but there are other ways of humiliating you.&nbsp; So here's the
deal.&nbsp; I've been waiting three years to be in a position of power
over that bitch, and thanks to Katie, it's here and now.&nbsp; But it won't
last.&nbsp; I'm offering you a chance to take part, because who knows when
you'll ever have the chance again!"
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; "But how...what does Katie have over Sarah?"
<p>Ashley shook her head.&nbsp; "I don't know.&nbsp; Honest I don't.&nbsp;
All I know is that they have a connection.&nbsp; I shouldn't even say that
much.&nbsp; Look, are you in?"
<p>Nina looked up at Sarah.&nbsp; Katie had gone on humiliating her while
she and Ashley were talking, and Sarah now had her bra undone.&nbsp; Flushed
not from embarrassment but with anger, she dropped her bra onto the pile
of wet clothing amid the cheers of the crowd.
<p>Nina closed her eyes.&nbsp; "No...I'm not in.&nbsp; And I think you
should stop it now.&nbsp; What does humiliating her get you anyway?"
<p>"A little payback," replied the barely clad waitress.&nbsp; She shrugged,
almost popping out of her brief outfit.&nbsp; "Well, if you won't...!"
<p>Nina watched as Ashley pushed her way back to the table.&nbsp; She stood
and watched as Sarah pulled down her panties while the crowd cheered her
on.&nbsp; She was almost at the door when she clearly heard over the silent
group the first contact of hand and flesh.&nbsp; Nina didn't stay for any
more.&nbsp; She went out to the car.
<p>Twenty minutes later, feeling sorry for her boss and worried for herself,
she saw people start to come out of the club.&nbsp; Among them was Sarah,
still nude except for her stockings and shoes.&nbsp; The Legallady made
a run for her car, got it unlocked after much fumbling, and climbed in.&nbsp;
She drove away without looking back at the large group of women who laughed
and jeered her.
<p>Nina hung her head.
<p>Not long after, Ashley appeared and walked over, looking around nervously,
for she was still in her very brief outfit.&nbsp; She stopped at Nina's
side of the car.
<p>"Katie wants you to come back in."
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "No fucking way.&nbsp; I want nothing to
do with her."&nbsp; Nina had worked up her own anger now.
<p>Ashley looked worried.&nbsp; "Please.&nbsp; She said she would make
Kelly strip unless you came in."
<p>"She told you that?" Nina asked the near naked girl.
<p>Ashley nodded.
<p>"Well, tell her she can go screw herself.&nbsp; I bow to her now; I'll
never get free.&nbsp; I have...too much on my plate already!"
<p>"What about Kelly?"
<p>Nina sighed, then got out of the car.&nbsp; "Well, she wanted to be
nude in there anyway.&nbsp; Tell her I caught a cab home!"&nbsp; Nina turned
and walked away, leaving Ashley to stare at her.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina told no one about what happened, she just went to bed when she
got home.&nbsp; She was still awake though when she heard Kelly get in
hours later.&nbsp; Her footsteps in the hall outside Nina's room were easily
identifiable in the quiet of the night.&nbsp; The steps stopped right outside
Nina's door and it opened.&nbsp; Nina rolled over to see Kelly walk into
her room.&nbsp; Kelly was nude once more and Nina could see red marks like
bruises all over her body in the dim moonlight streaming through the huge
windows of her room.
<p>Kelly walked right up to the side of the bed Nina lay on and slapped
her face, hard!&nbsp; "Bitch!" she said, half in tears.
<p>Nina lay stunned, her left cheek on fire, as Kelly turned and left,
and Nina wondered if leaving her behind had been a good idea after all.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--***--
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next morning she was summoned as usual up to the Legallady's office,
and as usual, she had to undress in front of Franklin, who locked her clothes
away.&nbsp; In the inner office, Sarah got down to business right away
and didn't say anything about the night before.&nbsp; In fact, it was hours
later before Nina heard anything from the woman that could have been a
reference to it.
<p>"I got a call from Brian this morning," Sarah said in the middle of
going over a legal brief.&nbsp; "He told me that he had...asked you to
make sure that his granddaughter Kelly didn't get into trouble.&nbsp; He
sounded disappointed in you, and tried to convey that disappointment to
me."&nbsp; Sarah looked Nina straight in the eye.&nbsp; "You can...consider
me disappointed...but I think I'll stay out of this one."
<p>Nina nodded, not knowing what to say, but feeling that she had just
gotten a reprieve from something nasty.
<p>They both went on working.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 22.

<br>
<p>Part 23, Overtime.
<p>When working for a legal firm, one gets used to putting in long hours,
especially when one is low on the firm's totem pole.&nbsp; Usually however,
the more affluent the firm, the more exclusive the clientele, the more
likely that the said firm can keep normal office hours.&nbsp; That didn't
mean however that there was NEVER a need to burn the midnight oil, just
that it didn't happen very often.
<p>It was happening tonight in the suite of offices run by Sarah Wickland.&nbsp;
The Legallady was preparing to go to court the next morning and needed
all her case files ready for trial.&nbsp; She enlisted the aid of Franklin,
her secretary, and Nina, her paralegal, for the job, telling them both
that it would mean a couple of hours overtime after the firm's regular
hours.&nbsp; It turned out to be rather longer when the beady-eyed lawyer
discovered a figure wrong on some statistical discoveries.&nbsp; It meant
checking them all, adding three more hours to the job.
<p>Nina didn't mind the extra work; it was all on the job training for
her, and despite all the other things that she had gone through since starting
this job, she was grateful for the chance to get a leg up on law school,
whenever she decided to go.&nbsp; But the downside of this little job was
having Franklin staring at her most of the night.
<p>It was bad enough just coming up to work in Sarah's exclusive suite.&nbsp;
Every visit longer than a very brief stop meant Nina removing all her clothes
in Franklin's office, where he would then lock them away so she couldn't
get them back.&nbsp; Then Nina would have to do whatever task Sarah needed
her for, while being completely nude.&nbsp; She wasn't asked to do anything
that wasn't job related, which relieved Nina no end, but still she felt
handicapped having to work nude.
<p>Still, at least Sarah didn't put Nina on display.&nbsp; Nina always
worked in private, usually in the conference room next door or in Sarah's
office, with only Sarah and sometimes Franklin in attendance.&nbsp; As
far as Nina knew, only Sarah, Franklin, and her friend Helen knew of the
strange arrangement.&nbsp; Sarah had basically blackmailed Nina into stripping
for her, and Nina had yet to think of a way to get out of it.
<p>It wasn't on her mind this night though, as she closed in on the bottom
of the pile of paperwork she had been reading for the past three hours.&nbsp;
She was stretched out on the floor, face down and up on her elbows, papers
scattered around her, listening to Chopin on Sarah's office stereo and
trying to focus her tired eyes on just one more page.
<p>Sarah herself sat at her desk, and from her seat she could look over
her OWN paperwork to watch the naked paralegal.
<p>Sarah would smile every time she did so, for Nina looked quite attractive
lying there, one foot up in the air, her hair splayed out across her nude
back, her deeply tanned skin almost unblemished in the soft light of the
room.&nbsp; She was a piece of art fine enough to shame the Grecian items
in the room.&nbsp; God created Man to worship him...God created Woman to
prove to man that he could indeed build perfection!
<p>The two women were alone; Franklin had gone home not long before.
<p>Nina yawned and stretched, her long swimmer's body showing every muscle
as she tried to work the kinks out.&nbsp; She looked up at a clock sitting
on a nearby shelf and saw it was close to 10:00 pm.&nbsp; "Oh man," she
said quietly.&nbsp; Nina had gotten a ride to work as usual from Helen,
who had moved back into her own apartment a week before.&nbsp; Helen still
wasn't the bubbly friend Nina had known, but she was a lot better than
she had been a week ago.&nbsp; She had offered to come pick Nina up whenever
she got done, but Nina hadn't anticipated staying so late.&nbsp; But it
was only going to be a little longer; they were almost done.
<p>Another pressing need made itself known to the young woman, and she
looked over at her boss.&nbsp; "Sarah, I need to go use the restroom,"
she said.
<p>"That's fine, Nina, go right ahead," Sarah answered, not looking up
from the paper she was reading.
<p>"Er...my clothes?"&nbsp; Nina asked.&nbsp; Except for the very first
time Nina had come up to work for Sarah, Nina had always gone to the bathroom
dressed.&nbsp; Even if all she wore was a dress and nothing else, it was
better than going naked.
<p>Sarah looked up.&nbsp; "Nina, dear.&nbsp; We are probably the only people
left in the building except for Mel and Ester the security guards at their
desk down in the lobby.&nbsp; I think you can get to and from the bathroom
without the need for clothes."
<p>Nina paused, not liking the thought of leaving the suite naked again,
but realized that Sarah was probably right.&nbsp; The last time she tried
this was during office hours, and she had almost been caught.&nbsp; There
wouldn't be anyone around now.&nbsp; She could probably wander the building
at will and not have to worry, as long as she stayed away from the ground
floor where the corpulent couple sat and devoured doughnuts all night.&nbsp;
Nina had often wondered why the firm hired such inept looking security
guards; it certainly wasn't for their dominating presence.&nbsp; Too fat
to more than waddle around, Nina sometimes couldn't tell them apart.&nbsp;
Both had breasts AND a hairy upper lip.
<p>Nina shrugged, knowing that she had to go and that Sarah wouldn't back
down anyway, and stood up.&nbsp; She stretched once more to alleviate the
cramp of lying on a floor for several hours, and padded out to the outer
office.&nbsp; She passed through, only pausing long enough to test the
closet door behind which her clothes were trapped; it was locked, so she
opened the outer door to the corridor.
<p>She peeked out; no one was around, and she decided it was safe.&nbsp;
So she jogged quickly to the ladies' room down the hall.&nbsp; What she
failed to notice as she left was how the inner door to Sarah's office slowly
swung closed, cutting most of the music off via its soundproofing, and
how the outer office door clicked when it also swung closed.
<p>By this time, Nina was sitting on her throne, happy that at least she
didn't have to fumble with a skirt and panties, risking a spill.&nbsp;
She could just plop down and open up.
<p>Nina smiled in relief, the bladder-emptying kind of relief that all
know so very well, and thought to herself that there were benefits to a
nude lifestyle after all.&nbsp; She also smiled in anticipation of what
she might be doing this time the following night.&nbsp; She and Jim were
going out.
<p>Nina finished her bathroom routine, and feeling much lighter on her
feet, walked casually back to Sarah's office.&nbsp; Everything was fine
up until she tried the handle to the door.&nbsp; It was locked.
<p>A sharp stab of concern pierced Nina's heart as she struggled with the
handle for a moment.&nbsp; She looked up and down the hallway for a moment,
knowing that no one was around, yet scared anyway.&nbsp; She knocked on
the door.&nbsp; "Sarah!" she called out, afraid to make too much noise.&nbsp;
"Sarah, I'm locked out!&nbsp; Let me in!&nbsp; Sarah!"
<p>Nina kept banging on the door and twisting the handle, afraid that her
boss might not be hearing her over the music in the office.&nbsp; She was
making so much noise that she almost didn't catch the telltale sound of
the elevator coming up.
<p>Live or work in any building long enough, and you know the sounds it
makes.&nbsp; You can tell what is happening even if you can't see it.&nbsp;
Nina had come up to this floor so often that the unique sounds of the elevator
had imprinted themselves on her mind.&nbsp; Now, in the quiet of the office
building, her mind heard those sounds, and in its agitated state sent an
alarm all over Nina's body.
<p>Nina suddenly felt cold, and she looked down the hall toward the elevator
doors.&nbsp; It would be there in seconds!
<p>Beyond were the bathrooms, her first choice for a hiding place, but
there was no time to get there.&nbsp; She had to go the other way.
<p>Nina ran as fast as she could to the bend in the hallway at the other
end.&nbsp; She was on the Senior Partners' floor, with each of them getting
a suite of offices like Sarah's, so the hallway didn't really go very far.&nbsp;
She made it around the corner just as the elevator doors began to open,
and the frightened girl ducked and hid.&nbsp; Panting, the nude young woman
crouched low on the plush carpeting.
<p>Nina could hear heavy breathing and the crackle of a walkie-talkie.&nbsp;
She figured it had to be Mel, or maybe Ester.&nbsp; It didn't really matter;
they were both unpleasant.&nbsp; She had only met them a few times, and
each time they both complained constantly about whatever was in their heads
without ever actually saying anything.&nbsp; Nina wondered if they liked
anything except for the food they gorged themselves on.
<p>Still, she didn't want to be found by either one of them, and as she
heard the heavy breathing begin to come closer, she looked around wildly
for a place to hide.&nbsp; There wasn't much.&nbsp; A potted fern that
might work in a cartoon, but otherwise nothing.&nbsp; That is, except for
the staircase at this end of the hall.&nbsp; It was behind a door for fire
safety, and Nina was crouched almost next to it.
<p>Having nothing to lose, Nina sprinted over to the door and opened it.&nbsp;
The staircase was bare concrete, again for fire safety.&nbsp; It didn't
look all that inviting, but Nina didn't have a choice.&nbsp; She carefully
closed the door behind her and began to go down.
<p>Her choice of direction was forced upon her by the fact that she was
on the top floor.&nbsp; She went down a couple of flights and tried the
door, not wanting to stay in the open of the concrete stairway.&nbsp; There
had to be a place to hide where she could call Sarah to come down with
something to wear!
<p>The door was locked.
<p>"Shit!" Nina swore.&nbsp; She hated this, being so vulnerable.
<p>A door opened above her, and Nina heard steps on the concrete.&nbsp;
Nina wondered what the bastard was doing up here.&nbsp; His post was at
the desk in the lobby, not waddling around the building!
<p>Again, Nina was out of choices.&nbsp; She moved quickly and silently
down to the floor below.&nbsp; This time she struck gold and the door was
unlocked.&nbsp; She passed through onto one of the lawyer's floors, where
the associates had their offices, and looked around for a place to hide.
<p>She was tempted to duck into one of the bathrooms as she passed them,
but she wanted a phone, so she didn't.&nbsp; She turned a corner and walked
out into the open secretarial pool.&nbsp; Eight desks arranged in a tastefully
designed open plan showed where the secretaries of the lawyers on this
floor did their work, and each desk had a phone.
<p>Nina was about to reach for the nearest when she heard the door to the
stairway open.
<p>Nina couldn't believe her bad luck.&nbsp; Of all the floors to pick,
he picked THIS one!&nbsp; Trembling, Nina looked about again for a place
to hide.&nbsp; The pool was too open for her to stay hidden for long, so
ducking behind a desk here was out.&nbsp; On the other side was the elevator,
but that would only work if it was right there waiting for her, and Nina
didn't feel that lucky.&nbsp; She began to frantically try each of the
offices surrounding the secretarial pool, in the hopes that one of them
was unlocked.&nbsp; She could hear the heavy breathing and the heavier
footsteps of the security guard walking down the short hallway that led
into this room as she tried each door.&nbsp; She was just thinking that
she wasn't going to get away this time when she practically fell through
one of the doors.&nbsp; Moving very quickly, Nina closed the door and stood
with her ear pressed against it, listening.
<p>She hadn't noticed that the room was occupied.
<p>"Excuse me?" said a male voice that made Nina's blood turn very cold.
<p>Certain that she was done for, that her job here at the firm and her
hopes of becoming a lawyer were finished, Nina slowly turned to see whose
office it was.
<p>"Miss West?" said the man in shirtsleeves, sitting at his desk, his
eyes open in amazement.
<p>"Mr. Bell?" Nina replied, amazed herself that the only other member
of the firm, as far as she knew, who had seen her nude just happened to
have been whose office she had stumbled into.
<p>"What are you doing?" Donald Bell asked her, his eyes taking in her
image.&nbsp; He had last seen her nude on the beach outside his home; an
image then that fueled a few erotic fantasies for him.&nbsp; He never expected
to see her like that again, especially someplace where the lighting was
so much better.
<p>"Er..." said Nina completely at a loss for words.&nbsp; Then came a
knock at the door, making Nina jump.&nbsp; She looked helplessly at Bell
and mouthed the words,&nbsp; "Help me!"
<p>Bell froze for a second and then pushed his chair back from the desk.&nbsp;
He pointed under his desk and Nina made a mad dash, backing into the space
in order to fit.&nbsp; Bell scooted forward again, his legs on either side
of her.
<p>The knock sounded again, and Bell called out for the person to come
in.&nbsp; It turned out to be Mel, his uniform stained with something or
other and straining to contain him.&nbsp; In one hand he held a long black
flashlight, in the other a two way radio that buzzed.
<p>Breathing heavily, he stepped into the room and gave it a once over
before focusing on the lawyer.&nbsp; "Evening, Mr. Bell.&nbsp; Working
late tonight?"
<p>"I sure am, Mel; was there something I could do for you?"
<p>Mel let his little piggy eyes scan the room once more as he spoke.&nbsp;
"I don't suppose you..."&nbsp; He stopped, licked his lips, and smiled.&nbsp;
"Never mind, I guess I was mistaken."
<p>"Never mind about what, Mel?" Bell asked him.
<p>"Nothing important.&nbsp; I'll just head back to the lobby.&nbsp; Sorry
to have interrupted your...work."
<p>Bell scowled.&nbsp; "You do that, Mel."
<p>Mel grinned as he left the room, pulling the door closed behind him,
thinking of the ten pink toes visible under the vanity board of Donald
Bell's desk.&nbsp; As soon as he did so, Nina struggled to rise but Bell
motioned for her to stay.&nbsp; They paused for a moment, wondering if
Mel was going to come back, then after a few minutes began to breath easier.
<p>Bell looked down at the lovely nude young woman between his legs, her
eyes wide with fright.&nbsp; It was a sight that would have moved most
men, and Bell was no exception.&nbsp; Blushing, he pushed backwards away
from the desk, and released the also very embarrassed Nina, who had noticed
his movement, from her captivity.
<p>"Now can I ask why you're running around the office without any clothes
on?" he asked.
<p>Nina swallowed, she really didn't know what to say.&nbsp; "I...er...thanks.&nbsp;
For not turning me in," she finally came up with.
<p>"Well...I owe you.&nbsp; You saved my son, I have a long way to go to
pay back that debt," he said seriously.
<p>Nina bit her lip.&nbsp; "I'd consider us even, if you asked no questions
and didn't say anything about it."
<p>"We'd be far from even, but I'll do as you ask.&nbsp; No questions...except
one.&nbsp; Are you okay?&nbsp; Mel wasn't...well...you know?&nbsp; Because
if he was, I'll have him fired so damn fast___!"
<p>"No!&nbsp; Don't blame him.&nbsp; He had nothing to do with it.&nbsp;
And I'm okay, thanks."&nbsp; She smiled at him, touched by his concern
and remembering that frantic swim in the ocean where she had saved his
boy from drowning.&nbsp; "I have to go; do you think he's gone?"
<p>Bell stared at her for a moment, then reached for his phone.&nbsp; He
punched a couple of numbers and listened.&nbsp; "Hey, Mel.&nbsp; Sorry
I was so curt with you, it was just the wrong moment.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp;
Thanks pal."&nbsp; He put down the phone.&nbsp; "He's back in the lobby,"
he said to her.
<p>Nina nodded and opened his office door.&nbsp; With one last look at
the lawyer, she slipped out.
<p>Nina made for the desk closest to the stairway, thinking how lucky she
was for it to have been Donald Bell that saved her, and used the phone
to dial Sarah's office.
<p>It was picked up on the third ring.
<p>"Sarah Wickland's office!" said the Legallady.
<p>"Sarah, it's me, Nina."
<p>"Nina!&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; You've been gone an awfully long time!"
<p>"I got locked out of your office and you didn't hear me knocking.&nbsp;
I had to find a phone.&nbsp; Could you stand by the door and let me in?"
<p>Nina could hear Sarah laughing.&nbsp; "Oh my.&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp;
I forgot that Franklin usually sets the lock when he leaves.&nbsp; Of course
I'll open the door for you.&nbsp; Will you be right up?"
<p>"I'll be right there, don't go anywhere!" Nina replied.
<p>Nina ran back to Sarah's office, again taking the stairs because she
just didn't trust the elevator not to take her to the lobby.&nbsp; She
reached the door to Sarah's suite and tried it.&nbsp; The door was still
locked.
<p>"Sarah!" Nina yelled, banging on the door.&nbsp; A few seconds later
a grinning Sarah opened it and Nina bounded inside.&nbsp; She felt worn
out!
<p>Sarah chuckled as she led the girl back into the inner office.&nbsp;
"Well, while you were out having fun I finished all the work.&nbsp; I'm
heading home.&nbsp; Do you want a ride?"
<p>"Yes...yes please!" said Nina, grateful for the offer.
<p>Sarah nodded and gathered her things, still smiling.
<p>Nina knew that Sarah was probably getting off on her embarrassment,
and didn't put it past the woman to have deliberately ignored her pleas
to come in earlier.&nbsp; Nina was reminded of what the waitress at the
lesbian bar had told her about Sarah.&nbsp; The Legallady enjoyed these
games and would push for more extreme ones.
<p>Nina was glad this one was over.&nbsp; She was wrong.
<p>As they passed through the outer office, Sarah strode right past the
closet holding Nina's clothes, which Nina loudly called her attention to.&nbsp;
Sarah turned, her face like a stern schoolteacher's.&nbsp; "Well, they
are hardly needed now," she said, "after your wandering all over the building.&nbsp;
It's not like you have anything to hide anymore!"&nbsp; She opened the
office door and Nina sprang forward to pull her back.
<p>"Wait!&nbsp; What are you talking about?&nbsp; I NEED my clothes to
leave the building!"
<p>"Nina, I know ALL about your little jaunt to Donald Bell's office.&nbsp;
Ester called me just before you did and told me the whole story.&nbsp;
By the way, did you know he's a married man?&nbsp; Naughty Nina!"
<p>Nina was shocked.&nbsp; "But how...?" she tried to ask.
<p>Sarah stepped out into the hallway and pointed at a dark tinted quarter
glass globe up in the corner where the wall met the ceiling.&nbsp; Nina
had noticed them spread through all the public areas of the building, but
didn't give them any thought.&nbsp; "Cameras," Sarah said simply.&nbsp;
"How do you think people of Mel and Ester's...condition...keep track of
the building and watch over it?&nbsp; Ester watched your entire progress
at her station in the lobby while Mel tried to catch you to ask what you
were doing.&nbsp; It became fairly obvious to him when he saw you in Donald
Bell's office."
<p>Nina was still stunned.&nbsp; Cameras?&nbsp; "But I was under..." she
started to say, and then shut her mouth.
<p>Sarah grinned.&nbsp; "Under the desk, yes, in a very compromising position
from what Mel said he saw." Sarah stepped right in front of the girl and
looked her in the eyes.&nbsp; "Tell me, Nina; you aren't involved with
Donald Bell, are you?"
<p>"No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; He just...helped me hide!"
<p>Sarah narrowed her eyes, then her smile returned.&nbsp; "Very well.&nbsp;
I don't think you're the type to cheat on anyone; I believe you.&nbsp;
Now come along, I have a long drive ahead of me."
<p>"But...my clothes?" Nina asked, too overloaded with the knowledge that
she was now on camera to think straight.
<p>Sarah didn't answer, she just headed for the elevator.&nbsp; Nina had
no choice but to follow.
<p>In the lobby was the final humiliation.&nbsp; They had to sign out of
the building at the security desk, and Sarah wouldn't hear of Nina hiding.&nbsp;
"They know you are coming down," Sarah said, "they've seen you naked already.&nbsp;
You might as well do your job and sign out properly."
<p>Nina was too stunned and embarrassed to protest much.&nbsp; She meekly
followed Sarah across the brightly lit lobby and stood silently while both
Mel and Ester looked her up and down.&nbsp; Sarah deliberately stood there
and chatted with the corpulent couple, getting along better with them than
anyone else Nina had ever seen talking to them, before leading Nina out
the front doors of the building and into the executive parking lot.
<p>Nina had never expected to walk through those doors completely nude,
but she was doing so now.&nbsp; She wondered what else Sarah might have
her do.
<p>To her surprise, it was nothing...that night anyway.&nbsp; All Sarah
did was drive straight to Brian Cook's house and let the naked girl out.&nbsp;
Before she got out of the car though, Nina had a question.
<p>"Is it all over for me there?" she asked, almost in tears.&nbsp; "Will
Mel tell everyone what he saw?"
<p>Sarah smiled softly and put a hand on Nina's shoulder.&nbsp; "Mel won't
tell anyone anything, not unless I say so.&nbsp; He and I have a good working
relationship, and I can trust both him and Ester not to blab.&nbsp; They'll
probably just make a private tape of the affair and watch it at home."
<p>"Tape?" Nina said, worrying even more.
<p>Sarah chuckled.&nbsp; "Yes, I'll have to get you a copy.&nbsp; Now go
to bed.&nbsp; I'll pick you up at eight on the way to court tomorrow.&nbsp;
You DO have a clean suit don't you?&nbsp; Or would we have to swing back
by the office to retrieve your clothes?"
<p>Nina got out of the car, listening to her boss laugh at her.&nbsp; She
didn't look back as she walked over to the gate intercom and didn't look
around while she stood nude, waiting for the gate to open.
<p>She was just too tired to care.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 24, Trust Me!
<p>Nina West was excited, and tried to concentrate on the finishing touches
of her makeup.&nbsp; Her boyfriend, Jim Barb, was taking her out tonight
for "Something special," as he put it.
<p>Nina wondered what it could be, and her imagination was running a little
wild.&nbsp; That Jim had money had not escaped her attention, and while
she tried to think that it didn't matter, sometimes she wondered what it
might be like to have a rich husband.
<p>"I'm NOT a gold digger," she said to herself, chiding herself for the
selfish thoughts.
<p>"Of course not, Miss Nina," said a voice from behind her, making Nina
jump.&nbsp; She looked behind her to see Mrs. Terry, the housekeeper, place
a pair of high heels and a thin gossamer wrap on the bed.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry
was of course nude, as was Nina.&nbsp; The former by choice, the latter
as the result of the arrangement she had made with the owner of the house.&nbsp;
Continuous nudity while on the grounds was her rent for living here, a
rent that Nina sometimes found hard to pay.
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; "Thank you, Mrs. Terry, but where's the dress?&nbsp;
I especially wanted to wear that new ruby red creation of IO's tonight!"
<p>Nina had gone shopping especially for this date, and the dress designer
hadn't disappointed her.
<p>Mrs. Terry looked up at the younger woman, approving of the light touch
of makeup Nina had applied.&nbsp; She thoroughly approved of the match
between Jim and Nina, although she kept such opinions to herself.
<p>"Mr. Barb called just a little while ago," she said, always formal.&nbsp;
"He asked that I not let you dress before he arrives, and that while you
may wear any jewelry you choose, I am to ask you not to wear any earrings.&nbsp;
He also said...to trust him."
<p>Mrs. Terry couldn't help smiling softly, her normally dour expression
banished for the moment.
<p>Nina scowled.&nbsp; 'Damn him' she thought, 'why can't we just have
one regular date like everyone else?'
<p>"Was that everything he said?" Nina asked.
<p>"That was everything.&nbsp; He should be here very soon, I think."
<p>Nina nodded and turned back to her mirror.&nbsp; Her makeup table mirror
reflected her from the waist up, and an annoyed Nina regarded her reflection
critically.&nbsp; She had spent most of her time nude since arriving at
this house, and that counted time spent off the property where her landlord's
rules didn't apply.&nbsp; As a result, her skin held a deep tan and glowed
under most lighting, accenting the color of her hair.&nbsp; Her muscle
tone was excellent due to her daily workouts swimming in the pool, and
there was yet to be any sign of sagging that she knew would come eventually
if she kept going around without a bra.&nbsp; She tried to look at herself
as a man would; the shape of her breasts, the curve of her neck now visible
because she was wearing her hair up, and wondered just what&nbsp; it was
that made men want to see her naked all the time.&nbsp; Especially Jim.&nbsp;
He had told her once that he was going to avoid seeing her in clothes for
as long as he was able to do so, and so far, he had succeeded.&nbsp; Not
since the night they met had he ever seen her wear anything that actually
covered her.
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; It was actually a bit of a turn on for her, his quest.&nbsp;
She felt flattered in a way.&nbsp; She might have felt offended had she
the feeling that it was all he wanted out of her, a naked date.&nbsp; But
when they were together, Jim had a way of talking to the inner Nina as
well, and seemed just as interested in her too.
<p>Nina wasn't quite as put out by Jim's request as she had been a few
minutes before, and she finished her makeup and took off the earrings she
had planned on wearing.&nbsp; 'No earrings?&nbsp; I wonder what he has
planned tonight!' she thought.&nbsp; Then she felt a little devilish, thinking
that if he wanted to see her intimate parts, then he was going to get an
eyeful tonight.&nbsp; She used some rouge to heighten the color of her
nipples and, after some thought, her labia.&nbsp; Not a lot, but enough
to make them just a bit more noticeable.
<p>Getting up, slipping on her heels, and ignoring the wrap, Nina could
feel her excitement gather.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>She got her first inkling of what Jim had planned once she got downstairs.&nbsp;
Parked outside in the driveway was a stretch limo, its driver standing
at near attention by the back door.&nbsp; Nina blushed when she saw him,
knowing the driver could see her through the glass front of the house,
but he didn't give any sign he had seen her.&nbsp; Nina's focus however
quickly switched to Jim, who stood in the lobby of the house with Brian
Cook, her host.&nbsp; Jim was in a tuxedo, looking extremely elegant, while
Brian was in a much more casual outfit of slacks and shirt.
<p>Jim had watched Nina come down the stairs, unable to take his eyes off
her.&nbsp; Normally Nina went barefoot, but tonight her heels added a sway
to her walk that Jim found very appealing.&nbsp; It was a given that he
had a smile on his face.
<p>Nina walked up to him, intending to ask why she wasn't allowed to dress
THIS time, but the sight of the driver had shaken her a little and she
was blushing slightly.
<p>Brian smiled, seeing her embarrassment.&nbsp; It was for such brief
moments that he made the arrangement with the lovely young lady.
<p>"Nina, you look lovely!"&nbsp; Jim told her, taking her hand, his eyes
naturally drawn to her nipples as Nina planned they would be.
<p>"I look just the same as always," Nina replied, getting her courage
back.&nbsp; "It's hard to look different when you aren't allowed clothing!"
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "Oh you are mistaken.&nbsp; Every time I see you,
it's like seeing you for the first time."&nbsp; He bent low to kiss her,
and Nina blushed once again.&nbsp; She was keenly aware of her situation,
standing nude where three men could see her while being kissed by one of
them.&nbsp; It made her heart thump harder.
<p>"I...er..." she began, trying to regain her composure, "I had hoped
that I would get to wear something tonight.&nbsp; I got a dress especially
for this date.&nbsp; Couldn't I please go put it on?"
<p>Jim shook his head.&nbsp; "Not tonight, I have other things planned."
<p>Nina scowled until Jim kissed her once again.&nbsp; This time he held
her close as he did so, and Nina wrapped her arms about him.&nbsp; A discreet
cough alerted the couple that they were not alone.&nbsp; Nina flushed furiously
as she and Jim parted.
<p>Brian smiled, an idea forming in his head, but he wasn't going to voice
it now.&nbsp; Instead, he wished the couple a happy night and escorted
them to the door.
<p>Nina was nervous, looking at the limo driver, who still acted like she
wasn't standing naked before him, and hesitated to go out.&nbsp; But Jim
took her hand and whispered, "Trust me," into her ear.
<p>Inside, the limo was very plush and well equipped, and Nina felt very
odd, her bare flesh sinking into the soft upholstery.&nbsp; She wondered
if a nude woman had ever been in there before.&nbsp; Jim sat with her,
and in moments the limo was on the move.
<p>"Jim," she said, "please let us stop so I can put something on.&nbsp;
You can't be serious about taking me out like this!"
<p>"You'll be fine, trust me.&nbsp; I have everything arranged," he replied.
<p>"Don't I get any say in this?" Nina asked, both flattered and annoyed
with how Jim always took charge when they were together.
<p>"What did you tell me you wanted to do the last time we were together?"
he asked her.
<p>"Go on a normal date," she said as they pulled off the property and
left behind the last chance for her to put anything on.&nbsp; "You know,
dinner and a movie?"
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "Well, you got your wish."
<p>"Like this?" Nina asked, looking at his tux and her nude body.
<p>"Trust me, its all been arranged.&nbsp; But first, a little gift for
you," he said, reaching into an inside pocket.
<p>Say "Gift" to most women, and you get their attention.&nbsp; Nina was
no exception, especially when that gift was inside the kind of box only
found at a jewelers.&nbsp; This one was about six inches long and Jim didn't
actually give it to her.&nbsp; Instead, he opened it himself and then presented
it to her.
<p>Nina smiled, and looked inside to find what looked like two gold strings.&nbsp;
Looking closer, she could see they were earrings, about four inches long.&nbsp;
Threads of gold wire threaded through many very thin silver and gold tubes.&nbsp;
Each earring had two such threads, one slightly longer than the other.
<p>"They're lovely," Nina said, thinking them more unusual than lovely.
<p>Jim smiled, and took one out.&nbsp; It lay like gossamer in his hand.&nbsp;
"A one-of-a-kind set.&nbsp; Been in the family a long time.&nbsp; My mother
gave them to me not long ago, said to pass them on to the girl of my dreams."
<p>Nina looked up at him, thinking him joking.&nbsp; But he looked very
serious.&nbsp; "I can't take those," she said.
<p>"Why not?&nbsp; You ARE the girl of my dreams, you know.&nbsp; Here,
let me."&nbsp; He moved forward and Nina closed her eyes as he fumbled
with her left ear.&nbsp; She heard a slight snap and felt the weight of
the threads hanging from her ear lobe.&nbsp; Surprisingly, they were not
at all heavy, and were just long enough to brush her naked shoulder and
the side of her neck.&nbsp; Another snap and the right ear held its companion.
<p>"Beautiful," Jim said, smiling.
<p>Nina felt herself blush under his gaze and looked about for a mirror.&nbsp;
There was one in a vanity across from where she sat, so she moved to look
at it, kneeling on the limo's floor.&nbsp; The gold and silver threads
sparkled in the dim light, and Nina's opinion of them grew.&nbsp; She could
feel them brush against her skin as she moved her head, and enjoyed the
touch.&nbsp; It was like that of a lover, delicate and intimate, and she
blushed some more.
<p>"Thank you," she said, turning to face Jim, "but I can't accept something
so valuable from you.&nbsp; You should save them for when you're really
sure who you're giving them to."
<p>Jim looked at the kneeling woman, taking in her beauty.&nbsp; "I've
never been more sure," he said, making Nina look down in embarrassment.&nbsp;
Jim chuckled and helped Nina back into her seat, holding her tightly.&nbsp;
It wasn't long before they began to kiss once more, an occupation that
lasted them until they arrived at their first stop.
<p>As the limo slowed to turn into the parking lot, Nina looked up and
paid attention to what was outside the car for the first time since leaving
the house.&nbsp; What she saw stunned her.
<p>"This is 'Maestro's'," she said.
<p>"Yes."
<p>"This is a five star restaurant!"
<p>"So the guide says, yes."
<p>"This is a very full five star restaurant!"
<p>"Oh I agree, it looks quite busy tonight," said Jim with a smile.
<p>Nina looked at him like he was crazy.&nbsp; "Jim, there is NO WAY I'm
going to go in there without any clothes on.&nbsp; You would have to be
completely mad to think otherwise!"
<p>Jim took her hands in his.&nbsp; "Trust me."
<p>"Trust you!&nbsp; Unless you have something for me to wear in this car,
you are sadly mistaken in thinking that I would just walk in there arm
in arm with you without my having a stitch of clothing on!"
<p>Jim waited, looking her in the eyes until Nina calmed down a bit.&nbsp;
"Nina, I said to trust me and you can.&nbsp; I do NOT expect you to walk
in there like you are with everybody watching.&nbsp; I agree that it would
be way too much for you, not to mention the fact that I'd be way too jealous
to show off your beauty like that."&nbsp; He grinned and Nina couldn't
help smiling back, but she was still worried.
<p>"So what are you planning?" she asked him.
<p>The limo had pulled through the parking lot and driven around to the
back of the restaurant.&nbsp; It stopped near one of the back doors.&nbsp;
Jim gestured to it.&nbsp; "It's all been arranged, Nina.&nbsp; We go in
this way, through the kitchen, and directly to a table in the restaurant
set up especially for us.&nbsp; No one but the kitchen staff and the floor
staff will see us; we'll be effectively screened from the rest of the restaurant,
although we will see everyone else.&nbsp; We will be able to dine in private
while enjoying the ambiance and food of this...five star restaurant...without
you having to worry."
<p>Nina swallowed.&nbsp; "So no one will see me, except for the people
who work here?"
<p>Jim nodded.
<p>"What if I don't want to be seen by the people who work here?" she asked
him.
<p>He smiled.&nbsp; "You can trust to their discretion and their professionalism.&nbsp;
Besides, I think you are more excited by the prospect than you let on!"
<p>Nina flushed, but upon reflection she was feeling a bit excited.&nbsp;
All she had to do was walk through the kitchen and let all the employees
of the place see her.&nbsp; It didn't sound hard, and it wasn't as if she
hadn't been seen naked by countless strangers already the past few months.&nbsp;
There was also the sinfully delightful prospect of dining nude in such
a place with no one else the wiser.&nbsp; Yes, she was excited, and she
wondered how she could possibly even consider it.&nbsp; She knew that a
month ago she wouldn't have dared.
<p>"Nina?" Jim asked.
<p>Swallowing, Nina nodded.
<p>Jim grinned, and moved to knock on the closed divider between them and
the driver.&nbsp; The driver got out, went to the back door of the restaurant,
and knocked.&nbsp; Presently a man in formal attire opened it, and the
driver came back to the car to let them out.
<p>"Maestro doesn't run much of the business anymore," Jim said to Nina
as they waited, "his son has taken over for the most part.&nbsp; He'll
be the one guiding us to our table."
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; When the time came, she stepped bravely out of the
car, her high heels adding a grace to her movement and giving her a vulnerability
she didn't need.&nbsp; She turned to look around, but no one else was in
sight except for the son of Maestro waiting at the door.&nbsp; The man
was of course all eyes.
<p>Jim took Nina's arm and led her over to the door, while the limo driver
went to park the limo.&nbsp; "Mr. Maestro, may I present Nina West," he
said.
<p>Maestro looked up and smiled.&nbsp; He took Nina's hand and gave it
a theatrical kiss.&nbsp; "A pleasure, a real pleasure.&nbsp; I hope you
enjoy your stay."
<p>"I hope so too, Mr. Maestro," Nina replied, with a soft smile of her
own.
<p>Maestro tore his eyes away from her for a moment to talk to Jim.&nbsp;
"All is as you requested, Mr. Barb.&nbsp; Everything has been set up."
<p>"You're sure that no one will be able to tell Nina is nude?" Jim asked.
<p>"Most certainly.&nbsp; I even had the staff responsible for setting
up your dining area walk naked to your table themselves at the height of
the dinner hour.&nbsp; If there had been any doubt, that would have shown
it, but they all complied.&nbsp; You and the lovely lady will be able to
dine in private."
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; Well, shall we go inside?"
<p>Nina was glad to get indoors, although stepping inside brought her under
the scrutiny of about a dozen people.&nbsp; She held on to Jim's arm and
tried not to blush too much as the entire kitchen staff paused for a moment
to take her in.&nbsp; Nina remembered the added "touch" she had made to
her nipples and labia, and regretted the action as twelve pairs of eyes
locked on to her.&nbsp; Then Maestro junior clapped his hands and ordered
the staff back to work, which they reluctantly turned back to.
<p>"This way, please!" he said to the couple, and started off.
<p>Nina could still feel eyes on her as she walked through the kitchen,
and her heart pounded in her chest like it was about to come out.&nbsp;
She couldn't believe she was deliberately walking through a kitchen in
front of strangers, NAKED, and that she was about to walk nude into a public
restaurant, AGAIN!
<p>Unlike the last time though, this was not a place were nudes were rarely
seen but welcome anyway.&nbsp; This was a whole different ball game.&nbsp;
Still, Nina couldn't help feel naughty as they passed through the kitchen,
and she added a little wriggle to her walk, grinning inwardly as she did
so.&nbsp; She was pleasantly surprised to feel that she was actually having
fun!
<p>They passed some of the waiters waiting for the food they were to take
to the tables they waited on, and out into the main part of the restaurant.&nbsp;
Nina held her breath, expecting to be seen, but a single step put her behind
a translucent screen lit up from the outside.&nbsp; The screen flowed around
a single table set for two.
<p>"From the outside, the screen is impenetrable," said Maestro, "but as
you can see, you can see through it from this side very easily."
<p>Nina sure could, it was like the screen was barely there, and the people
on the other side couldn't fail to notice that a nude woman had joined
them for dinner.&nbsp; She was seated by Jim, and sat nervously just a
few feet away from the nearest diner.
<p>"I'll be right back," Jim said, whispering in her ear, and she watched
him walk around to the other side of the screen.&nbsp; She saw him smile
and nod before he came back and seated himself.&nbsp; "Very well done.&nbsp;
The lighting even matches the decor of the place, and Nina, you're invisible,
so relax."
<p>Nina sighed, trusting Jim.&nbsp; He could have been having her on, but
the mere fact that no one else in the restaurant had gotten up and pointed
at her suggested that she was indeed invisible.&nbsp; She grabbed for the
wine list.
<p>The meal was excellent, the service impeccable, although Nina was amused
to note that they were rarely served by the same waiter twice.&nbsp; It
seemed that every employee of the place managed to find an excuse to come
behind the screen and check her out, male AND female.&nbsp; That Nina sat
with her back to the screen, and that she was positioned so the table barely
hid her, made sure they got an eyeful.&nbsp; Nina resigned herself to being
looked at and enjoyed the extra service it provided.
<p>Jim just grinned, and his only comment during the meal about it was
that he didn't think he'd need to leave much of a tip.
<p>Otherwise their talk was intimate, personal, and Nina enjoyed every
minute of it.
<p>The meal however was eventually completed, and the son of Maestro himself
came to bid the couple goodbye.&nbsp; He led them once more back though
the kitchen area, and Nina was given one more surprise.&nbsp; Before they
could step through the door, the kitchen staff began to politely applaud
and both Nina AND Jim blushed at the unexpected attention.&nbsp; Then one
of the cooks, a young woman about Nina's age, walked up with a flat white
cardboard box in her hands.
<p>"I hope you don't think we're too forward," she said, glancing at Maestro
junior, who looked on but didn't interrupt.&nbsp; "But we thought you might
want a little something to remember the evening by.&nbsp; So I made you
this."
<p>The cook opened the box, and inside Nina and Jim saw a chocolate heart
about eight inches across.&nbsp; Carved into the heart was a sketch, in
chocolate, of Jim and Nina sitting at their table.
<p>Nina blinked, totally blown away.&nbsp; "Thank you," she whispered.
<p>The cook grinned and closed the box again, handing it to Jim.&nbsp;
The couple then left the restaurant and walked directly to the limo that
was parked and waiting for them.
<p>"Wow," Nina said once they were inside.
<p>"Yeah," Jim agreed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>They didn't travel far before the limo once again pulled into a parking
lot.&nbsp; This time it was for the local multiplex.
<p>"The movie?" Nina asked Jim.&nbsp; "Don't tell me, you arranged for
a screened off portion of the movie theater so we have to watch with the
rest of the crowd!"
<p>"Not quite," Jim said with a smile.
<p>"Not quite?&nbsp; What are we doing then?&nbsp; Wait, I got it.&nbsp;
We watch from the projector room with all the people that work here coming
in to see if we need any more popcorn!"
<p>Jim laughed.&nbsp; "No, just wait and see."
<p>Nina was in good spirits, but again she was worried.&nbsp; She wondered
what the man had planned for her this time.
<p>The limo pulled up behind the movie theater and stopped near an exit.&nbsp;
A woman was already standing in the open doorway waiting for them.&nbsp;
The driver got out and opened the limo door for them, and Nina again felt
butterflies as she stepped nude from her only concealment.&nbsp; She also
kept feeling the earrings Jim had given her, brushing her neck and shoulders
almost constantly and driving her to distraction with their intimate touch.
<p>Jim took her arm and they hurried to the door, going in right away.&nbsp;
Nina wasn't sure what she expected to see inside, but what she did see
wasn't it.&nbsp; It was a perfectly normal theater, no curtains or screens
or any place to be concealed.&nbsp; It was also empty.&nbsp; Nina stood
wondering what was going on while Jim thanked the manager, for that was
who the woman was, for her help with this date.&nbsp; She only gave Nina
a brief glance before walking away and leaving them alone.
<p>"Let's go find a seat," he said.
<p>"What's going on?" Nina asked him, feeling vulnerable.
<p>"I bought out an entire showing of the movie," he replied.&nbsp; "Every
seat here for one showing.&nbsp; We have the place to ourselves."
<p>"You mean no one else is coming in here?" Nina said.
<p>"Not a soul.&nbsp; Even the projectionist won't be looking.&nbsp; We
have the place to ourselves!"
<p>Nina grinned and followed Jim to the center of the theater where he
had selected a couple of seats.
<p>"Say Jim," she said, standing in a deliberately provocative pose once
she reached him, "since we're going to be all alone in here, perhaps you
could do something for me.&nbsp; After all, I'm doing so much for you tonight."
<p>Jim's eyes were riveted on the gentle sway Nina put in her hips, and
he smiled.&nbsp; "Er...sure, what ever you say?" he said without thinking.
<p>Nina grinned.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; Take off your clothes!"
<p>Jim blinked.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Snuggled naked against the nude body of a man Nina felt she was really
falling in love with, Nina watched the previews, and asked what movie they
were watching anyway.
<p>"Oh, I found a special copy of one of my favorites from when I was a
kid."
<p>"You mean this isn't a first run movie?" Nina asked.
<p>"Nope!&nbsp; This one stars Scott Baio."
<p>When he told her the title, she thought it sounded like something only
an electrician would enjoy, but she soon saw why it appealed to him.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>They were now back in the limo, and much to Nina's disappointment, Jim
was back in his clothes.&nbsp; She had tried daring him to finish out the
date nude as she was, but he smiled and shook his head.&nbsp; "Someone
has to keep their shirt on," he said.&nbsp; Nina volunteered and had even
gone so far as to grab his tux shirt and start to put in on, when he tackled
her and tickled it from her grasp.
<p>Now they were riding again, Jim in his tux and Nina nude, cuddling him.&nbsp;
She didn't pay much attention to where they were going until they started
climbing high in the hills surrounding the landward side of the town.&nbsp;
Nina knew there were some pretty big estates up here, big money funding
them.
<p>"Where are we going now?" she asked him.
<p>Jim took a deep breath before answering.&nbsp; He tried to look confident
but Nina could see he was worried about answering her.&nbsp; "Do you trust
me?" he said to her eventually.
<p>Nina blinked.&nbsp; "I think that this evening has proved that I trust
you, although if you continue to evade the question, that trust may begin
to wither!" she replied.
<p>Jim took another breath.&nbsp; "My...parents...want to meet you," he
said.
<p>It took Nina a moment to realize that they were going to see his parents
NOW.&nbsp; "Are you out of your MIND?" Nina said.&nbsp; "How can you expect
me to meet your parents like this!"
<p>"It'll be okay," Jim said.
<p>"I don't care if it is okay or not!&nbsp; The first impression your
parents get of me is not going to be of me running around naked with their
son!&nbsp; You're CRAZY!" she said, pulling away from him.
<p>Jim closed his eyes.&nbsp; "It's not what you think.&nbsp; Believe me,
it's okay."
<p>"How can it be okay?&nbsp; Tell me that, huh?&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp;
Are your parents nudists?&nbsp; Will they be naked too?&nbsp; If that's
the case, Jim, I still don't want to see them, not like that!"
<p>"They're not nudists and they won't be nude," Jim replied.
<p>"Then how can it be okay?" Nina demanded to know.
<p>Jim pressed his lips together before answering.&nbsp; "I can't explain,
it's better that you see.&nbsp; But trust me, it will be okay."
<p>"And if I said no...would you take me anyway?" Nina asked quietly.
<p>Jim leaned over and held her hand.&nbsp; "You can always say no, to
anything we do.&nbsp; I might try my hardest to convince you otherwise,
but in the end if you say no, then that's okay and we will stop.&nbsp;
I won't MAKE you do anything if you are bound and determined not to do
it.&nbsp; Okay?"
<p>Nina stared at him for a moment, then nodded slowly.&nbsp; "Are you
sure that this is the right time, the right way, for me to meet them?"
<p>"Nina, oh my beautiful Nina, there is no better time or better way for
you to meet them.&nbsp; Trust me!"
<p>Nina trusted him.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The house was large, the grounds expansive.&nbsp; Nina would have been
more impressed had she not been so nervous.&nbsp; The limo pulled up in
front of the house, and as usual, the limo driver opened the door for them.&nbsp;
Jim stepped out and held out his hand for Nina.
<p>Nina hesitated.&nbsp; "I can't do this," she said.&nbsp; "No, I'm not
going to."
<p>Jim looked apprehensive for a moment, then pointed to one side of the
big double doors that led into the house.&nbsp; "Look over there," he said.
<p>Nina did so, and it took a moment for her to see what Jim was pointing
at.&nbsp; When she saw it, she gasped.&nbsp; Standing on a marble pedestal
was the nude statue of her that Jim had bought at the auction, the one
he paid $80,000 for.&nbsp; He had never told her what he had done with
it.&nbsp; Now she was finding out.
<p>Nina couldn't look away from it for the longest time, but she eventually
managed to look back at Jim.&nbsp; "Do they know everything?"
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "About you, they know a lot, and they love the statue.&nbsp;
They moved one of my mother to put it there in its place."
<p>"Your mother?" Nina asked.
<p>"Come, please.&nbsp; It's easier to show you."
<p>Trembling, Nina took his hand and stepped out of the limo.&nbsp; She
allowed him to guide her up the steps to the house, to lead her through
the doors and into the most amazing room she had ever seen.
<p>The lobby of the home Jim's parents lived in was an art gallery.&nbsp;
It was devoted to original works with one common theme, the nude female.&nbsp;
Nina didn't recognize any of them, but she saw a very broad range of styles,
from cubist paintings to modern art sculpture.&nbsp; Many different models
were represented, but one face and body seemed more prevalent than most.&nbsp;
Nina noticed that the model had aged, depending on the work.&nbsp; In some,
she was young, as young as Nina.&nbsp; In others, she could have been...
<p>"Your mother?" Nina said to him.
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; "My parents both have had a passion for this sort
of art ever since I could remember.&nbsp; My mother was a model in Paris
when my father met her.&nbsp; They fell in love and married and he brought
her back here.&nbsp; She continued to...model...for years and still does
from time to time.&nbsp; I doubt there is an artist in this town, Brian
Cook included, that hasn't done a nude of her."
<p>Nina had begun to wander about the room, looking much like a piece of
art come to life in this room of nudes.&nbsp; She examined many of the
pictures and statues as she moved around.&nbsp; "She's very beautiful,"
she said.&nbsp; "Even her more recent portraits show off her beauty."
<p>"Thank you, cheri," said a female voice from nearby, and Nina stood
up to look while Jim moved to her side.&nbsp; She saw a man and a woman
standing together in a doorway.&nbsp; The man, from his looks, had to be
Jim's father.&nbsp; The woman was the one from the paintings.
<p>Nina began to blush, aware that she was indeed meeting Jim's parents
without a stitch of clothing on.&nbsp; Yet in THIS room, it didn't quite
seem to matter as much.
<p>Jim's mother, wearing a long white flowing gown that flapped loosely
about her as she walked, approached Nina with a gentle smile on her face.&nbsp;
"We are so very pleased to meet you," she said.&nbsp; "My son has told
me a lot about you.&nbsp; You are as beautiful as we imagined."
<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Barb.&nbsp; But I'm sorry to appear this way; it wasn't
my idea."
<p>"Oh...my name is Yvette, dear Nina, and my husband is Tom.&nbsp; Please,
we can't be so formal.&nbsp; And don't worry about appearing before us
as you are.&nbsp; We insisted he bring you thus; isn't that right, Tom?"
<p>Tom Barb grunted, and Nina got the idea the man didn't say much.
<p>Yvette smiled again.&nbsp; "I suppose this is all a shock to you; you
didn't expect James's parents to be so free minded!"
<p>"It was unexpected," Nina admitted.
<p>Yvette laughed.&nbsp; "A normal reaction.&nbsp; But I see you are still
uncomfortable being the only real nude here.&nbsp; No mind, I will help
you feel better."&nbsp; Before Nina could react, Yvette pulled at a string
at the neck of her gown, and it pooled at her feet.&nbsp; There was no
denying that Yvette had lost none of the looks from her youth, and it gave
Nina hope for her own future.
<p>Yvette smiled and took Nina's hand.&nbsp; "Don't worry, I am normally
nude at home.&nbsp; Tom there, he hates me in clothes.&nbsp; When we met,
I was modeling a nude for Asnwar Alam.&nbsp; I don't know how he managed
it, but Tom managed to keep from seeing me in any clothes almost up until
we got married!&nbsp; Men!"
<p>Nina, startled, glanced back at Jim as Yvette led her away.
<p>Jim winked and mouthed just two words.
<p>"Trust me."
<p>She did.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 25, New Rules.
<p>The law library at the firm was huge.&nbsp; It had to be.&nbsp; Not
because it held a complete set of law books, but because it held five!&nbsp;
It was a two-tiered room, divided into sections dependent on what kind
of law you needed to reference, and in fact didn't hold all the law books
in the building.&nbsp; Most of the lawyers had their own little incomplete
collections in their offices, usually concentrated on their specialties.
<p>Yet, when it came to most research, this was the room in which to do
it.&nbsp; It was a room usually occupied by paralegals.&nbsp; Nina West
was up here often, for a paralegal rarely went more than a few days without
needing to access the library.
<p>She was there now, at a table near the back with Helen, three large
piles of books in front of each of them, and a large pile of scattered
notes covering the rest of the available surface.&nbsp; The two of them
were digging up past case files for Sara Wickland, the Legallady.
<p>"Here's one," Helen said, shaking her head and tossing back her hair.&nbsp;
She handed the book over to Nina, who took it and started to read, or at
least she tried to.&nbsp; She was distracted by two other paralegals at
a table on the other side of the bookcase behind them.&nbsp; The unseen
man and woman were having a conversation and laughing about anything but
work.
<p>Like most libraries, silence was the rule here, but obviously these
two didn't care.&nbsp; Then, something they said caught Nina's ear.
<p>"Did you hear about the Legallady?" the man said.
<p>"What, do tell," replied the woman.
<p>"Well, the senior partners are having their big board meeting right
now, right?&nbsp; I hear that Sarah Wickland is on her way out!"
<p>Nina blinked and looked up from her book.&nbsp; She caught Helen's eye;
she also looked startled.&nbsp; "Do you think...?" Helen started to say,
but Nina waved her to silence.
<p>"No, you're kidding!" the woman said.
<p>"Nope, I'm serious.&nbsp; I heard it from Annie, Roth's secretary.&nbsp;
She said that he was talking about how fed up the other partners were of
the kooky clients Sarah Wickland keeps bringing in."
<p>"Wow.&nbsp; But I thought those clients brought a lot of money to the
firm!"
<p>"They do, but Roth and the others are sick of them coming here and embarrassing
the regular clients.&nbsp; Heck, there's a rumor that one of them was running
around the building last week completely naked.&nbsp; Someone has a tape
off the security cameras or something."
<p>Nina began to blush.
<p>"Someone told me it was one of the lawyers," said the woman.&nbsp; "Apparently
he had sneaked in a girlfriend for some late night fun!"&nbsp; Both of
them laughed.
<p>"No, Roth is pretty sure it has something to do with Sarah Wickland.&nbsp;
He and the other partners want her and her clients gone."
<p>"Wow."
<p>Nina was shocked.&nbsp; The Legallady, gone?&nbsp; Was there really
a chance that she would gain some freedom at last to be able to work like
a normal person?
<p>The librarian passed by at that moment and began ragging on the couple
on the other side of the bookcase.&nbsp; No more was to be heard from them
after that.
<p>"Could it be true?" Helen asked her friend.
<p>"I don't know, I hadn't heard anything!" Nina replied.
<p>Neither of them could really concentrate after that.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina got a summons to the office of Sarah Wickland later that day.&nbsp;
With trepidation, Nina went.
<p>She entered the outer office of Sarah's suite to find Franklin, Sarah's
secretary, at his usual place behind the desk.&nbsp; The greasy man looked
up and smiled as Nina entered, making Nina think that the news couldn't
be so bad.
<p>"Do I need to...you know?" Nina asked him, gesturing at his closet.
<p>"Do you need to what?" he asked smugly.
<p>Nina swallowed, not wanting to lose her temper, yet hating this man
more and more with each day.&nbsp; But she had to play these games with
him.&nbsp; "Do I need to get undressed?"
<p>"Undressed?&nbsp; Can you tell me what you mean by undressed?"
<p>Nina wanted to punch that smug smile.
<p>"I mean, do I have to take my clothes off?"
<p>Franklin looked at her for a few seconds.&nbsp; "Maybe if you described
HOW you would take your clothes off, I might be able to tell you if you
need to or not."
<p>"Franklin!"
<p>"Just do it!"
<p>Nina hesitated.&nbsp; "Do I need to bend over and remove my shoes before
shrugging off my jacket and hanging it in the closet.&nbsp; Are you going
to make me unzip my skirt and drop it to the floor so I can bend over and
pick it up before hanging THAT in the closet.&nbsp; DO I have to stand
here facing you while I unbutton my blouse and remove it, leaving me in
just my panties and bra?&nbsp; WILL I HAVE to remove them as well, exposing
my body once more to your SICK little gaze so you can lock my clothes away.&nbsp;
DO I HAVE TO DO ALL THAT?"
<p>Franklin frowned at her tone of voice.&nbsp; "Show me your tits."
<p>"What?" Nina said, amazed.
<p>"Show me your tits!&nbsp; Open your shirt and show me your tits!"
<p>Nina angrily undid her jacket and blouse, pulling them open to expose
her bra-clad breasts.
<p>Franklin shook his head.&nbsp; "The bra too."
<p>Humiliated, Nina undid the front clasp of her bra and opened it up.&nbsp;
She stood silently while Franklin licked his lips and stared.&nbsp; "Okay,
you can go in now."
<p>Nina sighed and began to put herself away, but Franklin stopped her.&nbsp;
"No, go just like that."
<p>"You're fucking sick, Franklin," Nina said, "I'll be glad when you're
gone."
<p>Franklin frowned.&nbsp; "Gone?"
<p>Nina looked at his confusion for a moment, then shrugged.&nbsp; "Never
mind."&nbsp; She went past him and opened the door to Sarah's office, still
bare breasted.
<p>Inside, she saw Sarah standing by one of the big windows behind her
desk, staring out.
<p>"Sarah?"&nbsp; Nina said.
<p>"Come here, Nina," Sarah said softly.
<p>Nina looked out the window at the office building across the way.&nbsp;
She normally stayed away from the windows when working in these offices
nude, and was very conscious of the fact she was practically topless.&nbsp;
She moved slowly toward her boss until she stood behind her.
<p>"Come...look," Sarah said, again without turning.
<p>"I'd rather not, Ma'am," Nina said, not wanting to expose herself to
the world.
<p>"What?" Sarah said.&nbsp; She turned to look at Nina and frowned.&nbsp;
"Oh, I'm sorry, Nina, I didn't know you'd be topless.&nbsp; Franklin?"
<p>Nina nodded and Sarah chuckled.&nbsp; Sarah seemed to forgive Franklin
a lot, making him Nina's cross to bear.&nbsp; "Well, close your jacket
over those lovely breasts of yours and come look...right down there."
<p>Grateful, Nina did as she was bid and followed Sarah's pointing finger
until she could make out what Sarah was looking at.&nbsp; It turned out
to be the roof of an apartment building a block down.&nbsp; Lying on a
blanket taking in the sun was a naked body...male...very well endowed.
<p>Sarah laughed.&nbsp; "He's out there most afternoons, and can be seen
from several of the buildings around here.&nbsp; I think he does it just
to thrill us ladies, he can't NOT know that we can see him.&nbsp; For almost
a year, he's been doing it.&nbsp; You'd think someone would have called
the police on him, exposing himself like that.&nbsp; But so far no one
has."&nbsp; Sarah sighed.&nbsp; "I'm going to miss this view!"
<p>Nina looked over at her, thinking that the rumors were true.&nbsp; Sarah
really was out!&nbsp; "Miss the view?"
<p>"It's what I want to talk to you about.&nbsp; At the partner's meeting
today, it was decided that I had to leave.&nbsp; I'm to be gone by the
end of the week."&nbsp; She moved toward the phone.
<p>"Gone?" Nina said, amazed and confused.
<p>Sarah nodded.&nbsp; "Will you be sad to see me go?" she asked, picking
up the phone and dialing.&nbsp; She looked directly at Nina.
<p>"Well sure!" Nina said.
<p>Sarah grinned.&nbsp; "Liar...Hello...I'd like the police, please.&nbsp;
My name is Sarah Wickland, and I'd like to report a man exposing himself...thank
you."&nbsp; She put her hand over the phone.&nbsp; "I think you would be
glad to see me go, you and Helen both!"
<p>Nina didn't know what to think really.&nbsp; Parts of her were jumping
for joy, while other parts hated the fact that Sarah was leaving.
<p>Sarah got on with her phone call.&nbsp; "Yes...there's a man exposing
himself, he's lying naked on a blanket on the roof of a nearby apartment
building...Yes, I can see him clearly from my office window, as can no
doubt several hundred other people...I don't know why they aren't calling
you, but I am, and I want you to do something about it!&nbsp; Corner of
Whitman and Eighth Street. Thank you.&nbsp; I expect a prompt response
on this."&nbsp; She hung up the phone and went back to the window.&nbsp;
"Oh, Nina, you can't fool me.&nbsp; I know that you'd rather work with
anyone else in this building but me."
<p>"That's not true," Nina said, surprised that she meant it.&nbsp; "Working
with you has taught me a few things about my life and my prospects.&nbsp;
When I was in college, I hoped that I would find a female role model in
my chosen career, and...well...while you haven't been quite what I expected,
you have taught me that being a woman doesn't mean accepting the glass
ceiling a firm like this normally puts up.&nbsp; You...inspire me."
<p>Sarah turned to stare at Nina.&nbsp; "Such passion!&nbsp; I had no idea."&nbsp;
To Nina's surprise, the woman actually looked uncomfortable.&nbsp; "I expected
you to hate me, considering what I make you go through."
<p>"I don't...hate you," Nina replied, wanting out if this conversation.
<p>Sarah turned back to the window.&nbsp; "Thanks.&nbsp; I'm glad to hear
that, Nina.&nbsp; It makes it easier."
<p>"Makes what easier?"
<p>"It makes it easier to tell you that I plan on you coming with me.&nbsp;
Oh, and Helen too."
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; "Coming with you?&nbsp; Did they fire us too?"
<p>Sarah chuckled and turned back to Nina.&nbsp; "Who said anything about
getting fired?&nbsp; No one is getting fired!"
<p>"But...you said you were leaving...and I heard the other partners were
fed up with you!"
<p>"Ah...the rumor mill strikes again!&nbsp; You shouldn't believe everything
you hear, Nina, although in this case they are mostly right.&nbsp; You
look puzzled."
<p>Nina WAS puzzled.&nbsp; "I don't understand."
<p>"It's very simple.&nbsp; Yes, I'm leaving; WE'RE leaving.&nbsp; But
not because we've been fired.&nbsp; We are simply moving to new offices.&nbsp;
The partners feel that the...exotic nature of some of my clients reflects
badly on the firm's image, despite the fact that they are some of the firm's
wealthiest contributors.&nbsp; So it has been decided that I and my staff
will be moved to separate offices where we can meet and greet our clients
without fear of them contaminating the regular folk."
<p>"What?" Nina said, unable to digest this shift in fortunes.
<p>"I'm quite excited really.&nbsp; Getting out on our own.&nbsp; The firm
has leased a building down on Ocean Boulevard; we'll have the entire place
to ourselves."&nbsp; She turned to wink at Nina.&nbsp; "Just think of the
FUN things we can do there all by ourselves."
<p>Nina's blood ran cold.
<p>"Look," Sarah said, pointing out the window again.&nbsp; Nina looked
and saw several police cars parked in front of the apartment building where
the nude man lay sun bathing.&nbsp; She was just in time to see four officers
emerge on the roof and rush him.&nbsp; She couldn't see faces very well,
but the guy looked surprised.&nbsp; The cops stood him up and cuffed him
without covering him up, before leading him away.&nbsp; Minutes later he
appeared, still nude, on the street below as he was led to a squad car.&nbsp;
He was patted down and shoved into one of the cars before being driven
away.
<p>Sarah smiled and moved away from the window.&nbsp; "As I said, I'll
miss the view."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If anything, the view was better, and if it hadn't been for other things,
Nina would really have enjoyed working at the new location.&nbsp; The building
was indeed on its own on the landward side of Ocean Boulevard, facing the
beach and the water beyond.&nbsp; Prime real estate if you could get it,
and apparently the firm could!&nbsp; Nina was told it used to be a small
grocery store, which explained the large parking lot and the glass front
of the building.&nbsp; Inside, however, the place looked nothing like the
store it used to be.&nbsp; All the glass had been tinted so that even if
you placed your head against it you couldn't look in, but from the inside
you could have an unrestricted view of the outdoors, much like in Brian
Cook's home, Nina thought when she saw it.
<p>The place had two client entrances, one right up front, and one hidden
discreetly around the back.&nbsp; Neither one could be entered without
a key or without someone inside opening the door, so no one could simply
walk in on them.
<p>Inside, the place was laid out in a two-level, open-plan format, except
of course for Sarah's office and the office of the second lawyer attached
to Sarah's staff by the rest of the senior partners.&nbsp; More about him
in a moment.
<p>These offices were on the second level, with the law library between
them and an elevator to one side with the stairs on the other.&nbsp; On
the first level were two more open offices, a conference room, break room,
bathrooms, and so on.&nbsp; Quite well laid out, but with few walls to
break the eye, only the bathrooms were screened.&nbsp; The entire place
still smelled of new paint, but it had been beautifully decorated with
Sarah's eye for Grecian art, and looked fantastic.
<p>As promised, Sarah had brought her staff along, and Nina and Helen were
BOTH seconded to Sarah Wickland on a permanent basis, much to their mutual,
yet not unexpected, shock.&nbsp; But there were two other changes to Sarah's
staff that Nina found both puzzling and relieving, at least at the beginning.&nbsp;
First, Franklin was gone.&nbsp; He hadn't made the transfer to the new
quarters, and now worked in a different department at the firm.&nbsp; "He
was a dear," Sarah said when explaining this, "but he made some of my clients
nervous.&nbsp; I thought this would give me an opportunity for a clean
sweep, a chance to shape this place the way I want it shaped.&nbsp; But
don't worry, he isn't completely gone.&nbsp; He is our company liaison
and will be coming by at least once a day.&nbsp; We will also use him on
any big jobs we might have."
<p>Nina could only sigh, but she was glad he wouldn't be around all the
time.
<p>The other change was the second lawyer, something forced on Sara at
the last second.&nbsp; "You can't run your department by yourself," she
was told.&nbsp; "We would be more comfortable if you had a second hand
on the tiller.&nbsp; What if something happened to you?&nbsp; We need someone
who will be familiar with your case load and to your clients!"
<p>At first, Sarah tried to argue against this, but she saw the way the
wind was blowing and changed tactics.&nbsp; "Fine," she said, "but I pick
him!"
<p>They agreed, which was how Donald Bell wound up on the team.&nbsp; Plucked
from his safe haven in 'Contract Law', he found himself with a day's notice
to move to the new location of 'Specialized Affairs'.&nbsp; Never really
having worked with Sarah Wickland before, his first day on the job started
out with a bang!
<p>They were in the new conference room, Donny and Sarah.&nbsp; The girls
were upstairs unloading and shelving law books into their library, so the
lawyers were alone.&nbsp; Never one to hesitate unless hesitation was more
beneficial, Sarah went straight for the jugular.
<p>"See this?" were her first words to her new team member, waving a videotape
in the air.
<p>"I see it," replied Donny, wondering what she was on about.&nbsp; He
soon found out.&nbsp; On the conference room TV, Donny watched a copy of
the security video of the night Nina had been running around the offices
of the firm in the nude.&nbsp; Heavily edited yet clearly time coded, what
he saw plainly showed the nude young woman sneaking into his office and
the subsequent entry of Mel, the security guard.&nbsp; After which, it
showed Nina leaving again.&nbsp; Donny tugged at his stiff collar.
<p>There was a slap of paper on the table in front of him.&nbsp; "Read
it," Sarah ordered.&nbsp; Donny read it.&nbsp; It was a notarized statement
given by Mel about what he had seen and heard in Donny's office that night.&nbsp;
Donny's denial that Nina was there and Mel's observation of Nina's toes
under the desk and the obvious way she would have HAD to have been positioned
for the toes to line up the way they did.
<p>Combined with the video it put Donald Bell in a very bad light and he
knew it!&nbsp; He couldn't think.&nbsp; "This means nothing," he blabbered.
<p>"Oh...Nothing!" said the Legallady, an apologetic look on her face.&nbsp;
"Then I expect that you wouldn't mind my sending these to your wife, or
your father-in-law, who happens to be one of my fellow partners!"
<p>"NO!"&nbsp; Donny yelled.&nbsp; "Wait...don't do that.&nbsp; There's
no need for that."
<p>"But if it's NOTHING!" teased Sarah.
<p>"It IS nothing.&nbsp; I mean...it's not what you think!&nbsp; I know
how it appears, but it wasn't like that!"
<p>Sarah picked up Mel's transcript and looked through it, her best trial
face on as she paced the room.&nbsp; "It looks like something to me!"
<p>"She just came in to hide," he said to her.
<p>"To hide?&nbsp; Naked?"
<p>Donny blushed.&nbsp; "Yes, naked.&nbsp; I don't know why she was naked."
<p>Sarah sniggered.&nbsp; "I bet."
<p>Donny was angry, but he was also scared.&nbsp; He knew of the Legallady
more by reputation than anything else, and her reputation was for being
ruthless.&nbsp; He was in a corner and knew it.&nbsp; Who on Earth would
believe HIS story when their own minds would conjure up the more sordid
version with very little help.&nbsp; "Why don't you ask her?"
<p>Sarah grinned.&nbsp; "Why should I?&nbsp; I so much prefer the more
obvious explanation!"
<p>"What do you want?" he asked her, sighing.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Good man, you get right to the point.&nbsp; I'm
showing you this because I want to make one thing clear to you.&nbsp; I'M
the boss!&nbsp; What I say goes, and what I want is usually a bit more
than is normal for your regular law office.&nbsp; I handle things my way
and you are not going to interfere.&nbsp; Understood?"
<p>Donny nodded.
<p>Sarah smiled again.&nbsp; "You might even come to enjoy some of the...perks...of
my department, and this is a very unusual department.&nbsp; I know you've
probably heard rumors of the kinds of clients I deal with.&nbsp; The kooks,
the weirdos, the perverts...etc.&nbsp; Well, I can honestly say that for
the most part they're true.&nbsp; My clients-OUR clients-are those who
don't toe the line, socially speaking.&nbsp; They are rich enough, or brave
enough, to live their own lifestyles rather than society's.&nbsp; You will
meet people for whom the word 'Fetish' is not a remote concept but a way
of being.&nbsp; Our job is simply to deal with their legal needs, nothing
more.&nbsp; We are NOT here to judge them.&nbsp; We are NOT here to look
down on them.&nbsp; We are NOT going to consider them any less deserving
of the BEST help we can give them simply because we find them weird!&nbsp;
And they will be weird, although they are also very normal, regular people
with the same problems other people have.&nbsp; I have one couple in a
property dispute with a neighbor over a garden fence.&nbsp; Normal, right?&nbsp;
Except this couple likes to sleep in coffins in the basement of their house
and only come out when it's dark.&nbsp; I'm doing a will for a family of
nudists, I'm sorting out a copyright violation for a songwriter who also
likes to cross-dress, I'm suing a church based on nudity, and STILL dealing
with a case ALLOWING schoolgirls to be punished with public nudity.&nbsp;
Yes, it's going to get weird around here."&nbsp; Sarah sat down across
the conference table from the shocked man.
<p>"Donny...may I call you Donny?&nbsp; Donny, what I want for this place
is for these people to be comfortable, for them to know that they can express
their fetish or whatever without fear of derision or judgment.&nbsp; If
a husband wants to bring his wife here in chains-fine!&nbsp; We'll provide
a place for him to chain her to while we do business.&nbsp; If a client
wants to relax by taking his or her clothes off-fine!&nbsp; We'll make
sure their clothes don't get wrinkled while they aren't being worn.&nbsp;
Do you understand what I'm trying to build here?&nbsp; It's trust.&nbsp;
Trust.&nbsp; When Brian Cook turned his clients over to me, he told me
that to keep them I would have to earn their trust, and once I did so,
they would be the most loyal clients in the world.&nbsp; I've found that
to be true, and their trust in me has earned the firm a whole lot of money
because these people for the most part are LOADED!"&nbsp; She stood up
and began to pace again.&nbsp; She smiled.
<p>"Not to say that I'm being a hypocrite, making nice to these folk while
living my normal life at home.&nbsp; You could say I have a great deal
in common with our clientele, as does another member of our team."&nbsp;
Sarah moved to an intercom on the wall and pushed a button.&nbsp; "Nina,
can you come down to the conference room please."
<p>"Right away, Sarah," Nina's voice replied.
<p>Sarah waited patiently and a moment later Nina, dressed in casual clothing
due to the moving they had yet to finish, practically skipped into the
room.&nbsp; "Yes, Sarah?"
<p>"You remember Donald Bell, don't you, dear?"
<p>Nina flushed and turned to the lawyer.&nbsp; "Sure...Hi."
<p>"Hello, Nina," said Donny, wondering what was coming.
<p>"It's official, Nina," Sarah said.&nbsp; "Donald is working with us
now.&nbsp; You'll be my girl Friday while Helen works with him."
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "That'll be wonderful."
<p>Sarah smiled that special smile.&nbsp; "There's just one more thing
I need to brief Donald on, dear.&nbsp; Your dress code."
<p>Nina's relief at Donald Bell working there quickly faded, as did the
color in her face.&nbsp; "But..." she said.
<p>"Now, Nina, did you really think things would change all that much.&nbsp;
I TOLD you we were going to have fun here."
<p>"I can't...WE can't...not in front of him!" Nina began to plead.
<p>Sarah began to laugh.&nbsp; "It's not like he hasn't seen you naked
before, Nina."
<p>"I know.&nbsp; But..." said the dismayed girl.
<p>Donny spoke up.&nbsp; "Wait, I don't understand."
<p>"It's very simple, Donald.&nbsp; Nina has a simple dress code when working
with me.&nbsp; She has to be nude."
<p>"Nude," repeated Donny, looking at the very red young woman.&nbsp; "All
the time?"
<p>"Well, before it was just when in my suite of offices, although she
did go for a walk once or twice," Sarah said with a sly smile.&nbsp; "But
now, as the entire building is ours, I don't see a need for her to have
to wear anything anywhere in it!"
<p>"Please," Nina said, not wanting to strip again.
<p>"But what abut clients?"&nbsp; Donny asked.
<p>Sarah turned toward him.&nbsp; "Weren't you listening when I was telling
you that we had to make our clients comfortable?&nbsp; One of the best
ways to put them at ease is to show them that we are the same as them.&nbsp;
Certainly having a nudist paralegal on the premises will help in that regard;
in fact it already has."
<p>"It has?"
<p>"Why certainly.&nbsp; Nina has gone nude for clients a number of times
already, and they are very impressed, by the way."
<p>Donny sat back and tried to absorb this.
<p>"Now, Nina, what are you waiting for," Sarah said.&nbsp; "It's time
you got undressed."
<p>Nina looked desperately from Sarah to Donny, seeing smug satisfaction
on the former and confused interest on the latter.&nbsp; Resigned, Nina
began to pull off her T-shirt.
<p>Donny watched as the beautiful young woman slowly took her clothes off,
casting off her sneakers, slipping off her tight jeans, and after hesitating
a moment, undoing her bra and pulling off her panties.&nbsp; Now she stood
nude before them, the clothes in a pile on the conference table.
<p>"I had some lockers installed by the back door," Sarah said.&nbsp; "Go
put your clothes in one of them, lock it, and bring me the key.&nbsp; This
will be your emergency set of clothes, in case you HAVE to have them.&nbsp;
Understood?"
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Nina said, reaching for the bundle and hating every second
of this.
<p>"Wait.&nbsp; One more thing.&nbsp; Seeing as there is no need for you
to wear clothing here at all, there is no need for you to dress coming
to and from work unless I tell you otherwise.&nbsp; So from now on, you
make the trip nude, both ways."
<p>Nina was flabbergasted.&nbsp; "Sarah, you're not serious!"
<p>"I'm very serious," said the Legallady.&nbsp; "Do I have to resort to
further measures?"
<p>Nina stared at her for a moment, then shook her head.
<p>"Very good," said Sarah.&nbsp; "Oh, I almost forgot.&nbsp; Tomorrow,
bring an outfit suitable for court; you can keep that here as well.&nbsp;
But remember, don't wear it."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am."
<p>"You're excused."
<p>Nina grabbed her clothes and disappeared as fast as she could.&nbsp;
Sarah turned and looked sternly at Donny.&nbsp; "I maintain discipline
here, and nudity is a fine control for both our paralegals, although Helen
is a much more sensitive case.&nbsp; Are you going to do anything about
this?"
<p>Donny swallowed.&nbsp; All he could think about was the image of Nina,
nude all the time here at work, and how his wife was going to kill him
if she found out.&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; "No, Ma'am.&nbsp; I'm
not going to say a word.&nbsp; You can count on me."
<p>Sarah walked around to face him, placing a long-nailed finger under
his chin.&nbsp; "That's very good Donny, because if I had to, I'd make
you strip as well.&nbsp; Got that?"
<p>"I got it," was his shaky reply.
<p>Sarah smiled.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>That night, while his wife was in bed sleeping, a restless Donny Bell
snuck downstairs to his den.&nbsp; Turning on his computer, he clicked
over to where he had hidden some directories from his nosy wife, and pulled
up a few image files.
<p>As he gazed at the pictures of bound, nude women, he thought about what
Sarah had told him, about how people of all kinds of fetish were clients
of the firm and how they would all be coming to see THEM!&nbsp; The prospect
of finally meeting someone like the pictures he kept hidden from his wife,
was very appealing, as was the discipline she instilled in Nina and Helen.
<p>Yes, Donny would not say a word about it to anyone.&nbsp; Not a word.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 25.

<br>
<p>Part 26, Payday.
<p>Payday for most people is usually a good day, and for Nina West this
was very true.&nbsp; Generally not a greedy person, she still liked receiving
that envelope every two weeks, and visions of her next shopping trip danced
behind her eyes.
<p>Nina had a routine for payday.&nbsp; She would head out on her lunch
hour to her bank, where she would deposit her check into her growing account,
before spoiling herself with a lavish, fattening meal.&nbsp; Most often,
she would do this with Helen, but even alone she enjoyed the ritual.
<p>Things were somewhat different now.&nbsp; Working in the new offices
meant a change of routine, because for starters, she had no clothes to
wear for that walk to the bank, and she wasn't about to do it nude.&nbsp;
Nina stared at her check and sighed.
<p>"What's wrong?" Helen asked, sipping at a cup of coffee and looking
over at her naked friend.&nbsp; The two women were sitting in the break
room, each looking at their newly earned fortunes.
<p>"How am I supposed to get to the bank today?" said Nina.
<p>Helen smiled a soft smile.&nbsp; "It's only two blocks away now, I would
have thought it would be easier!"
<p>"Ha, ha.&nbsp; Very funny!"&nbsp; Nina replied.
<p>Helen grinned.&nbsp; When Helen had first heard about Nina's new dress
code here at the new offices, she had been shocked and quite honestly scared.&nbsp;
Helen had expected at any time to be told the same thing by their boss,
but it hadn't happened.&nbsp; Sarah DID tell Helen, rather quietly, that
she wasn't completely immune to being stripped, but she was to keep herself
presentable as per the NORMAL firm dress code.
<p>Helen was very relieved, especially with Donald Bell working with them.&nbsp;
He was a nice man and Helen did NOT want to strip in front of him.&nbsp;
How Nina managed was beyond her.
<p>But as the last few days went by, Helen grew somewhat amused by poor
Nina's situation.&nbsp; In the morning, Helen would drive by Nina's to
find her waiting at the front gate, partially hidden from traffic.&nbsp;
Nina would then make a brave run, quite nude, across to Helen's car, jumping
in before anyone could see her.&nbsp; She would then slouch down and try
to hide from the rest of the morning traffic as Helen drove them to work.&nbsp;
In the evening, it was the same thing in the opposite order.&nbsp; Helen
was concerned that Nina had to go through all this, but also relished the
time she had to spend with her nude friend.&nbsp; She really was beautiful.
<p>"I could take your check in for you," Helen said.
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; It wasn't that she didn't trust Helen to do it;
she just enjoyed the ritual of doing it herself.&nbsp; "No, thanks.&nbsp;
But I'm going to go talk to Sarah; maybe she'll let me go do it myself."
<p>"I wouldn't count on it," Helen said, standing up and heading back to
her desk.
<p>Nina didn't hold out much hope either.&nbsp; Still, she made her way
upstairs to Sarah's office and knocked on the door.
<p>"Come!" said a voice from inside, and Nina entered her boss's sanctum.
<p>Sarah Wickland had decorated her office to look much like her old one
at the firm, although being smaller it lacked the cozy living room set
the old office had.&nbsp; THAT furniture was out on the landing in front
of the law library.
<p>Sarah was at her desk reading some papers and looked up with a smile
at the entry of her nude paralegal.&nbsp; "Yes, Nina.&nbsp; What can I
do for you?"
<p>"Hi, Sarah.&nbsp; It's about my check.&nbsp; You know I usually go out
at lunch to deposit it.&nbsp; Well..."
<p>Sarah leaned back in her chair.&nbsp; "I understand.&nbsp; You can't
exactly go out in your present condition, can you?"
<p>Nina shook her head.
<p>"Your bank is only a couple of blocks away, I think you could make it
if you tried!" Sarah chuckled.
<p>"Sarah!&nbsp; You WOULDN'T!" cried out Nina.
<p>Sarah laughed.&nbsp; "Maybe someday I just might.&nbsp; But not today.&nbsp;
Is it important you do it now; can't it wait until you are able to go?"
<p>Nina shrugged.&nbsp; "I guess I can wait, it's just that I usually did
it now.&nbsp; Could I please have something to wear so I can go?"
<p>Sarah stared at her for a moment before getting up.&nbsp; She walked
over to her closet and unlocked it (no unsecured clothing allowed in the
building by her order), taking out a coat and a pair of heels.&nbsp; "Here,
you can wear these."
<p>"Sarah, I can't go to my bank wearing nothing but a coat!"
<p>"Would you rather go naked?" Sarah asked her.
<p>Nina bit her lip.&nbsp; "No, I wouldn't."
<p>"Well if you want to go now, this is how you dress, your choice."
<p>Nina sighed and reached for the coat and shoes.&nbsp; She was surprised
to see they were her size.&nbsp; "Thank you."
<p>"Don't mention it, enjoy your lunch!"
<p>Nina left carrying the coat and shoes; she knew she wasn't to put them
on until the last minute.&nbsp; She went back downstairs to Helen's office
area.&nbsp; "The Legallady came through, somewhat," she said, showing her
friend what she had been given to wear.
<p>Helen tried to suppress a chuckle, although a smile broke through.&nbsp;
"Gee, I haven't seen you that dressed up in a while!"
<p>Nina couldn't help smiling herself as she saw the humor in her situation.&nbsp;
At least she had SOMETHING to wear, and with luck, no one would be the
wiser.&nbsp; "Care to come along, moral support?"
<p>"Sorry Nina, I HAVE to get this report typed up for Mr. Bell.&nbsp;
Rain check?"
<p>"Sure, rain check.&nbsp; How about I bring you something back to eat
and we can eat here."
<p>"Sounds good," Helen said, picking up her coffee cup and sipping at
it.&nbsp; She watched her friend walk out to the front of the office, slip
on her coat and high heels, and pause for a moment before leaving the building.&nbsp;
Through the floor to ceiling tinted glass windows, Helen could watch Nina
walk nervously across the parking lot and on toward her bank.&nbsp; Helen
chuckled and put down her mug, not looking where she was placing it.
<p>"OHSHIT!" she exclaimed as the mug hit her stapler and went sideways.&nbsp;
The dark brew inside spilled right across her desk, soaking the paperwork
she had placed there, the paperwork she and Donald Bell had been working
on for the last three days.
<p>"OHMYGOD, OHMYGOD!" cried the girl as she tried to pull documents out
from under the mess, but it was too late for most of them.&nbsp; In a panic,
Helen turned to run to the break room for a towel and saw Donny standing
on the stairs watching her.&nbsp; He looked pissed.
<p>"What the hell have you done?" he said loudly.
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.&nbsp; I spilled my coffee.&nbsp; I need to clean
it up!" Helen replied.
<p>"Damn right you do.&nbsp; Go get a rag!"
<p>Helen rushed back to the break room and Donny moved forward to see what
he could salvage.&nbsp; He saw that most of the paperwork simply needed
to be printed again, but several sheets were documented originals and not
easily replaced.
<p>"Stupid girl," he muttered, attempting to pick up the pieces.&nbsp;
Donny actually had a high opinion of Helen's work ethic and competence,
but he was a man who had little patience with stupidity.
<p>"What happened?" said a voice from above.
<p>Donny looked up to see Sarah leaning over the balcony of the level above
him.&nbsp; "Helen spilled coffee all over her desk," he said stiffly.
<p>"What was ruined?" Sarah asked.
<p>"Some interview notes from Cronenberg, a discovery list, various shit.&nbsp;
It'll put us back a couple of days, depending on how much Helen managed
to get transcribed into the computer."
<p>"Can you handle it?"
<p>"Of course I can handle it!" Donny said testily.
<p>"What about Helen?" Sarah asked.
<p>"What about her?&nbsp; She'll have to clean her desk before she can
use it again."
<p>Sarah sighed; it was a day for it.&nbsp; Helen suddenly appeared with
a few towels in her hands.&nbsp; "Oh man...I'm sorry.&nbsp; Let me wipe
it up!"
<p>"You shouldn't have coffee at your desk," Donny said, "that's what the
break room is for."
<p>"Sorry," Helen said, patting the soaked paperwork dry with a towel.
<p>"Now clean this mess up and see what you can salvage.&nbsp; Evidently
we're going to have to do some reconstruction later."
<p>"Yes, Sir," said a very nervous Helen.
<p>Donny was about to move away when Sarah stopped him; she had come down
the stairs with the intention of showing Donny how he SHOULD have handled
the situation.
<p>"Helen!" she said sharply, making the girl jump.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am?" Helen said, turning to see her boss.&nbsp; Helen didn't
like the expression on Sarah's face; she knew she was in for it.
<p>Sarah walked up to the desk and looked it over, most certainly a lot
of work needed to be redone.&nbsp; Sarah was pissed at the extra work,
but also glad for the opportunity to put pressure on Helen.&nbsp; Sarah
had a deal with Nina, and despite her reputation, Sarah never went back
on a deal.&nbsp; In exchange for Nina's special obedience, Sarah agreed
to lay off Helen, unless Helen brought her actions upon herself, as she
just did.
<p>"Helen, I'm very disappointed in you.&nbsp; I can't let this go without
impressing upon you how disappointed I am."
<p>Helen stood silently, scared.
<p>Sarah looked at her.&nbsp; "Considering that it was the Cronenberg case
you ruined here, I think your punishment is most apt.&nbsp; Remember that
weekend when I put you under Cronenberg rules so you could see what it
was like?&nbsp; Well, consider those rules renewed."
<p>"Please no," Helen whispered.
<p>"Oh yes, and not just for a couple of days.&nbsp; From now on, for as
long as you work in this department, you will work under Cronenberg rules.&nbsp;
You are responsible to both myself AND Donald, which means we both have
the authority to sentence you!"
<p>Helen looked from Sarah to Donny and back again.&nbsp; Both lawyers
looked angry, although Donny seemed a little taken aback as well.
<p>Sarah turned to him.&nbsp; "You are familiar with Cronenberg School's
rules of behavior, aren't you?" she asked him.
<p>Donny was.&nbsp; When he had been given the file a few days before,
he devoured the material on Cronenberg.&nbsp; It wasn't quite his cup of
tea, but close enough.&nbsp; Still, the thought of actually being able
to USE them!&nbsp; He nodded.
<p>Sarah raised an eyebrow before smiling and moving away.&nbsp; "I'll
leave her to you then, Donald.&nbsp; Let me know later what the total damage
to the file is."
<p>"Sure thing, Sarah," he said.&nbsp; He waited until Sarah started back
up the stairs before turning to face Helen.&nbsp; She looked very, very
nervous.&nbsp; She looked up at him, hope on her face.&nbsp; Donny's heart
was thumping furiously in his chest.&nbsp; Could he do this?
<p>"Helen...give me your blouse, please," he said, trying to hide the tremor
in his voice.
<p>"But...please, Sir!" Helen said, crossing her arms in front of her.
<p>"Your blouse, and your skirt.&nbsp; Another word of protest and I'll
ask for more!"
<p>Donny watched, wondering what Helen was going to do.&nbsp; He knew that
most women under the same circumstances would turn and walk out, in turn
suing the firm for sexual harassment.&nbsp; But he didn't think that was
going to happen here.&nbsp; He figured Sarah had something on both Helen
and Nina, like she had something on HIM.&nbsp; He didn't know what it could
be, but it had to be something big.
<p>Helen began to move.&nbsp; She slowly undid the buttons of her blouse,
pausing for a moment before slipping it off her soft shoulders.&nbsp; She
wore a tan, strapless bra underneath which gave her breasts some lift.&nbsp;
Helen then undid a clasp at her hip and pulled a zipper so she could step
out of her dress.&nbsp; Her panties were pink and quite respectable.&nbsp;
Shaking, Helen held out the two pieces of clothing and Donny took them.&nbsp;
He was amazed that Helen actually complied, and the possibilities echoed
through his head.&nbsp; He tried not to think about his wife and family
at home.&nbsp; "You get these back at close of business today.&nbsp; But
for the next three...no, five days, you work in your underwear only.&nbsp;
Got that?"
<p>"Yes, Mr. Bell," Helen said quietly.
<p>"Now clean that mess up.&nbsp; I want to know what we need to replace
so I can start making some calls."&nbsp; With that, he turned and went
back to his office, taking Helen's clothing with him.
<p>Helen sighed and went to work.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina made it to the bank without very much trouble, although she did
get a few strange looks from people wondering why she was wearing a coat
in such warm weather.&nbsp; Nina just smiled and hugged it tighter to herself.
<p>Now she stood in line, her check in her hand, waiting for her turn at
the window.&nbsp; As she stood there, she frowned.&nbsp; There was something
familiar about the figure in front of her.&nbsp; The figure turned to look
out a window.
<p>"YOU!" Nina exclaimed.
<p>"Oh!" said the blonde, instantly recognizing who was standing behind
her.
<p>"Jenny!" Nina said, horrified to see this dangerous woman in her present
condition.
<p>"Hi Nina.&nbsp; Look, I'm sorry about what happened at BAREASS!"
<p>"So you keep saying, Jenny," Nina replied, stepping back from the blonde.&nbsp;
The last time Nina had run into Jenny, she had ended up stuck up in a tree,
naked, with her and a guy on a motorcycle.&nbsp; It took over an hour before
they were rescued.
<p>"It's not my fault," said Jenny.&nbsp; "Sometimes these things just
happen!"
<p>Jenny had such a sorry look on her face, that Nina couldn't stay upset
with her.&nbsp; "It's okay, Jenny.&nbsp; You do have some bad luck sometimes,
but I guess it isn't really your fault."
<p>"Thanks Nina.&nbsp; I hate it when I get other people in trouble," she
said with a happy smile.
<p>Nina chuckled.&nbsp; "Well, that's not likely to happen today.&nbsp;
What could possibly happen in the middle of a bank?"
<p>There was a commotion at the door and a woman screamed.&nbsp; Several
men all dressed in black burst into the bank brandishing firearms.&nbsp;
"THIS IS A STICK UP!&nbsp; EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR!" one of them yelled.
<p>"Oh no," said Jenny, "not again!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The robbers sealed all the exits and started to strip all the customers
of their valuables, which apparently included their clothes.&nbsp; Nina
sighed and looked up at the ceiling, berating herself for not running as
soon as she saw it was Jenny she had been standing behind.
<p>When the robber in charge got to Nina, he saw there wasn't much for
her to remove.&nbsp; "Hey guys," he said to the others that weren't working
on the bank's vault, "this one's naked already under her coat!"
<p>"Sure is a beauty!" another said as Nina shrugged her coat off.&nbsp;
She blushed as the robbers and many of the customers took in her nude body.&nbsp;
The guy in charge took her coat and shoes away from her, including her
paycheck, and made her stand and show herself off.&nbsp; Nina thought she
might have been more humiliated than she felt, but she was used to being
gawked at by strangers now and felt more angry than scared.&nbsp; Like
the others before her, she was told to sit down again, and she eased her
bare butt down on the cold marble floor.
<p>"Now THIS one's stacked!" he said, pointing at Jenny.
<p>"Oh PLEASE, don't make me take my clothes off...PLEASE!" Jenny begged.&nbsp;
All it did was make the men laugh.
<p>"Come on, Honey, get those clothes off!" one of them told her, pointing
his rather large weapon in her direction.
<p>Jenny sighed and pulled at her thin sweater, tugging it up over her
head.&nbsp; It got stuck part way up with her head and arms trapped in
it, and the men were treated to Jenny jiggling around trying to get free,
her large breasts only barely contained by the flimsy bra she wore.
<p>So entranced by her dance were the robbers, that had a customer decided
to snatch a gun and take control of the situation, he could have done so
easily.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the customers were all watching Jenny as well.
<p>To their collective dismay, Jenny finally pulled her sweater off, but
to their collective satisfaction, she soon pulled off her tight pants and
started work on her bra.
<p>"Please?" she begged once more.
<p>"All of it," replied the robber.&nbsp; He was soon treated to the amazing
sight of Jenny topless, it almost made him forget the robbery.&nbsp; When
Jenny bent over to slide off her panties, his gun pointed straight up!
<p>He gathered her clothes and made her sit, and got on with stripping
the rest of the customers and employees, but it just wasn't the same and
his eyes kept drifting back to Jenny.
<p>Nina, watching how the men stared at Jenny, just shook her head and
sighed.
<p>"Alright," he said when the last one was stripped, "let's get them tied
up."
<p>Several men dug coils of rope out of their packs and began pairing off
the naked captives.&nbsp; The leader himself approached Jenny and Nina
and motioned them together back to back.
<p>"Oh please," Nina said, "could you tie me to someone else!"
<p>The man chuckled.&nbsp; "What are you, jealous?"
<p>Nina wasn't jealous; she just knew that being stuck to Jenny meant more
trouble for herself.&nbsp; But it didn't stop the robber from tying them
together, and when it was done Nina and Jenny were securely bound from
the waist up, back to back, their hands tied together far from any knots.&nbsp;
The leader took the opportunity to give Jenny and Nina a quick grope each,
before moving on to tie someone else.
<p>"The cops are showing up outside!" one of the other robbers said.&nbsp;
Through the glass front of the bank, police cars could clearly be seen
pulling up.
<p>"Get 'em to the windows!" yelled the leader, and the naked captives
were hauled to their feet and pushed toward the front of the building.&nbsp;
Aware that whoever ended up facing the window would be exposed to everyone
outside, many of the bound couples tried to turn to place the OTHER one
in that predicament.&nbsp; Nina, somewhat stronger than Jenny, managed
to do the same thing, and the helpless blonde found her large breasts pressed
against the glass at the end of the line of nude hostages.&nbsp; She of
course almost fainted with embarrassment at the sight of all the police
out front staring right at her.
<p>The police started yelling official type stuff on their loudspeakers,
and the leader of the robbers yelled back from the doorway from behind
the body of an attractive naked teller.&nbsp; It was all very confusing,
and Nina knew it couldn't end happily.&nbsp; When the robber yelled out
something about a bus for all the hostages and a plane to South America,
Nina knew she had to find a way out of this.&nbsp; She didn't want to fly
to another continent completely naked and tied to Jenny.
<p>Then, opportunity presented itself.&nbsp; During all this, there was
a team working on the vault, which the manager had managed to close and
lock the moment he saw the men with guns.&nbsp; This team had wired the
vault door to blow, and right at the height of the negotiations with the
police, they decided to blow it.
<p>They misjudged the charge, and the boom echoed through the building,
followed by a lot of smoke and ash.&nbsp; Nina noted that a robber who
had been guarding a side passage out of the lobby had come running at the
sound of the blast, leaving his post unmanned.
<p>"Come on!" Nina whispered, yanking on the ropes holding her to Jenny.
<p>Jenny was glad to be pulled away from the window; she had spotted some
media people setting up their cameras, but she was confused by the blast
and by Nina pulling on her.&nbsp; "What's going on?" she yelled, ears ringing.
<p>"This way, this way!" cried Nina, trying to pull Jenny toward the unguarded
exit.&nbsp; But Jenny was fighting her, not understanding Nina's intentions,
and generally acting like her blonde self.
<p>In frustration, Nina bent forward and actually lifted Jenny's feet from
the ground.&nbsp; Nina was strong due to her regular workouts, but she
knew she could only carry Jenny a little ways before her strength gave
out.&nbsp; She made a dash for the unguarded hallway and hoped the smoke
filling the building would mask their escape.
<p>It did for a few seconds, but one of the robbers spotted the fleeing
pair and gave chase.
<p>"Run, RUN!" yelled Jenny.
<p>Nina didn't have the breath to reply.&nbsp; She carried the naked Jenny
as fast as she could past some bathrooms toward a fire exit at the far
end of the hallway.
<p>"Stop, I'll shoot!" yelled the robber, but Nina didn't.&nbsp; She was
determined to win.
<p>Later, when interviewed by the police, the robber was asked why he didn't
fire.&nbsp; His response was that he just couldn't bring himself to shoot
at such hot naked chicks, especially the way Jenny's legs waved in the
air as Nina carried her.
<p>Nina, almost dying from the strain, hit the door running and it burst
open, triggering a siren.&nbsp; Amid the whooping, Nina ran out onto grass
that sloped down a hillside away from the bank.&nbsp; Unable to stop for
several yards, she kept on going, not looking at what was around her while
Jenny yelled at her to stop.
<p>Nina finally stopped and looked up, and almost died.&nbsp; She had run
right in front of where the media had set up, and cameras from local and
national news stations were suddenly focused on the nude duo.&nbsp; There
were even a few TV helicopters crowding the sky, cameramen leaning far
out into the air in order to capture on film the naked escapees.
<p>Nina squealed as flashes erupted from the banks of newspaper photographers
and she spun around so that Jenny faced them instead.&nbsp; She couldn't
hold the blonde up any longer though, and as soon as Jenny's feet touched
the ground, Jenny tried to turn Nina.&nbsp; As the two women fought to
hide from their exposure, the press circled round until there was NO place
to go.&nbsp; More footage was taken of the struggling females than of the
subsequent capture of the robbers shortly afterward.&nbsp; Certainly more
seconds were devoted to showing them on TV later that night than the robbers
got, although the video was carefully blurred in just the right spots for
family viewing.&nbsp; There were rumors of a bootleg video circling around,
but it was denied by all involved.
<p>No one made a move to cover or help the two women until the police got
there minutes later.
<p>A cop threw a blanket over both of them and led them behind police lines,
where the other hostages were being gathered now that the police had stormed
the bank.
<p>Paramedics were working on untying the hostages, and Jenny and Nina
had to wait patiently for their turn.&nbsp; Of course, their blanket slipped
off, leaving both girls helplessly nude once more.&nbsp; Activity all around
them actually ceased for a few brief seconds at the sight of Jenny and
Nina bound together, then a female paramedic rushed over and covered them
up again.&nbsp; Moments later, they were freed, and Nina took the opportunity
to get as far away from Jenny as she could.
<p>She was treated for rope burns, given a jump suit to wear, and interviewed
by a detective before being finally released and driven back to work.&nbsp;
By now, she was tired, angry, hurt, and humiliated at the prospect that
her naked body was going to be on the 6 o'clock news.
<p>"What happened to you?" said Helen, standing at her desk in just her
underwear.
<p>Nina looked at her and blinked.&nbsp; "What happened to you?" she asked
back.
<p>The tales were told in the break room...over coffee.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 27, Man &amp; Woman.
<p>Nina lay back in the sun on the soft pool lounger and sipped at her
daiquiri.&nbsp; With one hand she idly wiped a bead of sweat off her left
breast, and watched the water play over the fountain in the middle of the
pool.
<p>That's right, she wasn't at home, yet there she was lying naked by a
pool and more relaxed than she had felt in a long time.&nbsp; Her boss,
Sarah Wickland, had given her the rest of the week off to recover from
her fright during the bank robbery.&nbsp; It had been an unexpected move
on Sarah's part, and Nina took her up on it without any hesitation.&nbsp;
To be honest, Nina didn't feel that she needed the break, but was glad
to have it anyway.
<p>She had planned to spend time at home this day, with maybe a trip to
the beach, but she got a call from Yvette Barb, Jim's mother, who invited
her over for the day.
<p>"Please come," said the French woman, "we talked so little last time
you were here, and I want to get to know the woman my son talks about!"
<p>Nina didn't quite know what to say, but she could hear the enthusiasm
in Yvette's voice and felt a stir of curiosity herself.&nbsp; So off Nina
went, clothed this time, to talk to her boyfriend's mother.
<p>Yvette was a charming hostess and had no trouble putting Nina at ease.&nbsp;
She had an infectious lust for life that got Nina smiling almost from the
beginning.
<p>Yvette gave Nina a more comprehensive tour of the gallery, telling sordid
but entertaining tales about some of the artists, especially some of the
ones for whom she had posed.&nbsp; Nina at first found it hard to regard
the nude paintings and other art of the woman beside her with any ease,
it was odd to her to be invited to see nude pictures of her boyfriend's
mother.&nbsp; But as time went on, Nina was able to adjust, especially
since Yvette made no big deal of her nudity in the pictures.&nbsp; She
was just another model.&nbsp; At least she was dressed at the moment, in
another of the loose gowns she wore the first time Nina had met her.&nbsp;
Nina wondered if the woman was naked underneath.&nbsp; Nina herself was
in shorts and a T-shirt, for it was a warm day.
<p>Yvette was very knowledgeable about art in general, and Nina found her
stories fascinating.&nbsp; Yvette was just finishing up a story about a
young artist who wanted to bed her between sittings, when the couple made
their way out to the back of the house where Nina saw the most amazing
pool.&nbsp; It was large and shaped like a bowl, with no straight sides.&nbsp;
In the middle was a fountain, and it made Nina stop and stare.&nbsp; The
fountain consisted of three figures, all nude.&nbsp; One was obviously
Yvette, her features well brought out in the stonework; she looked to be
in her late twenties.&nbsp; Another was a slightly older man, and Nina
saw that it was Tom Barb, Jim's father.&nbsp; He didn't look that comfortable
standing there nude in stone.&nbsp; The third was a young boy, maybe eight,
and Nina had to assume that it was Jim.&nbsp; The threesome was posed as
if for a family portrait, with Yvette seated on a rock, Tom standing next
to her, his hand on her shoulder, and little Jimmy crouched down beside
his mother, in front of his father's legs.&nbsp; The water sprayed from
behind them, acting as a backdrop.&nbsp; It was the most amazing family
portrait Nina had ever seen and it beat anything you would find at the
Sears Portrait Studio hands down!
<p>"You like, huh?" Yvette said, watching Nina with a smile.
<p>"It's incredible," Nina replied.&nbsp; "That IS Jim, isn't it?"
<p>Yvette laughed.&nbsp; "Yes, that is my little James; he is cute, huh?&nbsp;
He did not like to pose nude, my little James, but he did it for me and
now you can see him."&nbsp; Yvette gave Nina a sideways grin.&nbsp; "I
expect that seeing him au natural is nothing new to you!"
<p>Nina blushed while Yvette laughed.&nbsp; "Don't worry, ma ch&eacute;ri,
I know my James is a man of the world now, it is perfectly natural.&nbsp;
Besides, it is only fair, is it not!"
<p>Nina chuckled.&nbsp; "I guess it is; he's seen me naked enough!"
<p>"James is like my husband; for him it is never enough!"
<p>Nina had wanted to ask her about that; her stay last time had been cut
very short by the lateness of the hour and Nina hadn't had a chance to
ask Yvette about the statement she made concerning her own courtship with
Tom Barb.&nbsp; Had her husband really not seen her with clothes on until
almost before the wedding?
<p>Before she could ask though, Yvette began to slip off her dress.&nbsp;
She was nude underneath, and without a care draped the garment over a nearby
chair and picked a tube of sunscreen up off a patio table.&nbsp; She looked
up at Nina to see her watching her in surprise.&nbsp; "Oh, I'm sorry.&nbsp;
I'm so used to just undressing here I didn't think to ask.&nbsp; Do you
mind, cheri?"
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "No, not at all; it's your home after all."
<p>"Merci, ma cheri.&nbsp; I know you understand.&nbsp; To not wear clothes,
it is a freedom, it is natural."&nbsp; She began rubbing sun lotion onto
her skin.
<p>Nina had the oddest feeling right then, that her clothes were tightening
down on her.&nbsp; Being out in the sun, next to a pool, it felt wrong
to be dressed, and Nina had an urge to pull off what she was wearing.&nbsp;
At first she fought it, then wondered why.&nbsp; After all, it wasn't as
if Yvette hadn't already seen her nude, they had a nude statue of her outside
their front door so Yvette was very familiar with Nina's nude body already.
<p>"Er...Yvette?"&nbsp; Nina said.
<p>Yvette was lathering on lotion like it was an Olympic event, working
quickly and firmly to cover all her skin.&nbsp; She looked up.&nbsp; "Yes,
Nina?"
<p>"Would you mind if I...er..."
<p>Yvette smiled.&nbsp; "Why of course you may, ma cheri.&nbsp; I think
it would be a lovely idea.&nbsp; You look hot and uncomfortable in those
clothes."
<p>Nina smiled thanks and gingerly got undressed, leaving her clothing
on the same chair as Yvette's gown.&nbsp; Self-conscious, Nina took a few
steps and dove into the water.&nbsp; It was odd trying to swim in the round
pool, but she managed to porpoise around for a few minutes before pulling
herself back out.&nbsp; She felt better for her swim and more comfortable
in herself and her nudity.&nbsp; So she just stood and air-dried for a
few minutes, aware that Yvette was studying her.
<p>"You have a good body, not too skinny.&nbsp; Yes, I can see why they
all want to paint you," she said.
<p>"Er...thanks," Nina said with a smile.
<p>"But you have to look after it better.&nbsp; Here, so you don't burn!"&nbsp;
Yvette passed her the tube of lotion and went to lie in a lounger.&nbsp;
Nina dutifully applied lotion, enjoying as always the way it made her skin
feel.
<p>The two women continued to talk, and while they did so, a maid in somewhat
traditional apparel came out to see if they needed anything.&nbsp; Nina
felt very odd being served by a maid while lying nude in the sun, but that
was how she got her daiquiri.
<p>She and Yvette talked about Jim, and Nina laughed long and hard at the
embarrassing stories only a mother can tell about her son.&nbsp; They talked
about Yvette's life as a model and about how Tom courted and married her.&nbsp;
They talked about Nina and her family, and how none of them respected her
decision to come out here and be a lawyer.&nbsp; They also talked about
Alex West, Nina's grandfather, who Nina was surprised to see Yvette had
known.
<p>All in all, it was one of the most relaxing mornings Nina had ever had,
and Nina's affection for Yvette grew.&nbsp; She wished her own mother was
this open and this alive, and a part of her was jealous of Jim for having
such a woman as a mother.&nbsp; What a childhood he must have had.
<p>They lunched on the terrace, seated at one of the glass-topped tables.&nbsp;
A wonderful crab salad with a sparkling wine, and the two nude females
chatted like old friends.&nbsp; Only occasionally did Nina step back in
her mind and think 'Wow, I'm sitting here naked with my boyfriend's MOTHER!',
but those thoughts came farther and father apart.
<p>It was then that Nina managed to broach the subject of Tom not wanting
to see Yvette in clothes, and Nina shyly admitted that Jim was the same
way about her.
<p>"Ah!&nbsp; Like father, like son.&nbsp; Cheri, those two are a lot alike,
and it can only mean good for you, no?" Yvette chuckled.
<p>"You said he hates seeing you in clothes even now, is that true?" Nina
asked.
<p>Yvette nodded.&nbsp; "Oh yes, I rarely dress for him anymore.&nbsp;
Oh, the lengths that man would go to in order to keep me naked.&nbsp; Once,
we took a trip around the world, while James was in school.&nbsp; We sailed,
a big private yacht.&nbsp; On land, when seeing the sights I was allowed
to dress with as little as was legal, but on the water, nothing at all!&nbsp;
The crew was all thumbs the first week we were at sea.&nbsp; But the sparkle
in his eye, the SEX!&nbsp; Oh, it is worth it!&nbsp; Do you not find it
so?"
<p>Nina began to blush again and Yvette laughed.&nbsp; "Oh, little one,
you blush so well when talk comes to sex, it must mean that my little James
is a good lover, no?&nbsp; You need not be ashamed, Nina."
<p>Nina couldn't help giggling.&nbsp; "It's just that...well, I never thought
I'd be talking about sex with the mother of the man I'm seeing!" she said.
<p>"Sex is also a freedom, ma cheri, and good sex can make you fly!&nbsp;
But good sex only comes if there is love."&nbsp; She eyed the young woman,
who blushed even more.&nbsp; "Ah...it is as I thought.&nbsp; You love my
little James, do you not?"
<p>Nina looked down, unable to voice her feelings.
<p>Yvette smiled a warm, motherly smile.&nbsp; "He too feels love for you,
ma cheri.&nbsp; He never speaks of it, but he feels it.&nbsp; I can see
it in his eyes as he says your name."
<p>Nina looked up.&nbsp; She had an inkling that Jim loved her...well much
more than an inkling, but he had yet to say the words.
<p>Yvette leaned forward, almost dipping a nipple in her salad.&nbsp; "Let
me tell you a little secret, Cheri," she said.
<p>"No secrets, Mother!" said a male voice from the back of the house,
and the two women turned to see Jim standing in the French doors watching
them.
<p>Nina broke into a smile.&nbsp; "Hi Jim!"
<p>Jim was grinning as well, and he walked out to meet them.&nbsp; He gave
his mother a quick kiss on the cheek first, then gave Nina a longer one
on the lips, slipping his hands over her body and making her shiver.
<p>Yvette smiled a knowing smile and watched the young lovers.
<p>"So what are you two ladies talking about?" he asked, pulling up another
seat and helping himself to some crab salad and wine.&nbsp; "Secrets?"
<p>"Yvette was just telling me about your childhood.&nbsp; My, what a naughty
boy!" she said with a giggle.
<p>"Nonsense.&nbsp; I was the model of good behavior," he said with a smirk.
<p>"Oh!&nbsp; Is that why you almost set the house on fire setting off
fireworks in your room?"&nbsp; Nina said with a laugh.
<p>Jim gave her a playful scowl.&nbsp; "Be careful, Wench, that's my image
you're toying with."
<p>Nina laughed.
<p>The three of them chatted some more while they finished lunch, the two
women completely nude while Jim was dressed in shorts and a shirt.&nbsp;
There was no sign of any self-consciousness among any of them, and Nina
was having a good time.
<p>Jim asked her about the robbery.&nbsp; They had talked over the phone
the night before, but he was still concerned about her.&nbsp; Nina assured
them that she was fine and was about to give them an account, when the
maid came out with an announcement.
<p>"Madam, Boris Berednov to see you?"
<p>"Boris, that is wonderful!" Yvette exclaimed.&nbsp; "Bring him out here,
he must come!"
<p>Nina suddenly felt uncomfortable, sitting in a patio chair with nothing
on.&nbsp; But then she remembered that Berednov had already seen her nude
several times.&nbsp; As one of Brian's artist friends, he had shown up
for several of Brian's parties.&nbsp; Not to mention that time she met
him at Buffalo Beach.
<p>"YVETTE!" boomed a voice from inside the house, and a second later the
Russian emerged.&nbsp; He was dressed in tattered jeans and a shirt that
looked like it had been used as an artist's palette at one point.&nbsp;
He was still an impressive man, looking more like Mel Gibson than ever.
<p>"Beard!" Yvette said, calling him by his nickname as she got up from
the table and went to him.&nbsp; The two of them hugged, and Nina looked
to Jim for his response to seeing his nude mother hug a man not her husband.&nbsp;
Jim didn't look upset by it at all.&nbsp; In fact, he turned to whisper
something to Nina.&nbsp; "Do you know Beard?" he asked.&nbsp; "He and Mom
go way back to Paris where he was an art student.&nbsp; She sponsored his
immigration to the States."
<p>"We've met a few times," Nina whispered back.
<p>Beard put Yvette down and looked over at Nina.&nbsp; "Ah, there she
is!&nbsp; Nina, I come for you!"
<p>Nina was a little confused.&nbsp; "For me?"
<p>"Yes, young Nina.&nbsp; Today, I paint you!&nbsp; Boris, I said to myself
this morning, Boris, today you paint Nina West!&nbsp; I go to your home
and Brian says you are here.&nbsp; Now that I have found you, we can begin."
<p>Nina laughed.&nbsp; "You can't really mean that."
<p>Jim spoke up.&nbsp; "I think it's a nice idea, you should do it."
<p>"Certainly she should do it," Yvette added, coming over and picking
up her wine glass.&nbsp; "To be painted by Berednov is a great honor!"
<p>Nina was beginning to blush at the attention.&nbsp; "I don't know if
I could model for him."
<p>Jim stood up and helped Nina to her feet.&nbsp; "Sure you can," he said,
and he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her gently, his warm lips
holding her still.
<p>Nina had her eyes closed during the kiss, and when he pulled away, she
kept them closed for a moment.&nbsp; "If you kiss me again like that, I'll
do anything," she said with a smile.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "Be careful who you say that to.&nbsp; You KNOW
I would take you up on it."
<p>Nina began to blush furiously, then she melted a little as Jim kissed
her again.&nbsp; When he pulled away that time, Nina was flushed from more
than the kiss, aroused by his closeness.&nbsp; Her state was noticed by
both Beard and Yvette who stood smiling together.
<p>Then Beard flapped his arms.&nbsp; "I have changed my mind.&nbsp; I
will not be painting young Nina today."
<p>"What?" said the other three almost in unison.
<p>"Today, I paint Nina AND James here.&nbsp; Together!"
<p>Now it was Jim's turn to blush.&nbsp; "That's okay, Beard.&nbsp; You
don't have to paint me."
<p>"I insist.&nbsp; Yvette, are they not a very attractive couple?"
<p>"They are most attractive," Jim's mother said with an easy smile.&nbsp;
"And after you have painted them, I will buy it!"
<p>"Mom!" Jim said.
<p>"It is settled," said Beard.&nbsp; "James, my paints and a canvas are
in my car.&nbsp; You come help, please?"
<p>Jim looked from his mother to the artist and back again, then at Nina.&nbsp;
"Do you want this?" he asked her.
<p>Nina's eyes were dancing.&nbsp; "I'd love it.&nbsp; Please say yes!"
<p>Jim sighed, but Nina could see he was also excited by the idea.&nbsp;
"Alright, for you."&nbsp; He gave her a quick kiss on the nose and left
to go help Beard with his stuff.
<p>Beard had more than paints and a canvas in his car.&nbsp; He and Jim
hauled in several items, which unfolded into reflective screens of the
sort that photographers used.&nbsp; Beard set them up near one of the boulders
just beyond the pool that were part of the landscaping of the grounds,
before turning to his subjects.
<p>"Nina," he said, "you look perfect, but we need your man to also look
his best.&nbsp; James, take off your clothes!"
<p>"What?&nbsp; I'm not doing this naked," said Jim with a smile.
<p>"Don't be silly," said his mother, "you must.&nbsp; You are being painted
by Berednov, do as he says!"
<p>"But Mom!" Jim began, and Yvette gave him a stern look that shut him
up.
<p>Nina sidled up to him.&nbsp; "Come on Jim, it'll be fine.&nbsp; I'd
like it if we were nude together for a while."&nbsp; She suddenly blushed
a little after realizing what she had just said in front of his mother,
and figured the wine had loosened her tongue a little.&nbsp; Still she
did mean it, and deliberately stood in a way to make Jim take an extra
look at her.&nbsp; She thought of it as her power nude pose, right hand
on hip, hip pushed out to the right.
<p>Jim shook his head and smiled.&nbsp; "Okay."&nbsp; He pulled off his
shirt, and after a moment of stalling, took off his shorts and boxers.&nbsp;
Nude, he felt rather self-conscious and tried to keep his thoughts clean
as he looked at his gorgeous girlfriend.
<p>Happy, Beard herded his two young models over to the boulder he had
chosen for their pedestal, and proceeded to position them.&nbsp; He had
them sit facing each other, legs mingling, almost in each other's laps.&nbsp;
Nina's legs were outside Jim's, opening her up both to his gaze and to
Beard's.&nbsp; Jim grinned, but Beard hardly reacted, intent on creating
the pose he wanted.&nbsp; He messed with their legs a little longer until
he had them just right.&nbsp; Jim's visible leg was low and supporting
his weight, while Nina's visible leg was up and bent at the knee, half
hiding Jim's crotch.&nbsp; Beard wasn't the type of artist who explicitly
displayed private parts, so he arranged them so that while there was no
doubt they were nude, they were also hidden as well.&nbsp; The couple's
other legs were tucked up under their butts, lifting them a little.
<p>Their hands he messed with quite a bit before finally settling.&nbsp;
Nina had her visible arm curved up, holding the back of his shoulder, while
his visible arm was down on her thigh, right against her hip.&nbsp; His
other hand Beard placed on the back of Nina's head, drawing her to him
in a kiss, which was how he arranged their heads.&nbsp; Nina's face would
be visible; Jim's not so much.&nbsp; Nina's free hand he simply placed
on Jim's hidden thigh, and she slid it forward until it met his groin to
help support herself.&nbsp; The total effect was of a young couple, nude
together, leaning in to each other for a kiss.
<p>"Very nice," Beard said, looking at it from several angles before finally
planting his tripod and canvas.&nbsp; He messed with the reflectors until
the light was as he wanted it, and then set out to sketch on the canvas.
<p>"Comfortable?" he yelled, Yvette looking over his shoulder as he captured
the image in charcoal.
<p>"No!" yelled both Jim and Nina, breaking their kiss to do so.
<p>"Too bad, don't move!" laughed the Russian, and everybody smiled.
<p>Nina had been instructed to keep her eyes closed and she tried, but
occasionally she would open them, to see Jim's eyes only inches away.&nbsp;
She could see his mother in his smile, and smiled back.&nbsp; Jim would
then put some warmth into the kiss, to which Nina enthusiastically responded.
<p>She could feel his hand on her thigh, his fingers spread wide to cover
the most skin.&nbsp; She had no idea his thumb was where it was, though,
until he moved it and brushed her pussy lips.&nbsp; Nina jumped and almost
broke position, her eyes wide with shock.&nbsp; Jim chuckled and tried
to look innocent, so she narrowed her eyes at him.&nbsp; He moved his thumb
again.
<p>He didn't stop, allowing his thumb to slowly caress her intimate spot,
making Nina jump and shiver.
<p>"Quite fidgeting!" ordered Beard.
<p>Nina would have liked to, she was getting very aroused both by the movement
of Jim's thumb and the intimate position they were in.
<p>"Stop that," she tried to whisper with the minimum of mouth movement.
<p>"Stop what?" Jim said with an evil smile in his eyes.&nbsp; He began
to push the tip of his thumb into her.
<p>Nina shuddered and shifted slightly, moving the hand hidden on Jim's
thigh.&nbsp; It bumped something.&nbsp; Nina glanced down.
<p>Jim was half erect and now within reach of her hand.
<p>Nina smiled.
<p>Moving carefully, she slid her hand over until it could grasp Jim's
manhood.&nbsp; Any second Nina expected Beard to order her back into position,
but evidently, her movements were masked by her leg.&nbsp; So she was able
to grasp him and even tickle his balls if she wished.
<p>NOW Jim's eyes were open wide, the smile gone.&nbsp; In its place was
a look of mild panic, and she could feel him grow harder in her hand.
<p>"No!" Jim said to her.
<p>"No, what?" Nina whispered back, her thumb teasing his cock head.&nbsp;
She raked her fingernails lightly up and down and fondled him gently, enjoying
the fact that the worm had now turned.&nbsp; Jim still tried to fondle
her, but there was little a single thumb could do and he couldn't really
concentrate any longer.&nbsp; Besides, she had her whole hand to work with.
<p>She continued to play with Jim, getting him so hard that she could feel
his pulse at the base of his dick.&nbsp; His breathing was growing shorter
and he had a glazed look to his eyes when she peeked to look at them.&nbsp;
He was also gripping the back of her head tighter and had just about given
up trying to rub her sweet spot with his thumb.&nbsp; His kissing grew
more passionate though, and that was all Nina needed for her own heat to
rise.&nbsp; She was still aware that they were in full view of Beard and
Jim's mother, but another part of her didn't care as she responded to his
kiss.&nbsp; Their mouths opened and tongues met.
<p>Nina had been running a nail along the underside of Jim's penis, stroking
it to iron hardness and she wondered if she dare go any further.&nbsp;
Would she actually make Jim cum in front of his mother?&nbsp; The next
time she opened her eyes to look at him, Jim blinked and said, "Wench!&nbsp;
You'd better run when we're done!"&nbsp; His eyes held that smile again
and Nina knew then that she did love him.
<p>"I doubt you could catch me with this!" she replied, flicking his cock.
<p>Jim took a deep breath and his hips shifted slightly, making Nina think
she had over done and made him cum, but he got control of himself and averted
that disaster.&nbsp; "Oh, yeah," he said quietly between kisses, "you'd
better run far!"
<p>Nina giggled.
<p>While the couple played, their antics hadn't gone unnoticed.
<p>Beard, the artist, and Yvette, the mother, had both noted the flush
in Jim and Nina's bodies, their erect nipples, the shifts in their hips
and the subtle movements of Nina's arm.
<p>Most of all, they could see the expressions on both of them, the passion
in their eyes and in their kiss, and Beard worked feverishly to get it
all down.&nbsp; He was attempting to put down the soul of the union before
him; he would go back later to fill in the color and depth.
<p>Yvette watched her son and Nina with a happy, thoughtful expression.&nbsp;
She had known for a while that Nina would be the one to make her son happy;
there was something about the way he talked about her that gave her the
insight.&nbsp; And when she finally met Nina, it had been confirmed by
the looks the couple traded.&nbsp; Yvette was very happy for both of them,
and wished she could have passed on that last secret before Jim interrupted
them earlier.&nbsp; Yvette had a strong feeling that Jim was working up
to asking Nina to marry him.
<p>Beard sighed, and put down his charcoal and brush.
<p>"There, done.&nbsp; I can do no more now," he exclaimed.
<p>"Can we move?" Nina asked, holding Jim's penis tightly in her hand.
<p>Beard smiled.&nbsp; "Only if you want to, Dear Nina!"
<p>Nina moved quickly.&nbsp; She pushed down on Jim's dick and pulled herself
right up against him, pushing him over onto his back.&nbsp; This caused
Jim to let go of her hair, and at that moment she rolled off him and the
boulder to the grass behind it, laughing.
<p>Free of Nina, and very aware of his rock hard penis, Jim rolled that
way too, intent on grabbing the wench who had done this to him, but she
was too quick.&nbsp; Up on her feet, she started running for some bushes
on the other side of the lawn.
<p>Laughing, Jim got up and gave chase, following his naked lover across
the grass.
<p>Yvette smiled as she watched her nude son chase his nude girlfriend
across the lawn, happy in their love for each other.&nbsp; She waited for
them to disappear beyond the bushes before turning to her guest.&nbsp;
"Boris, you have captured them beautifully, magnificent!"
<p>Beard was regarding his effort with a critical eye.&nbsp; "I'm going
to call it 'Man and Woman'", he said.
<p>"A beautiful title," agreed Yvette, seeing the essence of male and female
relationships reflected in the passion the sketched figures showed.
<p>Beard smiled.&nbsp; "I would prefer another sitting, but I will make
do.&nbsp; As it was, I doubt young James could have held out much longer,"
he said with a grin.
<p>Yvette giggled.&nbsp; "Yes, my son has met his match in Nina, I'm happy
for them both."
<p>Beard looked up toward the bushes on the far side of the lawn and smiled,
thinking about what might be going on over there now.&nbsp; It wasn't quite
what he would have expected.
<p>It didn't take long for Jim to catch Nina, but then she wasn't running
THAT hard.&nbsp; They tumbled together across a soft patch of grass, their
nude bodies rubbing up against each other and sending pleasant signals
through both of them.&nbsp; They finally ended up, as Jim had planned,
with him sitting flat on the ground and Nina laying face down on top of
him, crossways.
<p>"Now I have you!" he said with a chuckle.
<p>Nina brushed her hair away from her face, looking sideways at him.&nbsp;
"What do you intend to do with me?"
<p>Jim showed her.&nbsp; He spanked her.&nbsp; Not hard, and certainly
not out of anger.&nbsp; But with a smile on his face and laughter in his
voice.
<p>Nina wriggled and bucked, shocked at first.&nbsp; But once she realized
that he wasn't out to hurt her, that it was just another form of foreplay,
she began to laugh too, and she wriggled her cute body to show her appreciation.
<p>It soon became too much for both of them, and Jim dragged Nina over
until he could roll on top of her.&nbsp; Taking her wrists in his hands,
he held them while he made proper use of the steel-like rod Nina had created,
plunging deep into her, ecstasy in every thrust.
<p>They almost came together, Jim finally losing it just before Nina.&nbsp;
Their cries were muted but still passionate, and after the fireworks were
done, they lay still together, connected both in body and in spirit.
<p>"I love you, Nina," Jim said, the words coming out before he could think.&nbsp;
He suddenly looked pensive, worried how she was going to respond.
<p>Nina looked up at him, wondering the same thing.&nbsp; She reached up
and touched his face.&nbsp; "It would be very easy for me to say the same
thing, Jim," she said, "very easy."
<p>"Why can't you?" Jim asked, suddenly feeling scared.
<p>Nina chuckled.&nbsp; "My mother never was one for good advice, but one
thing she said has stuck with me.&nbsp; She said never take seriously anything
a man says in passion, either bad or good.&nbsp; Usually the wrong parts
are thinking for them at those times."
<p>"Don't you think I love you?" Jim asked, confused.
<p>"Oh, Jim, I know you do.&nbsp; But...now isn't the time to say it, at
least not for the first time.&nbsp; Catch me when we aren't...well, you
know.&nbsp; Tell me what's in your heart, not what's lower down, and I
will reply in kind.&nbsp; Do you understand?"
<p>Jim looked at her for a moment, then nodded.&nbsp; He chuckled.&nbsp;
"Yeah, I understand.&nbsp; But let me tell you, Nina West, I DO love you
and that's EVERY part of me talking, not just the part stuck inside you
right now.&nbsp; Even though you are a teasing wench."
<p>Nina wriggled underneath him, giggling.&nbsp; "Well, you started it,
Mr. Thumb!"
<p>"I'm going to finish it too," he said, pulling from her and standing
up.&nbsp; He took her hands and lifted her to her feet, and before she
could react, he bent low and picked her up, throwing her over his right
shoulder.
<p>"Hey!" she said, wriggling about.
<p>"Stop moving, I'll drop you!" he said, swatting her butt, which was
already a nice shade of red from the spanking he had given her.
<p>Nina squealed but held still, and Jim began carrying her back to the
house.&nbsp; Nina couldn't help thinking of the image they portrayed, she
and Jim both naked, both obviously having run off together for some sex,
and now him carrying her back with her spanked red butt and her freshly
fucked pussy on display.
<p>Nina's embarrassment was climbing through the roof.&nbsp; Yet she felt
helpless to change what was happening, not because she couldn't, but because
she was doing this with Jim, and as humiliating as it seemed, it also seemed
very right.
<p>Nina was very confused about a lot of her feelings at that moment.
<p>"Say, Mom," she heard Jim say as he carried her back to the pool area,
"I'm just going to show Nina my old room."
<p>"Of course, James.&nbsp; You must show her," Yvette replied and Nina
could have died of embarrassment right there.
<p>"Thanks, Mom," Jim replied and he continued in to the house.
<p>As they passed Yvette, Nina looked up to see the older woman and the
Russian both grinning at her.&nbsp; Nina just had time to wave before being
carried away for what was obviously going to be more sex.
<p>She found she didn't mind.
<p>Man and Woman.

<p>Part 28, Discipline.
<p>"Be sure to have my briefcase packed," Sarah Wickland called down to
her paralegal from the balcony above.&nbsp; "I'm in court in an hour and
I want to leave in 15 minutes!"
<p>Nina waved without verbally replying, her concentration more on the
phone in her hand than on her work.&nbsp; Jim was on the line and he was
talking about a trip he wanted to take.
<p>"It's something I do every year before heading back to school," he was
saying.
<p>"Oh, I see," Nina said quietly, reminded now that Jim would soon be
leaving town to continue his education.&nbsp; Somehow she thought he would
be around for much longer.&nbsp; The thought of him leaving didn't settle
very well with her.
<p>"It's somewhat of a tradition," he continued.&nbsp; "me and a few friends
charter a boat and head west to the Angel Islands for a few days.&nbsp;
I'd love it if you could come along!"
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "I don't know, I've only just gotten back to work
and I don't know if I can take the time off again so soon."&nbsp; Actually,
she wasn't sure she wanted to celebrate Jim's leaving.
<p>"Well, it isn't for a couple of weeks yet, I'm sure you can butter up
your boss a bit to get the time off."
<p>"We'll see," Nina replied.
<p>"Something wrong?" Jim asked after a silent moment.
<p>Nina sighed again.&nbsp; "Nothing...let's talk later okay?"
<p>"Sure, babe," Jim said, a smile in his voice.&nbsp; The couple continued
to trade endearments until Helen walked over, interrupting them.
<p>Helen was still under work discipline and was dressed in just her panties
and bra.&nbsp; Her shoes and hose had been taken away from her by Donny
earlier that day for what Helen was sure was a trumped up reason.&nbsp;
But Helen was determined not to let it go any further.
<p>"Nina, do you have Sarah's briefcase ready?&nbsp; We're about to leave!"
Helen asked her.
<p>Clamping the phone between her head and shoulder, the nude paralegal
grabbed a thick folder full of papers and dropped them into the open briefcase
next to her desk.&nbsp; "That should be it," Nina said, holding a hand
over the mouthpiece.
<p>Helen snapped the lid closed.&nbsp; "Thanks."
<p>Nina winked at her.&nbsp; This was a first trip for Helen to the courthouse
with Sarah.&nbsp; It had been decided that the two paralegals would take
turns at this dubious duty.&nbsp; "Hey, good luck," Nina whispered.
<p>"Thanks," Helen said, a soft smile on her lips.
<p>"Look at it this way," Nina said, "at least you get your clothes back
for the duration."
<p>Helen's smile grew, and she looked over her beautiful naked friend.&nbsp;
"Yeah, while you're stuck here with Mr. Eyeballs, naked."
<p>"Donny isn't that bad," laughed Nina.
<p>"You don't have to work with him that much," Helen replied.&nbsp; "I
swear, he would love to find a way to get me as naked as you and keep me
that way."
<p>Nina laughed again while a voice from the stairway got their attention.
<p>"Ready to go, Helen?" Sarah asked, looking splendid as usual in her
courtroom suit.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am.&nbsp; I just need to get dressed," Helen replied.
<p>"I have your clothes here; you can dress in the car.&nbsp; Come on,
I don't want to be late!"&nbsp; And she took off at a fast walk for the
back entrance.
<p>Helen's eyes were wide open.&nbsp; "She can't be serious."
<p>Nina had the case of the giggles.&nbsp; "Well you certainly will be
dressing in the car if you don't hurry!"
<p>"Bye!" Helen replied, and she ran off in just her tiny bra and panties,
carrying Sarah's briefcase.
<p>Nina turned her attention back to the phone.
<p>"What was all that about?" Jim asked her.
<p>Nina explained a little about Helen's predicament, making Jim chuckle.
<p>"You know, one of these days I'll have to come by to take you to lunch,"
he said.
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "To do that, you'd have to bring me something to
wear, which would mean you finally getting to see me in clothes."
<p>"Oh I don't know about that, there are a few places I could take you
where you wouldn't need them."
<p>"JIM!" Nina exclaimed with a giggle.&nbsp; The two lovers continued
to talk.
<p>---***---
<p>The docket had been fairly full that morning, but Sarah had convinced
the judge to let her slip in her case, with promises that he could make
an immediate ruling on the matter that would close out the case.&nbsp;
Sarah hated going to court, but other avenues in this particular case had
all been exhausted, so she had no choice.
<p>She and Helen sat behind the bar while other cases were presented and
quickly dealt with by Judge Harrison.&nbsp; For the most part, they were
pretrial hearings, a time for lawyers to first present their case before
a judge, who then decided if it needed to go any further or what form the
trial would take.&nbsp; In this state, judges had a fairly free rein about
how they wanted trials conducted in their courtrooms.
<p>This judge was one of the harder ones.&nbsp; He stuck to the book and
used every law to his advantage to seemingly make the lawyers that came
under him suffer.&nbsp; He didn't joke around, didn't care for courtroom
theatrics, and most certainly didn't allow the more casual atmosphere most
of his fellow judges enjoyed.&nbsp; But when it came down to it, the man
was also one of the fairest judges on the bench at that time.&nbsp; Bias
was not a part of his make up, he hated both sides equally.&nbsp; Sarah
didn't care much for pleading in front of him, but then most lawyers didn't.
<p>Their turn came up only twenty minutes later than was scheduled, and
with a sigh, Judge Harrison looked over at the interruption of his busy
morning schedule.&nbsp; "You ready, Sarah?" he asked, hoping that he could
get the morning docket cleared enough for his planned afternoon of golf.
<p>"Yes, your Honor," Sarah said, maneuvering her way past the bar to the
prosecutor's table.&nbsp; She carried her briefcase with her, Helen staying
on the other side of the railing.
<p>Judge Harrison nodded and waved at the opposing lawyer, who was busy
digging through his own briefcase for the file on this suit.
<p>"Go on," he said, after the bailiff read the case into the record.&nbsp;
After a minute of silence, he looked up to see Sarah staring into her briefcase,
her face white.&nbsp; "Is there something wrong, Miss Wickland?" the Judge
asked.
<p>Sarah looked up; shocked was a good way of describing her.&nbsp; "Your
Honor, I...," Sarah said, not knowing what to say.&nbsp; Her hesitation
was such that the normal bustle of the busy courtroom started to die off
as those still waiting noted something interesting happening.
<p>"Spit it out, Miss Wickland.&nbsp; You caused enough problems for me
already getting your case inserted into the schedule, so out with it!"
<p>"Your Honor...I'm afraid that we're not ready to proceed after all!&nbsp;
I'm sorry to have wasted your time."&nbsp; Sarah said this carefully, closing
her briefcase and trying not to show the slightest hint of emotion.
<p>The judge wasn't buying it.&nbsp; "Not ready?" he said.&nbsp; "Not ready?&nbsp;
You bust heads to come before me this morning, and then tell me that you're
not ready?&nbsp; Your opponent is ready, is that right, Mr. Scott?"
<p>"Aye, your Honor," said the other lawyer, wondering what the hell was
happening.
<p>"You see HE'S ready, Miss Wickland.&nbsp; And I'M certainly ready, as
is my staff.&nbsp; This entire COURTROOM is ready to hear your undoubtedly
important case, one that necessitated you jumping a three week long hearing
backlog, one that you ASSURED me over the phone not an hour ago that I
could rule upon right now and so save myself the time of a needless future
trial!&nbsp; And now you tell me you're not ready?"
<p>Sarah's face was bright red.&nbsp; That and the stiffness in her posture
was the only indication of her mood.&nbsp; "That is correct, your Honor.&nbsp;
We are not ready to proceed at this time," she said evenly.
<p>The Judge sighed.&nbsp; "Why NOT, Miss Wickland?"
<p>Sarah swallowed.&nbsp; "It appears, your Honor, that my staff put the
wrong case file in my briefcase before coming here.&nbsp; I do not have
any of the necessary paperwork that I need to plead this case.&nbsp; But
if your Honor would permit me to make some verbal motions..."
<p>The Judge's face darkened.&nbsp; One of his cast iron rules was that
all pretrial motions had to be in writing, no exceptions.&nbsp; "No, Miss
Wickland, I will NOT allow you to make verbal motions in my court!&nbsp;
Is that your paralegal sitting behind you?"
<p>Sarah turned to look at Helen, who looked rather shocked herself.&nbsp;
"Yes, your Honor," Sarah said.
<p>"Stand up, young lady," the Judge ordered, and Helen tentatively obeyed.&nbsp;
"Was it your job to see that Miss Wickland had the proper paperwork for
court today?"
<p>Helen glanced at Sarah, who nodded slightly.&nbsp; "Yes...your Honor,"
Helen said quietly.
<p>"I see," said the judge, and he then began to verbally dress down the
young woman, calling on her lack of work ethics and inattention to detail.&nbsp;
Then he moved on to Sarah and spent ten minutes berating her for having
such an incompetent staff and for the grievous sin of wasting HIS time,
not to mention the court's.&nbsp; By now the rest of the occupants in the
room were completely silent, having heard of Judge Harrison's temper yet
rarely having the opportunity to see it displayed.&nbsp; The judge noticed
this, and spent a further five, long minutes restating the rules of his
court and how no one wasted his time, making all in the room wishing they
were elsewhere.
<p>During all this, both Helen and Sarah stood silently.&nbsp; They took
the abuse because they had to, but both were thinking of the real cause
of their problem.&nbsp; Nina.
<p>Finally the judge wound down.&nbsp; He took a sip of his water and looked
squarely at Sarah.&nbsp; "Miss Wickland.&nbsp; You told me that I would
be able to rule on this case right away.&nbsp; Well, let me tell you that
I am very much inclined to do just that and rule in favor of your opponent.&nbsp;
But...I'm not going to...yet.&nbsp; You have one hour, Miss Wickland, to
have that paperwork here, or I rule in favor of the defense.&nbsp; And
it had better be impeccable!&nbsp; You understand me, Miss Wickland?"
<p>"Yes, your Honor," Sarah said quietly.
<p>"Now get out of my sight.&nbsp; Next case!"
<p>Without a word, Sarah picked up her briefcase and walked toward the
back of the courtroom, Helen hurrying to keep up with her.&nbsp; Around
them, the noise level picked back up, but most watched the attractive lawyer
leave the room, knowing that they wouldn't forget THIS day in court for
a long time.
<p>Sarah led the way up to another level of the courthouse and into a little
used ladies room.&nbsp; Inside, she let loose the anger she was feeling
at the humiliation the judge inflicted upon her, and spent a few minutes
swearing like a sailor while Helen looked on.&nbsp; Then she gathered herself
back together, taking off her jacket and splashing some water in her face.&nbsp;
She looked over at Helen.&nbsp; "I'm sorry for telling you to take the
blame," she said, "but it would have been worse for the firm if I had said
someone back at the office had screwed up.&nbsp; I hope you understand,"
she said.
<p>Helen was surprised, although she had wondered why Sarah had allowed
her to be yelled at by the judge.&nbsp; "It's okay, I should have checked
the case myself," Helen said.
<p>"You shouldn't need to," Sarah replied, "Nina should have gotten it
right in the first place."
<p>Helen nodded, angry with her friend for screwing up.&nbsp; "I guess
we should head back and get the proper files."
<p>Sarah almost nodded, but she stopped.&nbsp; A thoughtful expression
crossed her face.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; I have a better idea.&nbsp; I think
it's only fair that Nina feel our wrath over this, don't you?"
<p>Helen didn't know whether to agree or not.
<p>Sarah dug her cell phone out of her jacket.&nbsp; She dialed the office.
<p>"Specialized Affairs, Nina West speaking, how may I help you?" answered
the voice at the other end.
<p>"Nina, this is Sarah," Sarah said sweetly, "how are you?"
<p>"Er...fine, Sarah," Nina said.
<p>"Nothing troubling you?&nbsp; Nothing disturbing your work?"&nbsp; Sarah
grinned at Helen, who of course couldn't hear Nina's side of the conversation.
<p>"No," Nina replied, "nothing really."
<p>"That's a shame, because I was sure there had to be something, otherwise,
WHY DID YOU PACK THE WRONG CASE FILE INTO MY BRIEFCASE!"
<p>Nina gasped, stunned by her boss yelling into the phone.&nbsp; "I did
what?" she said shakily.
<p>"You sent me here to court with the wrong case file, Nina.&nbsp; I had
to stand up in front of the judge and tell him why I couldn't plead this
white elephant of a case in front of him.&nbsp; I had to STAND there while
he LECTURED me on how to properly run a law office.&nbsp; NOT to mention
that your friend, poor Helen, had to take the blame in your absence and
endure her OWN lecture from a very PISSED OFF JUDGE!&nbsp; Now Nina, can
you TELL how much this upsets me?"
<p>"Y...yes, Sarah...I'm sorry, I thought it was the right file...!" Nina
tried to reply.
<p>"No excuses, Nina, we don't have time.&nbsp; Right now, I want you to
transfer me to Donald's office and then go look for the correct file.&nbsp;
Judge Harrison has generously allowed me back in the court to plead this
case if I get there in the next forty-five minutes.&nbsp; Donald will bring
you, and he will have some explicit instructions for you to follow, understood?"
<p>Sarah heard Nina swallow over the phone.&nbsp; "Yes, Ma'am," Nina replied.
<p>"Good, now transfer me.&nbsp; I expect to see you in courtroom C as
soon as possible."
<p>Helen watched as Sarah then talked to Donald, and Helen blinked at the
instructions her boss gave the man.&nbsp; As bad as it was being insulted
by the judge, Helen was glad she wasn't in Nina's shoes.
<p>---***---
<p>Back at the office, Nina quickly gathered the proper files and saw that
she had inadvertently picked up the wrong stack while talking with Jim
on the phone.&nbsp; Upset, and not a little scared, she wondered what her
boss had planned for her.&nbsp; It was a times like this that she wondered
if she would be better off just saying no and taking the risk that Sarah
would tell all about her nude lifestyle.&nbsp; Surely it was better than
whatever Sarah wanted to do with her.
<p>Nina kept remembering what the waitress, Ashley, had told her.&nbsp;
That Sarah was going to keep making Nina do increasingly outrageous things.&nbsp;
Nina hugged the file to her naked chest.
<p>At that moment, Nina heard Donny came out of his office on the upper
level.&nbsp; He apparently walked over to Sarah's office and went inside
for a minute.&nbsp; When he came out, he walked down the stairs, a scowl
on his face and a pair of ladies shoes in one hand.&nbsp; His other held
a short coat, a replacement for the one Nina lost during the bank robbery.&nbsp;
Nina didn't like that coat; it was so short her long legs were practically
bare all the way to the top.
<p>"Here, put this on, I'm taking you to the courthouse," he said.
<p>"I could drive myself," Nina said.
<p>"No, I'm supposed to drive you.&nbsp; You're in enough trouble already,
Nina, do you want me to tell Sarah that you didn't obey orders?"
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; She put the file down and stood up, aware
of Donny's eyes on her nude body.&nbsp; She put on the shoes first, the
heels higher than she was used to, and then the coat.
<p>"Just one button," Donny said.
<p>Nina paled.&nbsp; The coat was normally held together with five.&nbsp;
She chose the one at her waist and picked up the file.
<p>"Come on," Donny said, pointing at the front door.&nbsp; Donny parked
in front.
<p>Nina took a deep breath as she left the building, and instantly felt
the sun and wind on her bare legs.&nbsp; She tried not to draw attention
to herself as she walked toward Donny's car, glad that passersby were not
able to get too close.
<p>Donny walked behind her, noting how the tail of the coat didn't quite
cover her butt cheeks completely.&nbsp; Nina was legally dressed, but only
just, the white plastic rain coat a few sizes too small to do the job properly.&nbsp;
Personally though, he preferred her naked.
<p>"Get in the back," he ordered once he had unlocked the car.
<p>Puzzled, Nina did as he asked, well aware of how she flashed the neighborhood
as she climbed in.
<p>Donny got in the driver's seat but didn't start the car.&nbsp; He looked
up in his mirror at her.&nbsp; "Give me the coat."
<p>"What?"&nbsp; Nina asked.
<p>"Give me the coat, right now!"
<p>Trembling, both with anger and with fear, Nina undid the single button
that protected her modesty, and slid awkwardly from her only covering.&nbsp;
She handed it across to Donny and held an arm across her breasts as she
looked about the area.
<p>Donny put the coat on he passenger seat before looking at her.&nbsp;
"Okay, here's the deal.&nbsp; You are to sit back, legs spread as wide
as you can, arms at your side.&nbsp; You are to hold this position no matter
what for the drive over to the courthouse.&nbsp; If I see you flinch or
try to cover up, then I let Sarah know and she'll decide what more to do
to you."
<p>"You can't be serious," Nina said.
<p>"I am serious.&nbsp; But that isn't the half of it, Nina.&nbsp; By the
time you arrive, you are supposed to be...er...sexually excited.&nbsp;
You will be checked upon arrival."
<p>Nina was horrified.&nbsp; "No, I can't!"
<p>"Nina, you have to.&nbsp; Sarah is pissed, really pissed.&nbsp; It's
either this or she fires you outright.&nbsp; Do you want to get fired?"
<p>Nina shivered and tears began to form in her eyes.&nbsp; Once more,
it came down to debasing herself or losing out on her career.&nbsp; She
eventually nodded.&nbsp; "How...how am I to...get excited?"
<p>"I don't know, she didn't say.&nbsp; I guess that's up to you.&nbsp;
Now, assume the position please," Donny said gently.
<p>Nina scooted back in the seat and opened her legs.&nbsp; She moved her
knees very wide apart, and then sat back, blushing furiously as Donny adjusted
his mirror to get a good look at her.&nbsp; He started the car and they
were on their way.
<p>It took half the drive over, with Nina closing her eyes to the traffic
around them, before she had the guts to start playing with herself.&nbsp;
She didn't feel the slightest bit erotic and had a lot of trouble placing
herself in that state of mind, but she tried.
<p>Donny tried to keep his attention on the road, but it was difficult
with Nina in the back seat, her fingers dancing over her wide spread sex,
occasionally reaching up to pinch a nipple to attention.&nbsp; Soon the
smell of female musk filled the car, and Donny felt himself grow quite
hard.&nbsp; He was glad he wasn't going into the courthouse.
<p>Nina worked at herself steadily, thinking of Jim, imagining that it
was HIS hands wandering all over her body rather than her own, and ignoring
the occasional car horn from people seeing her nude.&nbsp; It was very
hard to do.
<p>They finally got to the courthouse, and Donny tossed Nina's coat back
at her.&nbsp; "You can use only three buttons, and Sarah will be bringing
you back," he said.
<p>"Sure, thanks," Nina said, feeling awful.
<p>Donny turned to look her in the eye.&nbsp; "I'm sorry," he said sincerely.
<p>Nina tried not to look at him.&nbsp; Instead, she pulled on the coat,
mindful of the traffic passing by, before getting out.&nbsp; Again she
flashed the public, but at least having two more buttons done gave her
a bit more protection.&nbsp; Her pussy was almost protected and her cleavage
not so deep.&nbsp; Maybe...just maybe...she wouldn't look so much like
a cheap hooker on her way in to pay her fines.
<p>"Court C," Donny said before he drove off, leaving Nina alone on the
sidewalk with nothing on her person but a plastic coat, high heels, and
a bundle of files.
<p>A whistle from a passerby prompted Nina to head inside, and mounting
the steps outside the courthouse, she gave the whistler another view to
comment on.
<p>Inside, she had to work her way through the busy building, and she drew
a good deal of attention.&nbsp; She blushed furiously as she made her way
to the courtroom, ignoring the comments from the people around her and
wishing she were home.&nbsp; She didn't know how much more of this she
could take.
<p>She saw Helen waiting outside the courtroom and handed her the files.&nbsp;
"Here," she said.
<p>Helen didn't look happy, and Nina didn't blame her.&nbsp; Yet Nina sought
a little sympathy from her friend; after all, Helen wasn't standing there
almost naked.
<p>"Wait here," Helen said, and she turned and went inside.
<p>Nina stood, alone yet surrounded by other people, well aware of her
state of undress.&nbsp; The coat was not only short, it was also tight,
and the plastic resisted any tugging she did to cover herself better.&nbsp;
Her breasts filled the top of the coat, and without the top button done,
they threatened to spill completely out.&nbsp; Nina tried to avoid looking
anyone in the eye.
<p>Helen came back out and waved for Nina to follow.&nbsp; Up to now Nina
had tried to limit her exposure by taking small steps, but Helen seemed
to be deliberately hurrying and Nina had to move quickly to keep up.&nbsp;
Her stride and the high heels of course caused the front of her coat to
flap, exposing her with every step.&nbsp; Nina blushed and tried not to
think about it.
<p>Helen led her to the bathroom where she and Sarah had gone before.&nbsp;
Inside, Helen checked to see that they were alone.
<p>"I'm sorry, Helen," Nina began, "I grabbed the wrong files!"
<p>Helen turned to look at her, her face angry yet also showing regret.&nbsp;
"Take off your coat and shoes."
<p>"What, here?"
<p>"Yes, and hurry."
<p>"Helen...?"
<p>"Nina, you really screwed up; and believe me, you're not the only one
getting punished here!"&nbsp; Helen said, lying just a little.&nbsp; "I
have my orders too and one of them is to take your coat and shoes.&nbsp;
Now do it!"
<p>Nina looked at her friend, pleading with her eyes, before undoing the
buttons of her coat and shrugging it off.&nbsp; In moments, she was barefoot
on the cold tile floor.
<p>Helen took the outfit and put it to one side.&nbsp; "I'm...supposed
to check you.&nbsp; To see if you...well...I'm supposed to check you,"
Helen said.
<p>Nina stood stoic as Helen approached.&nbsp; The slightly older girl
touched her, probing her intimate spots the way a lover might.&nbsp; Nina
felt no excitement by it, just the humiliation.
<p>Helen stood up, her own face flush.&nbsp; "Well, I'll tell her that
you were...I can smell you.&nbsp; But I don't blame you for not feeling
it now."&nbsp; She gathered up the coat and shoes.&nbsp; "I'll come back
for you when we're done in court."
<p>"You're not leaving me here are you?" Nina said.
<p>"Yeah, I'm supposed to.&nbsp; Look, you'll be okay here; just hide in
a stall or something, we won't be long."
<p>"Helen?"&nbsp; Nina said.
<p>Helen looked at her.
<p>"I'm sorry, Helen."
<p>Helen looked away.&nbsp; "Me too."&nbsp; She left, taking Nina's only
clothing with her.
<p>---***---
<p>"I'm really sorry I screwed up, Sarah," Nina said.
<p>The three women were in Sarah's car on the way back to the office.&nbsp;
Sarah and Helen sat up front while Nina took the back seat.&nbsp; She was
again naked, having only worn the coat to get to the car.&nbsp; She sat
with her arms crossed over her breasts.
<p>"Nina, are you aware that your mistake almost cost us the case?&nbsp;
Because of you, we would have failed to serve our client's interest.&nbsp;
Do you understand what that means?"&nbsp; Sarah said with an angry edge
to her voice.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Nina replied meekly.
<p>"No, Nina, I doubt you do.&nbsp; And of course, there is that horrible
experience you put myself and Helen through.&nbsp; You have no idea how
exposed we felt, standing in open court while the judge read us the riot
act!"
<p>Nina thought she had a good idea, actually, as she sat naked in a car
going through downtown traffic.&nbsp; She tried to ignore the eyes of the
people in the cars surrounding them.
<p>"Helpless, that's what I felt, helpless.&nbsp; Wouldn't you agree, Helen?"
Sarah asked.
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Helen said, not looking at either woman.
<p>"I'm sorry, Sarah," Nina said.
<p>"Oh, you will be," Sarah replied.&nbsp; "Your cavalier attitude toward
your work will NOT be tolerated!"
<p>Nina looked up.&nbsp; "Isn't forcing me to come to the court house practically
naked enough for you?"
<p>Sarah looked in her mirror at the naked girl.&nbsp; "Evidently not,
or you wouldn't be arguing about it."
<p>Nina bit her lip in anger as the car pulled into the parking lot in
front of their new offices.&nbsp; Sarah parked about fifty feet from the
front door, and she and Helen started to gather their things.&nbsp; Nina
waited patiently in the back seat for them to hand her the coat so she
could put it on, but when both dressed women got out of the car, Nina said
"Hey!"
<p>"Stay here or come in; I don't care, Nina," Sarah said.&nbsp; "But if
you do decide to accept responsibility for your job, then come in and talk
to me.&nbsp; Otherwise, you are free to go home and I'll have your last
paycheck mailed to you.&nbsp; Your choice!"
<p>Nina was stunned.&nbsp; "But, I'm naked!"
<p>"I'm sure you'll make do.&nbsp; No one ever died of embarrassment.&nbsp;
Come Helen, we have work to do.&nbsp; At least I can count on YOU to get
things done!"&nbsp; With that, Sarah slammed her door shut and walked away.
<p>Nina looked at Helen, who stood next to her open door.&nbsp; Helen looked
very torn between following Sarah and helping her friend.
<p>"Helen?" Nina said.
<p>Helen took a deep breath.&nbsp; "I'm sorry Nina, but I need this job.&nbsp;
Look, it's just a short way, you can make it inside."
<p>Nina took a look at the busy ocean highway and the beach beyond, before
turning back to her friend.&nbsp; "Maybe I don't want to go back in there,"
she said.
<p>"Nina, don't say that.&nbsp; You have to come back; I need you.&nbsp;
I can't take...Sarah...on my own.&nbsp; I know she's being a real bitch
right now, but you really made her mad.&nbsp; But it'll blow over; you
know it will.&nbsp; You can take whatever else she gives you, it's not
like you aren't used to being nude a lot anyway!"
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; Maybe Helen was right, what else could Sarah do to
her?
<p>"Okay, I'll come in," she said.
<p>Helen grinned.&nbsp; "Thank you.&nbsp; Now come on, I'll help hide you."
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "No, you go on.&nbsp; Go tell Sarah to watch
me come in.&nbsp; I'll give you a few minutes to get her to the window."
<p>"You sure?" Helen asked.
<p>Nina nodded, so Helen left her alone.&nbsp; Nina took some deep breaths,
trying to calm the pounding in her chest.&nbsp; There she was, naked in
the back of a car and about to cross fifty feet of open space in broad
daylight in full view of a highway full of traffic and pedestrians.&nbsp;
Nina knew that Sarah expected her to be frightened, to run like a scared
rabbit for the safety of the building, hiding her body, her shame.&nbsp;
Well Nina had a surprise for the Legallady.
<p>Nina opened the car door and got out, tripping the lock and locking
the car behind her.&nbsp; She stood up straight, standing normally in the
bright sunlight, and began to walk at a steady pace toward the building.&nbsp;
She showed no fear, no embarrassment, and made no move to cover herself,
not wanting to give Sarah the satisfaction anymore.&nbsp; She was aware
of the hot asphalt under her bare feet, the hot sun warming her back, the
sudden honking of car horns as she made her way to the front door.&nbsp;
She smiled.
<p>She reached the front door and pulled on it.&nbsp; Of course it was
locked, it could only be opened with a key or by someone inside.&nbsp;
Her key was with her things, the things she didn't have with her right
then.&nbsp; She had to wait until someone opened the door.&nbsp; She pushed
the buzzer and waited...and waited...aware that her naked back was on full
display to the public behind her.&nbsp; She knew that Sarah was playing
another game with her, forcing her to be exposed for as long as possible,
but Nina felt an odd calm settle over her as she stood waiting, and vowed
to stay for as long as it took.
<p>Then she heard the car pull into the lot.
<p>Nina looked behind her to see an old car come toward her.&nbsp; Inside
were three young men, all of whom looked like they had been drinking too
much.&nbsp; Nina felt a stab of fear pierce her heart as they pulled up
near her, their eyes drinking in her naked body.&nbsp; All her confidence
began to fade fast and she stabbed the buzzer again.&nbsp; Surely someone
inside could see what was happening!
<p>"Hey, Baby!" one of the guys yelled, "You're looking fine!&nbsp; What
you doing out here with nothing on?"
<p>"Yeah," said another, "turn around so we can see your tits!"
<p>"Go away," Nina said, pushing the buzzer again.
<p>"The man said to turn around, bitch!" said the driver, who opened his
door and started to get out.
<p>Nina pressed her body against the door, very scared now.&nbsp; These
guys looked like the drifters that came through town looking for work,
and they smelled like they spent their pay at the bars.
<p>"Nice ass on that girl!" another said and the men laughed.&nbsp; The
driver walked slowly toward her, his eyes roaming her body, a slick smile
on his face.&nbsp; Nina felt dirty just looking at him.
<p>"It ain't safe for a piece like you to be running round without any
clothes on," he said, "you don't know WHO you're likely to meet!"&nbsp;
This got a laugh from the other guys.&nbsp; "Maybe we should take you home
with us, keep you safe for a while!"
<p>"I said, go away!" Nina replied, then she felt the door behind her move.&nbsp;
It was pushed open and Donald Bell stepped out.&nbsp; He didn't look happy.&nbsp;
"Go inside, Nina," he said, not looking at her but at the three guys.&nbsp;
Nina didn't hesitate, and she slipped past him through the door.
<p>"Hey, Man, we were just having a little fun with the naked chick!" the
driver said.
<p>"Yeah, I know," Donny replied, stepping inside and closing the door.
<p>"Well fuck you!" shouted the guy, his voice now muffled by the glass
wall.
<p>"Thanks," Nina said to him, very glad to be inside.
<p>Donny just looked at her, then he looked up at the balcony before walking
away.&nbsp; Nina followed his gaze and saw Sarah standing up their watching,
with Helen at her side now back in just her bra and panties.&nbsp; Helen
looked very upset, but Sarah had a smile on her face almost as slick as
the guy outside.
<p>"So you decided to join us, that's good," she said.
<p>"You're a bitch, Sarah!" Nina yelled.&nbsp; "I'm tired of you and your
games and I'm not going to cooperate anymore.&nbsp; I'm going to get my
clothes, I'm going to get dressed, and fuck your rules!"
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "That's your choice of course, but I think we should
have a chat first."
<p>"No chats, no talking, just get me my clothes!"&nbsp; Nina was pissed,
the fear in her body needing a release.
<p>"The conference room, I'll meet you there," Sarah said, and she turned
away.
<p>Nina stormed into the conference room and paced, tired of all that was
happening to her.&nbsp; The near constant nudity both at home and now here
at work was working on her nerves.&nbsp; But then she thought that it wasn't
the nudity but the motives behind it that was upsetting her.&nbsp; With
Jim, she didn't mind it at all, and she could see Brian's need.&nbsp; But
Sarah made it humiliating.
<p>Sarah walked into the conference room carrying a file.&nbsp; Nina had
expected her clothes and her anger flared up again.
<p>"Where are my clothes?" she asked.
<p>"I thought you should look at this first," Sarah said, pulling a videotape
from the file.&nbsp; Nina didn't know what it was, but it was the same
tape that Sarah had shown Donny to get his cooperation.&nbsp; Nina had
known tapes of her running around the old building existed, but this was
the first time she had seen one.&nbsp; She watched it play on the conference
room TV in horror.
<p>Sarah tossed the file on the table and told Nina to take a look.&nbsp;
The nude young woman found the statement by Mel of what he saw in Donny's
old office.&nbsp; Nina was smart enough to read between the lines.&nbsp;
She looked up accusingly at Sarah.
<p>"There's no proof that you were doing anything more than simply streaking
the building," Sarah said casually.&nbsp; "But then, there is no proof
that you weren't doing what it looks like you could have been doing.&nbsp;
I'm sure Donald's family would be very interested in deciding for themselves
what is true and what isn't.&nbsp; Shall we find out?"
<p>"Bitch!" Nina said, wondering how she ever thought she could look up
to this woman.
<p>Sarah blinked, but otherwise didn't respond.&nbsp; "Nina, you hold in
your hands not only your own future, but the future of Donald and his family.&nbsp;
To...prevent this from getting out he has agreed to let me run this place
the way I want to, and I think to be honest that he may be enjoying it
a little here."&nbsp; She smiled, then her frown returned.&nbsp; "But you,
sweet Nina, what are we going to do with you?&nbsp; I'm quite willing to
move on, to rebuild the working relationship that has made us so close.&nbsp;
Are you?&nbsp; Or would you rather leave and maybe risk that file being
discovered by someone else?"
<p>Nina didn't know what to do; all the fight had been taken out of her.&nbsp;
She thought back to that night on the beach when she rescued Donny's son
from drowning, the sight of his family, his beautiful kids, his wife.&nbsp;
Would this really destroy all that?&nbsp; Then she remembered that his
father in law was one of the senior partners, which meant that Donny's
career as a lawyer would almost certainly come to an end as well.&nbsp;
Certainly he would be thrown out of the firm, and no doubt finding work
elsewhere would be made much harder for him to do.
<p>Nina sagged, her strength going away.&nbsp; "All right, I'll stay,"
she whispered.
<p>Sarah's smile returned.&nbsp; "I knew I could count on you.&nbsp; But
I expect more from you, Nina, a lot more."&nbsp; Sarah made her way around
the table and stood right in front of Nina, who felt her left nipple being
grasped.&nbsp; Nina tried not to flinch.
<p>"Think of the fun we're going to have," Sarah said softly.
<p>Nina shuddered and Sarah let go, picked up the tape and the file, and
walked toward the door.&nbsp; "Cancel your plans for the weekend, you're
coming to stay with me after work on Friday.&nbsp; I'm not done with you
yet!"
<p>"Not done?" Nina said, confused.
<p>"Your punishment, Nina, for this morning's mistake!&nbsp; We'll be leaving
directly from the office."&nbsp; She smiled and licked her lip.&nbsp; "There's
no need for you to bring anything."&nbsp; With a laugh, she left the room.
<p>Nina grabbed a chair and sank into it.&nbsp; She sat with her head in
her hands for a long time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>Part 29, Rain.
<p>The weather reflected Nina's mood.&nbsp; On this Friday afternoon, a
storm had come in from off shore and rain was coming down in sheets.&nbsp;
At times, the rain was completely horizontal due to the wind, and it thundered
against the glass front of the office like an angry crowd.&nbsp; It made
a deafening sound as the glass rumbled under the onslaught, and looked
just as frightening, for the wall shuddered under the impact of all that
wind and water.&nbsp; It made the building's occupants nervous.
<p>Occasionally there would be a brief break in the rain, and the ocean
beyond could be seen under clouds that almost turned day into night.&nbsp;
Dark and gray, huge rollers crashed upon the shore, closing the beach for
the time being at least.&nbsp; It was the season when such storms became
common, but just because people were used to them didn't mean they liked
them.&nbsp; Storm warnings were in effect, and most of the business along
the ocean highway had closed early.
<p>Sarah Wickland was thinking of doing the same thing.&nbsp; She paced
nervously on the second floor balcony, listening to the latest weather
report while below her Helen watched the ocean give the impression it was
about to join them inside for a while.
<p>Donny had already gone home; he lived further up the coast and preferred
to be at home during these storms, just in case.&nbsp; So he'd left the
female members of the firm's "Specialized Affairs" office to weather the
storm.
<p>Nina was not in a position to see what was going on, although she couldn't
miss the way the building shuddered.&nbsp; She was in Sarah's office, kneeling
on the floor, her hands cuffed behind her back, a blindfold across her
eyes.&nbsp; And of course, she was nude.&nbsp; Sarah's anger over the events
a few days before hadn't waned, and when Nina and Helen got to work that
morning, Sarah told Nina that her punishment was starting right away.
<p>"We were helpless in front of the judge," Sarah told her, "so I feel
you need to be just as helpless for a while!"
<p>Nina's day was therefore spent bound and blindfolded.&nbsp; If she needed
to use the bathroom, she had to ask in a loud clear voice to go.&nbsp;
Then Helen, presumably, would take her, still blind and bound, to the bathroom,
where she would help Nina out with all she needed to do.
<p>It was humiliating for both women, for Nina was as helpless as a baby,
and now she had to allow Helen to take care of her most intimate needs.&nbsp;
Helen did so, for the most part reluctantly.&nbsp; Yet a small part of
her enjoyed the control she had over the nude woman.&nbsp; Helen was torn
between so many urges and emotions she didn't know what to think.&nbsp;
It was easier just to do what Sarah asked.
<p>Another wind gust shook the building and Nina clenched her fists.&nbsp;
She didn't know if she was lucky or not, not being able to see the storm
outside.&nbsp; Would it be worse if she could look at it?
<p>She heard Sarah come back into the office, her brisk walk clearly identifiable
to the blinded woman.
<p>"Helen, come up here please," Sarah said into the intercom, and moments
later Helen appeared, fully dressed at last except for her shoes and stockings.&nbsp;
Helen looked over at Nina, kneeling with her legs wide open, her back straight.&nbsp;
Even like this Nina looked beautiful to Helen.
<p>"Helen," Sarah said, "there's no point in us staying any longer, we
aren't going to get any more work done today.&nbsp; Why don't you close
up and switch us over the answering service.&nbsp; I'll meet you at the
back door in ten minutes."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Helen said, "are we still going out of town to your place?"
<p>"Of course we are, don't be silly," Sarah said, sifting through some
papers on her desk.
<p>"The weather reports don't advise any traveling," Helen said with a
glance out of Sarah's windows.
<p>"We'll be heading inland," Sarah replied.&nbsp; "I'm sure once we're
away from the coast the weather will calm down.&nbsp; Now don't argue and
do as I told you."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," replied Helen without much enthusiasm, and with another
quick glance at Nina she went back downstairs.
<p>"Well, Nina," said the Legallady, walking over to her bound charge,
"are you ready for your weekend?"
<p>"Haven't I suffered enough, Sarah?"&nbsp; Nina said.
<p>"No, not quite," Sarah chuckled, "but I promise you that once we are
done then this incident will be behind us, never to be mentioned again.&nbsp;
That is IF you learn something from it."
<p>"Thanks," Nina said sarcastically.&nbsp; Nina was tired and sore, not
used to remaining so still, not used to kneeling for so long, not used
to having her hands cuffed behind her for a full day.&nbsp; She was angry,
yet helpless to think of a way out of her predicament.&nbsp; Ideas came
and went, but the fact that she was bound and blind made all of them hopeless.
<p>"I don't think you quite understand your situation, dear," Sarah replied,
walking over to the desk for a moment before walking back.&nbsp; "And I
don't need to hear that kind of attitude from you.&nbsp; Open your mouth."
<p>"What?" Nina said, which was all the opening Sarah needed.&nbsp; She
neatly pushed a rubber bit between Nina's teeth and buckled the strap behind
her head.&nbsp; A small lock made sure it was going nowhere.&nbsp; The
bit was T-shaped and filled her mouth, an extension going back and pinning
down her tongue.&nbsp; She could still breath around it, and also apparently
drool, but any speech was impossible.
<p>Fuming and half gagging on the awful rubber taste, Nina listened while
Sarah busied herself at the desk for a minute or two, then she was ordered
to stand.&nbsp; Nina did so carefully, her joints protesting the change
in position, her balance unsteady due to her blindness.
<p>"Come on," she heard Sarah say, and a hand grasped one of her elbows
and began to lead her along.&nbsp; Coming out of the office, Nina could
hear the rain against the windows and wondered just how bad it was out
there.&nbsp; She was glad they were going out the back way; at least they
would be out of the wind.&nbsp; They took the small elevator, which made
Nina happy, although Sarah took the opportunity to run a finger down Nina's
bare back, making her shiver.&nbsp; Sarah chuckled.
<p>Nina was led along a little further until they reached the back door.&nbsp;
Sarah handed her off to Helen.
<p>"Take her out to the car, open the trunk, and then come back and help
me with a couple of file crates," Sarah ordered.
<p>"Sure," said Helen, her eyes wide at the sight of Nina now gagged in
addition to her other problems.&nbsp; "I'll put her in the back seat."
<p>"No, just take her out to the car, she can stand outside and wait."
<p>Nina swallowed nervously.
<p>"You want me to leave her outside in that?" Helen said, talking about
the storm.
<p>"It's just rain, she'll survive," replied the Legallady.
<p>Helen looked uncertain for a moment, but a glare from her boss got her
moving.&nbsp; She took Nina's arm and opened the back door.
<p>The rain was cold, and Nina thought she was stepping directly into the
ocean out front, so wet was the ground.&nbsp; The rain was coming down
hard and actually bounced upwards enough to make it seem it was raining
the other way too.&nbsp; Her naked body was instantly soaked, the rain
hitting every square inch and making Nina aware of how nude she really
was.&nbsp; Helen tried to pull her along quickly, getting soaked to the
skin herself, but being blindfolded, Nina couldn't move fast.&nbsp; Every
step was an uncertain one and she was quickly freezing to death, or at
least felt that way.&nbsp; Nina was angry and miserable and knew that she
might have run had she not been bound.&nbsp; The only saving grace, she
thought, was that the rain cut down visibility so much that no one else
could see her nudity.&nbsp; She stood shivering when Helen left her, unable
to tell where she was and what was around her.&nbsp; It was awful.
<p>The crash of waves on the shore and the drumming of the rain on the
car next to her made it hard to hear, but Nina could tell when Helen came
back and put something in the trunk.&nbsp; She left again, and for a couple
of minutes more Nina waited until Helen came back.
<p>"I'm sorry, Nina, I have to drive the car over to the back door to pick
up Sarah.&nbsp; You have to wait here, and we'll come back for you!" Helen
yelled.
<p>Nina groaned and wanted to argue, but the foul tasting rubber wad in
her mouth prevented her from forming any decent words.&nbsp; She knew Sarah
had done this deliberately, making her stay out naked in a storm when she
could have easily waited inside with her.&nbsp; She heard the car start
and pull away, and for a little while at least she felt more alone than
ever.&nbsp; Unable to see, all she could do was feel the elements pounding
her body and hear them pounding everything else.&nbsp; It was like standing
in the middle of a white noise machine, everything else was drowned out.
<p>The car pulled up beside her and Nina heard someone get out.
<p>"Come on, Nina," she heard Helen say and she was finally allowed to
climb in out of the rain.&nbsp; Plastic sheets had been laid across the
upholstery so Nina's soaking wet body didn't ruin the expensive interior.&nbsp;
Nina's bare skin began sticking to it.
<p>"Quite bracing, isn't it!"&nbsp; Sarah said over the loud drumming of
the rain on the car roof.&nbsp; Hardly wet at all from her quick two-foot
run to the car, she was in the driver's seat.
<p>Nina glared in her direction, although she couldn't see her.&nbsp; She
would have made an unladylike comment as well if she hadn't been gagged.&nbsp;
She was surprised when Sarah told Helen to take off Nina's blindfold, and
as dark as it was, Nina still blinked at the brightness after so long in
the dark.
<p>"We won't bother with that again for a while," Sarah said, and she started
to drive.
<p>Nina glanced at Helen, who looked as wet as Nina felt.&nbsp; Helen too
sat on plastic, converted garbage bags, and she was soaked through to the
skin.&nbsp; Her usually well looked after hairdo was plastered against
her scalp, and even her makeup was running.&nbsp; She looked very uncomfortable.
<p>Funnily enough, now that she was out of the rain, Nina didn't feel that
bad.&nbsp; Sure, she was wet, but she was drying off easily enough.&nbsp;
Not having clothes on meant that the water wasn't being held against her
skin.&nbsp; Only the cuffs cutting into her wrists and the horrible tasting
gag made the situation less than bearable.
<p>"Helen, you're dripping everywhere," Sarah said, slowly guiding her
car onto the highway.
<p>"Sorry, but you did make me run out here three times," Helen said testily.
<p>Sarah gave her a look.&nbsp; "Well I can't have you messing up my interior.&nbsp;
You'll just have to pull those wet clothes off."
<p>"I don't need to take them off, Ma'am, I just need a little drying time,"
Helen said nervously.
<p>Sarah pulled the car over to the side of the road.&nbsp; Nina could
just barely see the deserted beach and the closed stores across the highway.&nbsp;
No other traffic was in sight.
<p>"Get out, Helen," Sarah ordered.
<p>"Out there?&nbsp; Aren't I wet enough already?"&nbsp; Helen replied.
<p>"You're too wet.&nbsp; I want you to get out, strip down, and put those
wet clothes in the trunk where they won't ruin anything!"
<p>Helen's eyes opened wide and she looked about.&nbsp; "I can't do that
here!"
<p>"Yes you can, Helen, there's no one about.&nbsp; Now do it!"&nbsp; An
edge appeared to Sarah's voice, and Helen stared at her for a few seconds
while Nina watched silently from the back seat.
<p>"Fine," Helen eventually said.&nbsp; "I'll pull something else to wear
from my bag."&nbsp; Helen was coming along for the weekend as well and
had a packed bag in the trunk.
<p>"Don't bother, Helen.&nbsp; You're not that stupid not to expect that
I wouldn't want you naked as well this weekend," Sarah said with an evil
smile.
<p>"But..." she said, glancing at Nina.&nbsp; Helen had suspected that
by the time the weekend was done, she would be nude too.&nbsp; Still, she
didn't think it would happen as soon as they left the office, although
a part of her was surprised she'd been allowed to leave the office with
clothes on at all!&nbsp; Resigned, she opened her door and climbed back
out into the rain.
<p>Nina and Sarah watched as Helen pulled off her wet and heavy clothes.&nbsp;
The young woman began shivering as the cold rain found newly exposed skin,
and she failed miserably to cover herself as she undressed.&nbsp; Once
naked, she stood with her bundled up clothes in her arms, looking meekly
at Sarah.
<p>Sarah smiled and pushed the button that unlocked the trunk.&nbsp; Helen
quickly splashed over, the standing water on the edge of the highway over
her ankles, and thrust her wet clothes into the trunk.&nbsp; She looked
longingly at her bag of dry clothes and wondered if she would see any of
them this trip, before shutting the trunk.&nbsp; Then Helen got a shock.&nbsp;
The trunk lid had hidden from her sight the approach of another car driving
the opposite way down the highway.&nbsp; With the lid now closed, Helen
was exposed to oncoming traffic and the car's headlights were shining fully
on her.&nbsp; She squealed and dove for cover, scrambling around the far
side of Sarah's car in the water in an effort to get away.&nbsp; She heard
a horn as the car went by and she knew she had been seen.&nbsp; In her
private shame, she turned bright red.
<p>"Get in the car now, Helen, or we'll leave you here!" Sarah yelled through
the closed window, and Helen began to move again.&nbsp; Anxious not to
be left behind, she climbed back in while in full view of yet another passing
car.
<p>Sarah chuckled and put the car in gear.
<p>---***---
<p>The drive out of town and into the country was not what Sarah had promised
it to be.&nbsp; The rain didn't seem to slack off much at all despite the
distance traveled from shore.&nbsp; They were on their way to Sarah's home
in the next county, and it seemed the storm was coming along too.
<p>In the back seat, Nina sat bored and tired.&nbsp; Sarah's only comment
to her over the entire drive so far was an order to open her legs, so Nina
had to sit with her knees wide apart again, exposed to her boss and her
friend.
<p>Helen stayed silent also and sat buckled up in the passenger seat.&nbsp;
Both nude women had dried quickly, and now just felt their nudity when
they tried to move, for the plastic bags covering the seats kept sticking
to their skin.&nbsp; Not a great feeling for either of them.
<p>A car went by going the other way, and both Helen and Nina flinched.&nbsp;
Nina couldn't move much more due to her cuffs, but Helen managed to cross
her arms quite easily over her naked breasts.
<p>"Don't cover up," Sarah ordered her.
<p>Helen stared at her boss for a moment, and Nina could see her debating
whether to obey.&nbsp; Nina silently hoped that Helen would, not wanting
her friend to get into any more trouble, and after a few seconds, Helen
put her arms down.
<p>A few painfully slow minutes later, another car went by, and again Helen
crossed her arms.
<p>"I said don't cover up!" snapped Sarah, who was trying to concentrate
on the road through the driving rain.
<p>"I'm sorry, but it's hard," Helen replied.
<p>Sarah snorted and they rode in relative silence for a few more miles
before yet another vehicle made Helen flinch once more.
<p>"Right," Sarah said, and again she pulled over.
<p>"I won't do it again!" Helen said quickly, "Don't put me out!"
<p>"Oh I'm not going to put you out," Sarah said as she reached over to
the glove box.&nbsp; She opened it and pulled out a set of handcuffs, twin
to the set Nina was wearing.
<p>"No!" Helen said, looking at them with horror.
<p>"Since you can't control your hands, I'm going to have to," the Legallady
replied.
<p>"No fucking way!" Helen said forcefully.
<p>"Do you want me to gag you as well?"
<p>"Sarah, I will NOT put those things on.&nbsp; I'll sit here quietly
as naked as you want me to be, but no way will you get those things on
me!"&nbsp; Helen looked scared, her eyes wide.
<p>Sarah didn't look affected by Helen's statement.&nbsp; Instead, she
raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "No way, huh?"&nbsp; With a smile that promised
no good, Sarah dug in her purse and pulled out an envelope.&nbsp; "Here,
these are your copies," she said, tossing the envelope in Helen's nude
lap.&nbsp; "I have more...many more."
<p>Helen didn't move for a moment, then she gingerly picked up the envelope
and looked inside.&nbsp; Photographs.&nbsp; Helen took out the bundle and
began to look through them.&nbsp; They were all of Helen in the new office,
during her Cronenberg style punishment.&nbsp; In none of the pictures was
she fully dressed, and most of them showed her in her bra and panties going
about her duties in the office, although a few of them showed her kneeling
in Donny's office for some reason.
<p>Helen knew that she knelt there because that was how Donny wanted her
to be when they went over business, but the casual observer would obviously
think something different.&nbsp; The worst though were the group that didn't
show her in bra and panties.&nbsp; For an hour one day, she had been forced
to work without the bra as well, while Donny waited for some paperwork
she was late getting ready.&nbsp; The pictures clearly showed her naked
breasts as she sat at her desk, and one photo, the worst of the lot, caught
her staring directly at Nina's chest as Nina bent over Helen's desk to
grab something off it.&nbsp; Helen's cheeks burned hot.
<p>"How did you get these?"
<p>Sarah ignored the question.&nbsp; "I talked to your mother the other
day, a lovely woman," Sarah said, looking out at the rain still coming
down hard.&nbsp; "I wonder what she would do if she saw those pictures."
<p>Helen looked up and stared at Sarah for a moment, before looking back
at Nina, who sat silent and scared herself.
<p>"You wouldn't," Helen said, barely audible above the drumming rain.
<p>All Sarah Wickland did was look at her.
<p>Helen stifled a sob and held out her wrists.
<p>"Good girl," Sarah said with a friendly smile.&nbsp; "Isn't it much
easier if you just cooperate?&nbsp; Now put your hands behind your seat."
<p>Helen froze for a second, then did as she was ordered, pulling her hands
behind her seat back in a very awkward position.&nbsp; Sarah undid her
seat belt and leaned over, clicking the cuffs on Helen's wrists and making
both nude girls jump.
<p>"Now, not another word until we get home.&nbsp; Then you can take care
of Nina for me," said Sarah who settled back into her seat and started
driving again.
<p>Neither Helen nor Nina talked, and neither woman could do anything when
the occasional car went by.&nbsp; In the back seat, Nina glared angrily
at Sarah Wickland.
<p>They turned off the main highway and began the long drive up a minor
road that led to Sarah's housing division.&nbsp; The road here twisted
and turned as it followed the path of a small river, now filled to capacity
with rainwater.&nbsp; It was hard driving with all the water on the road,
but Sarah seemed to be in control and quite content.&nbsp; Every so often
Nina would see her smile.
<p>Then suddenly the front of the car seemed to drop into the road, and
all three women screamed.&nbsp; There was a horrible grating sound from
under the car, and Nina was thrown against the back of the front seats.&nbsp;
The car tipped, twisted, and almost seemed to flip onto one side before
settling upright again.&nbsp; Water poured in through the broken windshield
and Nina's world was suddenly wet and loud and very confusing.
<p>She struggled in her bonds to get back up on the back seat, but had
trouble, as the car didn't feel level.&nbsp; It wasn't.&nbsp; It was nose
down and off the road, half in the river that had burst its banks at this
point.&nbsp; Helen was still screaming as she tried to pull herself from
her seat, but her seat belt and the way her arms were bound prevented her
from escaping.
<p>Sarah was silent and lay slumped over the steering wheel, a spreading
red stain showing where she had impacted the windshield with her head,
for she hadn't put her seat belt back on.
<p>"OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT!" Helen was yelling as she struggled.
<p>Nina was thinking that as well but her gag prevented her from saying
it.&nbsp; She was half panicking herself, but calmed down when the water
only came up to dash level.&nbsp; At least there was no immediate risk
of drowning.&nbsp; Unable to calm her friend with words, Nina fought to
try something else.&nbsp; Her skin slick with cold river water, Nina was
able to pass her cuffed wrists over her slim buttocks and then over her
feet.&nbsp; Now she had her hands in front of her.&nbsp; She reached up
to see if she could get her gag off, but it really was locked.
<p>Swearing silently, Nina reached for her trapped friend and got her attention.
<p>"Let me OUT, Nina!&nbsp; Let me OUT!" begged Helen.
<p>Nina nodded, but first made a quick check of Sarah.&nbsp; The Legallady
was out cold, but that wasn't her only problem.&nbsp; Whatever they hit,
they hit hard, and it had pushed the steering column back far enough to
trap her too.&nbsp; Again Nina swore, and she moved to free Helen.&nbsp;
She undid the girl's seat belt and tried lifting her arms up behind her
in an effort to get them over the seat, but there simply wasn't enough
room.
<p>Frustrated, Nina tried her own doors, and was surprised to find that
one of them opened easily.
<p>"Where are you going?" Helen said, still in a panic but calmer than
before.
<p>Nina tried to show with her hands that she had to get out and get help.&nbsp;
Nina knew she couldn't do anything on her own the way she was, but she
didn't relish going out naked and bound into the rain to look for help
either.
<p>She got the message across though, and Helen nodded.&nbsp; "Hurry, hurry!&nbsp;
The water is coming up!"
<p>Nina didn't know if it was or not, but she knew she had to hurry.&nbsp;
She braced herself and slipped through the door into a fast moving stream.&nbsp;
Water from the road above was pouring down and Nina could see through the
rain that it had undercut the road surface, which had then collapsed.&nbsp;
Sarah had driven them into a four-foot-deep ditch where the road used to
be, and the rushing water had carried the car down to the river.
<p>Nina looked the other way and saw that a big old tree had stopped the
car from plunging all the way.&nbsp; The area was heavily forested, so
it wasn't a surprise.&nbsp; Still the river was very high and the car was
still mostly submerged.
<p>Nina took a step and immediately lost her footing.&nbsp; With her hands
cuffed, she was unable to make a decent grab at anything, and was washed
down into the river itself, unseen branches whipping her nude body.
<p>Frantic, Nina did the only thing she could, which was swim.&nbsp; She
struck out for midstream for just a moment to clear the trees, and then
swam back to shore, for she didn't want to be swept down river away from
the car.&nbsp; It was odd swimming in handcuffs, but she managed quite
easily and soon found a place she could climb out.&nbsp; It was muddy though,
and her nude body was thickly coated in mud by the time she struggled to
the road.&nbsp; She got up and walked quickly back to where the accident
had taken place, hoping the car hadn't moved.&nbsp; It was still there.
<p>Nina looked about for any sign of civilization, but the rain and the
trees cut down visibility rather drastically.&nbsp; So naked and alone,
Nina began walking along the road.
<p>As she walked, she couldn't help feeling two things at the same time.&nbsp;
She knew she had to get some help for her friends, yet at the same time
she was well aware of how vulnerable she was and hoped not to be seen.&nbsp;
It was a duality that struck her as very odd.&nbsp; Still, she used the
hard rain to wash herself of the mud, and by the time she found the driveway,
she was relatively clean.
<p>She walked up it carefully, looking out for anyone or anything, and
saw that it led into a cul-de-sac with three large houses spread out around
it.&nbsp; Lights were on in two of them, so Nina picked one and headed
for it.&nbsp; She heard laughter coming from the garage, young male voices,
and cringed.&nbsp; She was naked, cuffed, and gagged.&nbsp; A horrible
position for a young woman to be in when approaching strangers, yet she
had no choice but to go on.&nbsp; She splashed through the rain to a side
door and opened it.
<p>Conversation stopped as she stepped through, and Nina wondered if she
should have picked the other house.
<p>Six guys who looked to be in their late teens were standing around the
dissected remains of an old Ford.&nbsp; A haze of blue smoke filled the
air, and Budweiser must have done the decorating with all the beer bottles
scattered about.
<p>The guys had all turned to look at the woman who had come though the
door, and to a boy, each one of them stood with their mouths wide open
in surprise.
<p>"I'll be damned!" said one of them, and the rest chuckled.
<p>Nina didn't like what she saw; she recognized the gleam in their eyes.&nbsp;
She knew she had just jumped into the fire.&nbsp; She edged back toward
the open door.
<p>"Don't go!" one of them said, moving quickly to close it.
<p>Nina wasn't going to let him.&nbsp; She reached out with a foot and
connected solidly with his balls.
<p>"HEY!" cried the others who reached for her, but Nina was on the run,
too frightened to look behind her.&nbsp; She ran though the pouring rain,
panting around her gag.
<p>She got lucky.&nbsp; Instead of following her into the storm, the guys
just watched her run away before looking to their fallen comrade.
<p>"Don't you think we should go after her?" one of them said.
<p>"Fuck no," said another, "I'm not getting soaking wet for any pussy!&nbsp;
Give me a beer!"
<p>Too plastered to know what they had missed, the guys turned back to
the car.
<p>Nina ran until she couldn't anymore, going down the driveway and back
out onto the road.&nbsp; She followed it some more, half wading rather
than walking, and soon found another driveway.&nbsp; Nina was shivering
violently by now, the cold water sapping her strength.&nbsp; She knew she
had to try again, if only to get dry.&nbsp; She went up the driveway to
find another cul-de-sac, but this time only one house had lights on in
the gloom of the storm.&nbsp; Out front was a large black pick up truck.
<p>Nina went to the front door and rang the doorbell; she stood shivering
while she waited.&nbsp; Moments later, the door was opened and Nina saw
a tall man who looked to be his sixties.&nbsp; The man's face showed a
frown for a moment before he looked past Nina out at the rain.
<p>"What the hell?" he said, staring at her again.&nbsp; "Get in here!"
<p>He stepped aside and Nina screwed in her courage and went in.&nbsp;
She stood in the entryway of the house, her cuffed hands up and hiding
her breasts, shivering and dripping water everywhere.&nbsp; She was so
very cold and tired.
<p>The man closed the door and looked at her.&nbsp; "Jeez, what the hell
is going on?" he said.&nbsp; "Who did this to you?&nbsp; Was it those Lancaster
boys down the way?&nbsp; If you're involved with them, I swear I'm just
going to send you right back out there!"
<p>Nina shook her head, her long hair spraying water, and she tried to
pull at her gag.&nbsp; She wanted to show him it was locked on.
<p>"You in trouble?" he asked.
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>"Shit!&nbsp; Look, don't move!"&nbsp; He disappeared for a moment, then
came back with some towels, which he handed to her.&nbsp; "You look like
you can dry yourself," he said, before leaving again.
<p>Nina gratefully took the towels and did the best she could with her
limited mobility.&nbsp; Just getting her skin dry helped, but she was still
cold, and she tried to tie a few of the towels around herself for warmth.
<p>The man came back with a blanket and a set of bolt cutters.&nbsp; "Come
here, girl!" he said.&nbsp; He unfolded the blanket and quickly wrapped
Nina in its warmth, for which she was very grateful.&nbsp; At least now
she wasn't standing there naked.
<p>The old man took a look at the lock on her gag and told her to hold
her head still.&nbsp; Nina did so and was rewarded with a snap as the lock
was cut free.&nbsp; In seconds, she had the hateful rubber bit out of her
mouth.
<p>"Thanks," she said, dropping the gag and holding out her wrists.
<p>"Wait a second now," said the man, stepping back and looking at her
with some suspicion.&nbsp; "I had to take the gag off to find out who you
are, but those cuffs are staying on until I know you aren't dangerous.&nbsp;
How do I know if you aren't supposed to be in custody or something!"
<p>"Do cops usually keep people naked and cuffed like this?" Nina asked
angrily.
<p>The old man grunted.&nbsp; "Well then, YOU tell me why you're running
around like that in this weather."
<p>Nina really didn't know what to tell him about her condition.&nbsp;
She didn't have time anyway.&nbsp; "It's not important," she said.
<p>"Damn if it ain't!" said the man.
<p>"It isn't.&nbsp; Look, I'm not alone.&nbsp; The rain has washed out
a part of the road not far from here and our car ran straight into it.&nbsp;
It was washed partway into the river and my two friends are still trapped
in it.&nbsp; I was the only one who could get out, and I need your help
to rescue them.&nbsp; Can you help me?"
<p>The old man's eyes narrowed.&nbsp; "That's a hell of a story."
<p>"It's more than a story, it's the truth."
<p>"Uh-huh?&nbsp; And you just happen to be driving around all naked with
your hands cuffed.&nbsp; Are your friends like that too?"
<p>Nina hesitated.&nbsp; "Just one, and she can't get free.&nbsp; The other
is knocked out.&nbsp; Please, you have to help me!"
<p>"I think maybe you ARE from the Lancaster boys.&nbsp; Either that or
you escaped from an asylum some place.&nbsp; I think I had better call
the police!"
<p>"NO!" Nina yelled.&nbsp; "There isn't time to wait for them.&nbsp; My
friends could drown.&nbsp; PLEASE!"&nbsp; Nina actually dropped to her
knees, her entire body language pleading her case.
<p>The man looked down at her, a worried look on his face.&nbsp; "Okay,
you show me where your car is and I'll help.&nbsp; But so help you if this
is a scam!"
<p>"Thank you," Nina said, getting up.&nbsp; She held out her wrists again.
<p>"Oh no, those stay on until I know you're for real.&nbsp; What's your
name anyway?"
<p>"Nina, Nina West."
<p>"Harry Wickland," replied the old man.&nbsp; "Let's get out to the truck."
<p>"Wickland?" Nina asked.&nbsp; "Do you know a woman named Sarah Wickland?"
<p>"My daughter's name is Sarah," he said with a frown.
<p>"My God!&nbsp; She's one of my friends; she was the driver, the one
knocked out!"
<p>The old man just stood there a moment without reacting, before he said
something.&nbsp; "She put you in those cuffs?"
<p>"Yes," Nina replied before wondering if she should have.
<p>"Doesn't surprise me in the least.&nbsp; Come on, let's go get my daughter."
<p>They drove back to the accident site in the big black truck, and Harry
finally dropped his suspicious nature when he saw the car in the water.&nbsp;
The river had indeed risen, and little of it was still visible.
<p>"Shit!" he said with feeling.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, Nina, for doubting you.&nbsp;
Let's get to them!"&nbsp; He pulled the bolt cutters from where he had
stashed them and snapped the links between Nina's wrists.&nbsp; For the
first time since she got to work that day, Nina's hands were now free.
<p>"I need to go see if they are still okay!" Nina said, climbing out of
the cab.
<p>"Wait," said Harry, climbing out of the other side.
<p>The rain was still coming down fairly hard, so Nina simply took the
blanket off and left it on the seat.&nbsp; She knew she was going to get
drenched again, and there was no need to ruin the blanket.&nbsp; Harry
was therefore surprised to see Nina standing nude in the middle of the
road again.&nbsp; He had a long coil of rope in one hand.&nbsp; "Let's
tie one end around you before you go down, that way you won't get swept
away."
<p>"Good idea," agreed Nina.&nbsp; She raised her arms and Harry wrapped
rope around her waist, tying it off with a good solid knot, his face only
inches from her bare breasts.
<p>Both of them were aware of her nudity, neither of them thought it an
issue at that moment.
<p>The rain was cold, but the runoff was colder to Nina's naked skin, as
she plunged back in.&nbsp; She half swam, half crawled back to the car
and ducked back in the open door she had left a lifetime before.&nbsp;
In her hands she carried the bolt cutters.
<p>"Nina!" Helen said, turning to see her friend, "thank God!&nbsp; I KNEW
you were coming back!"
<p>Nina was shocked to see that the water had risen to neck height inside
the car and that Sarah's face was only just clearing it.
<p>"Hey, Helen," Nina said, forcing a confidence she didn't feel.&nbsp;
"We'll have you free real soon!"
<p>"You're still naked!" Helen said.
<p>"Yeah well, there wasn't time to go shopping.&nbsp; Hang on."&nbsp;
Nina ducked her head under the water and looked for Helen's cuffed hands.&nbsp;
Holding her breath, she eased the unfamiliar bolt cutter's head over the
metal links and cut them free.&nbsp; She came up shivering.
<p>Helen pulled her arms around herself, evidently very cold herself, before
moving over to Sarah.&nbsp; Nina was surprised, expecting Helen to get
out of the car as fast as she could.
<p>Helen began examining Sarah's head.
<p>"What are you doing?" Nina asked her.
<p>"Dad was an E.R. doctor, and taught me a lot of stuff growing up about
what to do in emergencies.&nbsp; What to look for so I don't accidentally
hurt someone.&nbsp; Look here; if you can reach that lever, I think we
can move the steering wheel out of the way.&nbsp; Then I think we can make
her more comfortable; she only appears to have hit her head, but I don't
want to move her too much in case she has a neck injury."
<p>"You sure?" Nina asked, amazed.
<p>The shivering girl nodded.&nbsp; "Yeah, come on, give it a try!"
<p>Nina and Helen both leaned across their unconscious boss and worked
to get her free.&nbsp; It occurred to Nina that a short time ago she had
wanted something bad to happen to Sarah Wickland, yet here they were trying
to save her life!&nbsp; One of life's little ironies.
<p>The little lever Helen had pointed out adjusted the angle of the steering
wheel, and Nina was able to reach it and trip it.&nbsp; Helen, supporting
Sarah's head, pulled her slightly back into her seat.&nbsp; "Do you know
if an ambulance is coming?"
<p>"No idea!" Nina said.
<p>"Well, who freed you?&nbsp; Are they still around?"
<p>"You won't believe this, but I bumped into Sarah's father!"
<p>"What?" Helen looked as surprised as Nina had been.
<p>"Honest truth.&nbsp; He's up on the road right now at the opposite end
of this rope."&nbsp; Helen looked over the seat and noticed the rope around
Nina's waist for the first time.
<p>"Well, go up and ask him.&nbsp; I don't want to move her anymore, just
in case.&nbsp; But we'll have to soon if the water keeps rising."
<p>Nina nodded and swam out of the car.&nbsp; She was amazed at how collected
Helen was now that she was free, and followed her instructions without
a qualm.&nbsp; She made her way back up to the road, Harry pulling her
up with the rope, until they stood face to face.
<p>"They're both okay, but Sarah is still out!" Nina said.&nbsp; "My friend
Helen doesn't want to move her unless we have to.&nbsp; Can we call for
an ambulance?"
<p>Harry pulled out a cell phone.&nbsp; "Already did, young lady, and the
police as well.&nbsp; You had better get in the truck and dry off!"
<p>"I can't, I have to get down there to tell Helen.&nbsp; When they get
here, send them down.&nbsp; We'll only pull Sarah out if the water gets
too high!"
<p>Harry nodded, and the naked girl made her way back into the freezing
water.&nbsp; She swam back inside the car and passed on the news.
<p>"Good," was Helen's only reply.
<p>The three women were still in the car when the police showed up, followed
by an emergency services vehicle.&nbsp; Paramedics scrambled through the
water toward the car, while the county deputy radioed in a request that
the road be closed because of the washout.
<p>The paramedics were both startled to see two nude young women holding
onto a third woman in the car, but maintained their professionalism and
ordered both of them out.&nbsp; Nina and Helen didn't argue.&nbsp; They
helped each other out of the car and began the laborious trip back up to
the road.&nbsp; Helen was so cold she could hardly walk, and Nina had to
half carry her up the embankment.&nbsp; If it hadn't been for Harry hauling
on the rope, they never would have made it.
<p>Another ambulance showed up with more police cars, and all were surprised
to see the nude young women.&nbsp; Nina and Helen were too cold and tired
to care, though.&nbsp; More paramedics took charge of each of them and
hurried them out of the rain.&nbsp; Blankets were issued, and Nina and
Helen began to feel human again while the paramedics checked them over.&nbsp;
There was some concern over the cut handcuffs on their wrists, but the
two young women were able to convince the deputies that they weren't in
custody for any reason.&nbsp; They declined to say why they WERE in cuffs,
but the deputy guessed anyway and kept his mouth shut.&nbsp; He had a key
and took them off the women.
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Sarah was brought up on a stretcher, a cervical
collar about her neck.&nbsp; It was only for safety's sake, there wasn't
any problem with her.
<p>As she was lifted to the road, Harry stepped up for a look at his daughter.&nbsp;
He was surprised to see her awake.
<p>"Hey, Dad," she said weakly.
<p>Harry said nothing.&nbsp; Instead, he turned away and went back to his
truck.
<p>The three women rode together to the County Hospital.
<p>"I guess this screws up the weekend, huh?" Sarah said, strapped down
to her stretcher.
<p>The two blanket-wrapped women didn't know what to say.
<p>Sarah did.&nbsp; "It wasn't going to be that bad, really," she said.&nbsp;
"I was just playing with you, getting your expectations up!"
<p>Neither Nina nor Helen believed her.
<p>"We're still friends, aren't we?" Sarah asked.
<p>No response.
<p>Sarah turned away.&nbsp; "Fine, suit yourselves."
<p>Brian Cook came and picked up both Nina and Helen later that evening,
bringing clothes for them to wear.&nbsp; Sarah didn't leave the hospital
until the next day.&nbsp; No one picked her up.

<p><br>
<p>Part 30, The Angel Islands
<p>The salt spray glistened on the skin of the nude young woman at the
bow.&nbsp; She stood silent and tall, one hand holding tightly to the rail,
while the other held the hair out of her eyes as she gazed ahead at the
boat's course.&nbsp; The sea was not yet calm after the storm of the week
before, but the swells were wide and smooth, and no problem at all for
the fifty foot cabin cruiser.&nbsp; The girl at the bow had no problem
at all keeping her feet under her.
<p>After a while, she turned and looked back at the boat.&nbsp; It wasn't
really crowded, but there were many people about, and the girl felt a twinge
of embarrassment still at standing naked before them all.&nbsp; Her embarrassment
was muted however by the fact that at least four other women and a couple
of the men were as naked as she was, and lay sunning themselves on various
surfaces from here to the stern.&nbsp; Of course, none of them had come
aboard like that; all removing their clothes well after leaving the coast
behind.
<p>The girl thought about her mad dash from the car to the boat, naked
as a jaybird because her boyfriend had insisted upon it.&nbsp; In her frightening
yet exhilarating run, she had turned the heads of several early morning
fishermen getting their own boats ready for sea.&nbsp; She was blushing
furiously by the time she reached the boat, and hid behind the gunwale
until her boyfriend, strolling along very casually behind her, arrived
to unlock the cabin door.
<p>'Someday', she thought with a grin, 'I'm going to get him back.'
<p>But now they were at sea, heading for a place where she was told clothing
rules were a little more relaxed.&nbsp; She wondered just HOW relaxed and
if she would get to wear anything at all over the next few days.
<p>She looked up at the flying bridge to where her boyfriend stood with
another friend of hers.&nbsp; As she spied the two of them laughing together,
she felt a tinge of jealousy, but set it aside.&nbsp; She knew she was
only being silly, and counted it as a measure of how much she cared for
the guy.
<p>Her boyfriend looked down and saw her watching him.&nbsp; He waved.&nbsp;
"Hey, Nina!&nbsp; Come on up!"
<p>Nina smiled and carefully worked her way back to the bridge.
<p>Up top, she moved next to Jim and Helen, aware that Helen was the one
standing at the wheel.&nbsp; She looked rather trim in her bikini top and
shorts, while Jim looked handsome yet roguish in his cut off denim shorts.&nbsp;
He grinned at Nina, his eyes taking in her nude form with pleasure.
<p>"She's really getting the hang of this!" he said with a chuckle.
<p>"Well, I told you she could learn how to do it!" Nina replied.&nbsp;
"Isn't that right, Helen?"
<p>"Piece of cake," Helen replied with a grin.&nbsp; "Thanks for teaching
me, Jim!"
<p>"My pleasure, Helen," Jim said, looking only at Nina.
<p>Nina grinned and padded over to him, wrapping her arms around him and
kissing him softly.&nbsp; She could feel his chest hairs against her naked
breasts and sighed as his arms slipped around her.
<p>"Mmmmm," Jim said, tasting her lips.
<p>Nina giggled.&nbsp; "I don't suppose you feel like coming down from
here any time soon," she said, running a finger down his back.
<p>"I really should stay up here, since Helen hasn't driven a boat before,"
he replied, letting his hands drift down until they cupped her naked buttocks.
<p>Nina turned red and tried to shift his hands without letting go of him,
aware that someone might see them.&nbsp; All she succeeded in doing was
shimmying her body against his in a most delightful way.&nbsp; Jim chuckled,
so Nina reached down and slid a hand into his shorts, grabbing his manhood
and making his eyes widen.
<p>"Can't someone ELSE, watch Helen?" Nina said with a determined edge
to her voice.
<p>Jim grinned.&nbsp; "KELLY!" he yelled.
<p>Nina laughed and let him go.&nbsp; "Good boy!"
<p>Jim waved a finger at her as if to say "Just you wait," as a lithe nude
female climbed the ladder to the bridge.
<p>Kelly was nude again, her last chance before heading back to school.&nbsp;
She and Nina hadn't talked much since her grandfather told her she couldn't
go nude anymore, but when Kelly came aboard, Nina told her that she wouldn't
say a word if Kelly wanted to strip on this trip.&nbsp; Kelly wasted no
time getting undressed.
<p>"Is it my turn yet?" Kelly said, coming up and looking everyone over.
<p>"I need you to watch Helen for a while longer, then you can spell her,"
Jim told her.&nbsp; "Is that okay with you, Helen?"
<p>Helen had tried not to watch the exchange between Nina and Jim, yet
she couldn't NOT watch either.&nbsp; She was happy for them both being
so obviously in love...yet at the same time she wasn't that comfortable
when they were in this mood.
<p>"Sure," she said, "You guys go relax."
<p>"Thanks, Helen," both Nina and Jim said, and they climbed down and went
inside.
<p>Jim and Nina had the master cabin at the bow, since Jim was paying all
the expenses this trip.&nbsp; They found the bed, and soon Jim didn't have
to worry about his shorts anymore.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The couple lay cooling off under just a sheet, the sun streaming through
the tinted skylight in the ceiling above them.&nbsp; Lying on top of it
was one of the men, his bare butt pressed against the glass.&nbsp; It had
made Nina laugh when she first saw it, then she was concerned that the
people on deck could see in as well, until Jim assured her they couldn't
because the glass was so heavily tinted.&nbsp; Now they were done and the
guy was still there.&nbsp; Nina giggled.
<p>"You know, this is a first time for me," she said softly, one hand slowly
caressing her lover.
<p>"What, making love on a boat?" Jim said, just looking at her.
<p>"No...watching one guy's naked butt while making love to another!"&nbsp;
She began giggling again.
<p>"Jeez, I knew it had to be something romantic," Jim said with a chuckle.
<p>"Well...I couldn't help looking, you had me on my back, and I needed
something to do anyway!" Nina said, trying not to laugh.
<p>"Grrrr...you wench," said Jim.&nbsp; He picked her up and flipped her
easily on the bed, giving her ass a series of quick swats and making her
gasp.
<p>Nina had never thought that being spanked would turn her on, but the
few times Jim had spanked her had sent a heat right to her core.&nbsp;
This time was no exception, and the couple was quickly lost in love again
for a little while before settling down once more.
<p>"Thanks," Nina said as they calmed down, her butt still a little warm,
"I needed that."
<p>"What, the spanking or the sex?" Jim asked with a grin.
<p>Nina gave him one of those long suffering looks and rolled over.
<p>Jim had noticed over the last few days that Nina's general mood had
seemed strained.&nbsp; When he could, he had gotten her to smile, but when
she thought he wasn't looking, he saw that she was anything but happy.&nbsp;
"Care to tell me about it?" he said quietly.
<p>Nina lay still for a moment, then shook her head.&nbsp; "Not yet, I
need time to think."
<p>"That car accident?&nbsp; You were very lucky not to get hurt, you know."
<p>"I know, but that's not it."
<p>"What then, work?"
<p>"Jim...please...don't push, not about this."
<p>Jim watched her for a moment and then brushed a hair from her face.&nbsp;
"When you're ready, tell me.&nbsp; Don't bottle it up inside."
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; What was worrying her was a decision she didn't want
to make, whether or not to quit the firm.&nbsp; The last week at work had
been horrible, not because of things done, but because of what wasn't.
<p>Monday, Nina had defied orders and come to work dressed.&nbsp; She didn't
even undress once in the office.&nbsp; She had expected a row over it with
Sarah, but the Legallady didn't say a word.&nbsp; Instead, silence gripped
the office, and while everyone did their work, little of a personal nature
was said.&nbsp; The tension was so tight it was about to shatter.&nbsp;
Nina knew that soon one of them would give, and Nina figured to be the
loser, for Sarah still blackmailed her and Helen.&nbsp; Yet Nina knew she
wasn't without some power now herself.&nbsp; Questions had been asked about
why she and Helen were both handcuffed the day of the accident, and Nina
knew that Sarah wasn't entirely out of trouble regarding that.&nbsp; It
was a sticky mess.
<p>It was also why Nina had asked Jim if Helen could come along on this
trip; she knew her friend needed the break as well.
<p>"Thanks for letting Helen come," Nina said while she thought about it.
<p>"No problem, I'm happy to have her," Jim replied.
<p>They could both feel a tension in the air now, and neither of them liked
it.&nbsp; Both were aware that keeping secrets would not be an option with
this couple, yet Nina wasn't ready to reveal her work problems to Jim just
yet.&nbsp; So instead she decided to change the subject.
<p>"Tell me more about this place we're going to," she asked.
<p>"Not much to tell really.&nbsp; The whole island chain is one big resort
basically.&nbsp; Somewhat of a Caribbean flavor, it's a place to let your
hair down and have fun!&nbsp; We go every year."
<p>"Would they really let me walk around naked all the time?" Nina said
nervously.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "I'd love it if they did, but you don't seem too
enthusiastic about it."
<p>"Would you be if you had to?"
<p>Jim laughed.&nbsp; "I guess not.&nbsp; Still, they are very relaxed
about it.&nbsp; The beaches are all clothing optional, as well as much
of the countryside.&nbsp; Many of the smaller uninhabited islands are clothing
free as well.&nbsp; In the main resort, and in town though, it is appreciated
if something is worn."
<p>Nina grinned, a little relieved.&nbsp; "I guess this means that your
streak will be over.&nbsp; You will finally have to see me in clothes."
<p>"YOUR streak, you mean," Jim replied, making her blush.&nbsp; "As for
clothing, what makes you think you will need any?&nbsp; I had no intention
of letting you off the boat!"
<p>The sudden disappointment on her face was almost too much to bear, and
Jim confessed with a soft smile that he was only kidding.&nbsp; He got
a kick in the shin for his poor joke.
<p>"You beast!" Nina said.
<p>Jim chuckled and rubbed his leg.&nbsp; "Okay, you will get something
to wear; want to see?"
<p>"Sure!" Nina said, happy to know that she wasn't going to be completely
nude the whole time.
<p>"Okay, get out of bed and I'll let you try it on."&nbsp; They both climbed
out of the bed, and Jim rummaged in a nearby locker.
<p>Nina smiled and looked at his naked body, mentally comparing his butt
with the one that graced the skylight above.&nbsp; She tried to hide a
smile.
<p>"Here," Jim said, turning around.&nbsp; In his hands was a small, folded
pile of blue/green material.
<p>"What's that?" Nina said, wondering if there was any more.
<p>Jim unfolded it to reveal a very thin sheet of almost translucent material.&nbsp;
Nina recognized it as the same material she had worn during the unveiling
of Brian Cook's first statue of her.&nbsp; Only unlike last time, when
the outfit was made up of many different pieces, this time it was all one
sheet.
<p>"You're kidding?" she said.
<p>"Come here, Wench!"&nbsp; Jim ordered with a grin.
<p>Nina walked over, and Jim wrapped the flimsy garment around her body
under her arms.&nbsp; It was enough to go around three times, and Jim used
a small metal clip right between her breasts to tie it all together.&nbsp;
The material fell loosely almost to the floor, and Nina could barely feel
it on herself.&nbsp; She looked down and saw that the three layers plus
the blue/green pattern hid the details of her body from view, but there
was still no doubt she was nude underneath it.
<p>"Can't I wear a bikini or something?" Nina asked desperately.
<p>"What, don't you like it?" Jim said.
<p>Nina looked down again.&nbsp; It was actually quite lovely, but it was
still so thin!&nbsp; "You can still see me in this!"
<p>"Of course!&nbsp; Do you think I would want you dressed in anything
I couldn't see you in?"
<p>"Sometimes I think you're taking this urge never to see me dressed a
little too far.&nbsp; But that's beside the point; this can't be legal,
can it?"
<p>"I told you the rules were relaxed, and a sarong is perfectly acceptable
town wear.&nbsp; In fact, some women just wear it around their waists;
going topless is allowed too."
<p>"I think I'll stick with it like this," Nina said with a smile.
<p>Jim nodded and grinned.&nbsp; "Sure, for now."&nbsp; He moved toward
her and grabbed for the pin.
<p>"Hey!" Nina said, not really fighting him as he began to unwrap her.
<p>"It'll be evening before we get there, and there's no point your wearing
it now."
<p>"No?" Nina said as he unveiled her.
<p>"None at all," Jim replied, dropping the web thin material to the deck.&nbsp;
"Besides, I have something I'd much rather cover you with."
<p>Nina giggled as he moved against her, and in seconds, she was once more
on her back.&nbsp; When she looked up and started laughing, Jim groaned.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dinner that night was had ashore at the resort's finest restaurant,
and everybody went.&nbsp; Nina and Kelly were the only ones in just a sarong,
although three of the other women in the group wore theirs as skirts over
their bikinis.
<p>Nina felt terribly embarrassed walking around this very populous place
in something so see-through, and couldn't help noticing the men and women
looking at her and smiling.
<p>She had a death grip on Jim's hand as they walked from the marina to
the restaurant, taking whatever strength she could from him.&nbsp; But
it wasn't until she started seeing other women and a few men in states
of undress almost as scanty as hers did she begin to relax.&nbsp; As Jim
said there were even a few topless women about, although Nina noticed that
they were asked to cover up before entering the restaurant.
<p>Inside, the place was almost five star in its service, and Nina felt
very odd sitting there practically naked in such formality.&nbsp; It was
like that time Jim took her out for dinner and a movie, only not so surreal.
<p>Nina grinned and figured that if she and Jim were going to have a future
together she had better get used to this.&nbsp; At least though he made
it fun, unlike Sarah Wickland.
<p>Nina frowned at the thought of her boss, and didn't cheer up again until
she and Jim got back to the boat much later and coupled together in the
sack.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next day was going to be very different for Nina, although she didn't
know it.&nbsp; Her star was about to rise.
<p>She and Helen were in town together alone, doing some shopping.&nbsp;
Again, Nina was only dressed in her filmy sarong while Helen wore her shorts
and bikini top.&nbsp; They were walking along the waterfront, looking at
the local fashions, the local men, and talking about Kevin, one of the
guys in the group who had spent the evening trying to chat up Helen.
<p>"I think you should go for it, Helen," Nina was saying, still glowing
from her morning lovemaking with Jim, while her butt faintly glowed from
yet another erotic spanking.
<p>"You're only saying that because you have a love life and I don't,"
Helen replied, looking through a rack of very skimpy bathing attire.
<p>"Well, Kevin seems eager to change that!" giggled Nina and Helen smiled
too.
<p>"I know," she replied.&nbsp; "Er...want to know a secret?"
<p>"What?"&nbsp; Nina asked.
<p>Helen looked about before getting closer.&nbsp; "While I was piloting
the boat yesterday, Kevin was at the bow sunbathing.&nbsp; He didn't have
a thing on, and...er...well, he looked quite well...er...equipped."
<p>"You don't say!" Nina said, her hand to her mouth as she smiled.
<p>Helen blushed.
<p>"Something to stare at, huh?" Nina said.
<p>"Oh yeah!" Helen agreed.
<p>"Say, he wasn't lying on the skylight, was he?"
<p>"I think he was, yeah," Helen said after a second of thought, which
made Nina laugh.
<p>"What?" Helen asked.
<p>"Nothing.&nbsp; Say, what's going on over there?"
<p>A crowd of men and women were gathered near a van in a parking lot,
and a guy and a couple of girls were handing out leaflets.
<p>"What's up?" Nina asked a girl who had one.
<p>"It's an ad agency here to make some commercials; they're looking for
local talent to be in them," the girl replied, giving Nina a once over.&nbsp;
Nina was still on the underdressed side of the fashion curve.
<p>"Ah," Nina said, trying to ignore her looks, as she had tried to ignore
all the looks she had been getting this morning.
<p>The guy got up on a stool or something and addressed the crowd.
<p>"Thank you all for coming, but what we are really after is a strong
swimmer!&nbsp; Is there anyone here who feels that he or she is one?"
<p>Helen nudged Nina.&nbsp; "Go on, you are!"
<p>"I'm not going to volunteer," Nina said.
<p>"You'd be perfect; you're a hell of a swimmer," Helen insisted, grinning.
<p>"I'm no model though, not skinny enough," Nina replied.
<p>Helen snorted and held up her hand.&nbsp; "Here, over here!" she yelled.
<p>"What are you doing?" Nina said, wanting to melt into the crowd.
<p>"Come on, it'll be fun!" Helen said with a grin.
<p>Nina looked up to see the crowd parting as the guy and the two girls
walked over.&nbsp; Nina couldn't help noticing the catty looks many of
the women were giving her as well, and she felt even more naked under her
wisp of a sarong.
<p>The guy came into view and stopped at the sight of her, before looking
at Helen.&nbsp; "You can swim?"
<p>"Not me, her," she said, pointing out her friend.&nbsp; "She can swim
like a fish!"
<p>The director, for that was who he was, looked Nina over and smiled.&nbsp;
"Well you certainly aren't shy, which is a big plus for this job, and if
you can swim as well as you look, then you'll be perfect.&nbsp; Interested?"
<p>"Er..." said Nina, suddenly unsure.
<p>"What are you selling?" Helen asked.
<p>"It's a hair care system called 'Mermaid Sea'," one of the girls replied.&nbsp;
"We need someone to be the Mermaid for the commercials."
<p>Immediately many of the surrounding women began calling out that they
could swim too, but the director only looked at Nina.&nbsp; "Last chance;
IF you can swim, that is."
<p>Nina held her breath and looked over to one side.&nbsp; They were only
a few yards from the marina here, and open water was just beyond a low
sea wall.
<p>Suddenly Nina figured why not, she might as well just go for it and
enjoy herself.&nbsp; She reached for the clip holding her sarong on and
began unwrapping it.
<p>"I guess I'll have to show you how good I can swim," she said with a
slightly nervous smile.&nbsp; In seconds, much to everyone's amazement,
she was completely nude, and she made a quick run for the sea wall.&nbsp;
She paused just for a moment before diving cleanly into the water.
<p>Everybody rushed the wall and they were treated to a sight of the beautiful
nude woman carving a trail through the water with powerful strokes.&nbsp;
She went about thirty yards out, then turned around before slipping under
the surface.
<p>Everyone waited with held breath for her to surface again, but they
weren't expecting her to come up the way she did.&nbsp; Nina had swum the
entire way back underwater, going as deep as she could before propelling
herself to the surface.&nbsp; She came up close to the sea wall like a
dolphin, rising out of the water almost down to her hips before falling
back.&nbsp; Everyone clapped and cheered, and the director nodded.&nbsp;
When Nina climbed out, he helped her out.
<p>"You're perfect.&nbsp; We'll be shooting this afternoon on the beach
just west of the marina.&nbsp; Meet us there at 1 pm, and we can go through
the paperwork and get started, Miss...er..."
<p>"Nina West," Nina said, looking around for her sarong, not believing
she had just been so brave.
<p>"Nina, a lovely name for a mermaid.&nbsp; 1 pm!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jim at first had been concerned about her sudden job, but he saw a spark
of excitement in Nina's eyes that hadn't been there for a while, so he
went along with it.&nbsp; He went with the women to the beach, where indeed
a film crew was set up to work, and he stuck around while Nina was legally
employed by the ad agency before they sent her to makeup.&nbsp; Many other
models and extras hung around for the supporting roles, but Nina had managed
to snap up the coveted role of the Mermaid.&nbsp; The director told them
that it was going to be a limited campaign, with only six different commercials,
all of which were to be shot this weekend.&nbsp; Nina was going to be in
all of them.
<p>They sent her along to makeup, which was a tent perched by itself a
little ways away.&nbsp; Inside Nina met a sharp looking older woman who
introduced herself as Mags.
<p>"I'm going to do your makeup, which includes doing your tail," she said,
looking at Nina through the almost invisible material of her sarong.&nbsp;
"I can see you don't mind exposure, which is good; it'll be easier for
the topless shots."
<p>"What topless shots?" Nina asked.
<p>"Didn't they tell you?&nbsp; You're going to be topless, but that's
okay because most of the cast will be nude anyway."
<p>"Topless, why?"
<p>"Well, mermaids usually are, you know!" grinned the woman.&nbsp; "Now
come on and drop that thing you're wearing,; we have to get you in your
tail."
<p>"But you aren't allowed to show nudity in commercials, are you?" Nina
said, reaching for the pin and wondering what she had led herself into
this time.
<p>"Not on American TV, no.&nbsp; But a lot of other countries have no
problem with it, and 'Mermaid Sea' products are sold worldwide!"
<p>"Oh, so no one in the States will see these commercials?" Nina asked.
<p>"I doubt it," Mags replied.&nbsp; But Mags didn't know that the commercials
would be shown on "Home Showcase," the new adult cable channel, during
its season premier of its adult version of "Survivor."&nbsp; Millions of
Americans would be seeing them.
<p>Nina, still feeling adventurous, decided to go ahead, and soon she was
naked once more.&nbsp; The tail was a rubber and latex device that required
Nina to push both her legs in at the same time.&nbsp; It was a tight fit,
but the rubber stretched to form over her.&nbsp; It looked very realistic.
<p>"We're going to have to glue it in place so I can blend in the makeup,"
Mags said, inspecting the fit.
<p>"What?&nbsp; Glue?"
<p>"Don't worry, we use a special stuff; it comes off easily with solvent.&nbsp;
In fact...wait a minute.&nbsp; JENNY, DO YOU HAVE THE GLUE?" she yelled
toward the back of the tent.
<p>"Jenny?" Nina said, a chill going down her back.&nbsp; Sure enough,
a familiar blonde appeared through a flap on the other side of the tent.&nbsp;
She seemed overdressed in jeans and a T-Shirt when everyone else was in
shorts or swimsuits.
<p>"Hi!" she said.&nbsp; "Did you call?"
<p>"Oh no," Nina said, suddenly wanting out.&nbsp; The last time she had
seen Jenny, the two of them had ended up tied up together naked in front
of a media circus and a bank robbery.&nbsp; The time before that, they
had ended up stuck naked in a tree.&nbsp; Who knew what might happen this
time?
<p>"The glue for the tail, girl!" Mags said, and Jenny vanished again.
<p>"Er...I don't know about this," Nina said.
<p>"Don't worry, things will be fine," Mags said.
<p>Jenny reappeared with a bowl and set it on Mags' makeup table.&nbsp;
Only then did she look at Nina, and recognition dawned.&nbsp; "Oh...hi
Nina!" she said, blushing.
<p>"Jenny, what are you doing here?" Nina asked the blonde.
<p>"I...er...got fired after our last...well, the bank and all.&nbsp; I
just started working here."
<p>Nina closed her eyes, wondering what was about to go wrong.
<p>Mags smiled.&nbsp; "Jenny, go make sure the other actors are done, will
you?&nbsp; I'll call if I need you."
<p>"Yes, Mags," and she left.
<p>"This will take a while," Mags said, "so if you get bored, there's a
pile of scripts right there you can read through."
<p>She then started to paste the glue in the bowl between the rubber and
Nina's skin around her waist.
<p>"Why do you have to glue it?" Nina asked.
<p>"So it doesn't shift and ruin the make up," Mags replied.
<p>Nina shrugged and decided to look through the scripts.&nbsp; They were
pretty basic.&nbsp; One had the mermaid just swimming around with lots
of close-up shots of her body and hair with a voice over talking about
the product.&nbsp; Another had her sunning herself on a rock while some
sailors ogled her, obviously attracted by her hair.&nbsp; Some of the commercials
hardly featured her at all, such as the one where six guys chased this
naked chick through the surf and the Mermaid came on at the end showing
the product.&nbsp; Or the one where the girl was about to get her first
kiss until the guy saw the Mermaid in the surf and he ran to her.&nbsp;
Silly stuff.
<p>While she read, Mags finished the glue job and began applying some body
paint, blending in the green of the tail to Nina's natural tan.&nbsp; Nina
had to perch on a stool as this was done, her long hair pinned up out of
the way.&nbsp; By the time it was done, the tail looked like a very natural
extension of her.
<p>"The body paint comes off with the same solvent," Mags told her.&nbsp;
"Now we'd better get you down to the set.&nbsp; JENNY!"
<p>"Maybe we can do without Jenny," Nina said hopefully.
<p>"Not a chance kid, unless you want to crawl."
<p>Jenny came back in.
<p>"Jenny, go get a couple of guys to take Nina out to the set, will you?"
<p>"Sure, Mags," Jenny said, but as she turned, she bumped the table the
glue pot sat on, and it tipped and fell on her.
<p>"Damn it!" Mags said, leaving Nina alone for a moment.&nbsp; "That stuff
binds instantly to skin.&nbsp; Where's the solvent?"
<p>Jenny pointed at a bottle on the table, but she was having problems.&nbsp;
Her clothing was sticking to her, and as she tried to pull it away, her
fingers and hands were sticking together.
<p>"Help!" she said, a panicked look in her eyes.
<p>"Hang on," Mags said, grabbing the bottle.&nbsp; She opened it and pulled
out a solvent-coated brush.&nbsp; "Watch this, Nina, see how easy this
is!"
<p>Mags dabbed the solvent on Jenny's trapped fingers and stood back.&nbsp;
It was obvious that she expected something to happen right away, because
after a minute she looked quite concerned.&nbsp; "Isn't it coming loose?"
she asked.
<p>Jenny answered no, both her hands firmly stuck to her body now.
<p>Mags couldn't understand it, then she had a terrible thought.&nbsp;
"Jenny, you DID mix some solvent into the glue like I told you to, didn't
you?"
<p>"Did you?" Jenny said, wide eyed.
<p>"What's wrong?" Nina asked, seeing Mags get very angry.
<p>"Stupid, stupid, stupid!&nbsp; This stuff at full strength won't come
off with the solvent; you have to wait almost 24 hours for the glue to
come apart by itself.&nbsp; That's why we don't use it without first mixing
some solvent in it.&nbsp; Damn it, Jenny, what have you done?"
<p>"I'm sorry," Jenny said.
<p>"You mean I'm stuck in this tail until tomorrow?" Nina said, looking
down at where her legs used to be.
<p>"Yeah.&nbsp; You could try pulling it off, but you're likely to pull
some skin off too.&nbsp; This is powerful stuff, because we're working
in water.&nbsp; I'll have to go get the director.&nbsp; Wait here!"
<p>Mags stormed off leaving Nina and Jenny alone.
<p>"Why is it, Jenny, that every time we meet, disaster strikes?" Nina
asked the useless blonde.
<p>"I don't know, Nina, I'm so very sorry."
<p>The director showed up, and Mags explained what happened.&nbsp; He didn't
look very happy either, and tried to placate Nina.&nbsp; Nina could see
that he was obviously afraid of a lawsuit.
<p>"I'm really sorry this had to happen to you, Nina, is there any way
we can make this up to you?" he kept saying.
<p>Nina smiled, and looked at the pile of scripts.&nbsp; "There IS one
way," she said.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Months later, during the run of the "Home Showcase" network's version
of "Survivor", one of the more popular commercials featured a nude blonde
running on a beach toward the camera, her huge breasts waving wildly as
she ran, while behind her ran six nude, bronzed young men with eager faces.
<p>The blonde was smiling but it wasn't hard to see that her smile was
a fake, for her eyes showed terror and humiliation as she drew closer to
the camera, which couldn't help but show her fantastic body to perfection.&nbsp;
The blonde then swerved to run into the ocean, and the six guys following
her quickly caught up with her and pulled her down.&nbsp; They all began
kissing and running their hands all over her nude body, while she had to
pretend to like it, before the camera panned away to where a Mermaid lay
in the surf watching all this.&nbsp; The Mermaid then pulled a bottle of
shampoo out from behind her and gave the product pitch.&nbsp; "Mermaid
Seas; it'll drive the guys WILD!"
<p>The Mermaid's satisfied smile sold the product just as much as the naked
blonde, and many wondered why she looked so smug, especially when they
heard later from a fan site that it took over twenty takes to get this
single shot commercial right.
<p>They didn't know that Nina worked hard to make sure it DID take over
twenty takes, so that a certain blonde had to run that humiliating stretch
of beach over and over again.
<p>No wonder she was smug.
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jim was amused by Nina's predicament, although he was smart enough not
to be TOO amused in front of her.&nbsp; He thought she looked lovely in
her tail, and was disappointed only that until it came off, there would
be no sex with her.
<p>Nina, thinking about more practical matters, wondered just how she was
to get around, since she couldn't walk.&nbsp; So after all the filming
was over, Jim got them a room at the infamous "Swimmer's Paradise," a hotel
where numerous pools and channels criss-crossed the property to the extent
that you hardly had to climb out of the water at all.&nbsp; You could swim
to the dining room and eat at tables set in the water.&nbsp; You could
hang out at the club where most of the people danced and drank in the huge
pool with swim up bars.&nbsp; Even the rooms could be entered through small
pools connected together with miniature canals running through the hotel
as if it was Venice.&nbsp; It made it easier for Nina to get around, but
it was still very embarrassing for her to be seen swimming around the hotel
in her mermaid costume, especially as Jim wouldn't let her wear anything
else.&nbsp; So topless she remained, until the glue finally began to separate.&nbsp;
She was glad to get out of it.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Their last evening out at the Angel Islands was spent away from the
resort.&nbsp; The entire group had boarded the boat and set sail for one
of the smaller, more private islands in the chain.&nbsp; Now the boat lay
at anchor in a calm lagoon, the group for the most part on the beach, where
most planned on spending the night.&nbsp; They would spend the day sailing
back home tomorrow, so they wanted to get the most out of this last night.
<p>Surprisingly enough, this was where the group's inhibitions had relaxed
the most, and almost all of them were now nude as they settled around the
big campfire.&nbsp; Off to one side, a nude young man by the name of Kevin
was talking quietly to a slightly older young woman named Helen, who was
the most dressed of the group in a sexy string bikini.&nbsp; She shook
her head a lot during their conversation, but her body language told anyone
watching that she wasn't really protesting.&nbsp; Then, almost casually,
she turned to let Kevin undo the tie at her back holding her top on, and
soon it was cast away.
<p>Elsewhere, couples were finding semi-secluded places to lay and watch
the sun go down, while those that remained stag, Kelly included, sat near
the fire and tried to ignore them.
<p>One figure was off by herself, though.&nbsp; Nina, wearing a big floppy
hat and nothing else, was slowly walking down the beach, her bare feet
in the surf.&nbsp; She looked introspective, and Jim, who watched her go,
was growing concerned.&nbsp; He got up and followed her.
<p>He caught up to her a few hundred yards down the beach, where she stood
and watched the sun boil into the ocean horizon.&nbsp; He didn't make an
obvious attempt to stay silent, but the wet sand didn't betray his approach.&nbsp;
He quietly stood beside her as the sun went out.
<p>"Lovely, isn't it," he said quietly.
<p>Nina nodded.&nbsp; "I can never get tired of seeing a sunset like that.&nbsp;
Back home, it just drops into the ground, but here, it's an event all its
own."
<p>"You don't talk much about home," he said.
<p>"Don't want to.&nbsp; Not right now, anyway."&nbsp; She reached out
and took his arm, pressing her nude body against his, her head against
his shoulder.&nbsp; "Oh, I wish you weren't leaving for school!" she said.
<p>Jim smiled a guilty smile.&nbsp; "Well...I have some news for you there.&nbsp;
I was just waiting for a good time to tell you."
<p>Nina drew back a little.&nbsp; "What?" she said, her expression waiting
for a disappointment.
<p>"I'm not leaving.&nbsp; I...er...transferred to the local university.&nbsp;
I can finish out my last year of Pre Med there.&nbsp; I couldn't leave
you."
<p>Nina stood still for a moment, then merged back into his arms.&nbsp;
He hugged her tightly and they kissed.&nbsp; "Thank you," she said.
<p>"Would this be a good time to say I love you, Nina West?" he asked,
glad she was happy about his change of plan.
<p>"A very good time," Nina replied with a smile.
<p>"I love you, Nina West," he said with a grin.
<p>"I love YOU, Jim Barb," Nina replied, sighing sweetly and relaxing into
his arms.
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "There, that wasn't so hard, was it?"
<p>Nina just hmmmm'd.
<p>"Is this what's been bothering you, my leaving?" Jim asked her.&nbsp;
He felt her stiffen a little.
<p>"No...it's...work."
<p>"Tell me," he ordered.
<p>She did.&nbsp; Every degrading incident from the moment she first met
Sarah Wickland.&nbsp; All those times she was nude in her office; all those
times with Franklin, Sarah's former assistant.&nbsp; That time with Katie
in the gay bar.&nbsp; She even told Jim about what she had to do at the
CoRTN compound, and how Sarah was also blackmailing Helen.
<p>At first, Jim was amused by Sarah's attempts to keep Nina naked as much
as possible.&nbsp; But looking in Nina's eyes, he could see that to his
nude girlfriend it was no joke.&nbsp; One thing that really surprised Jim
though, was that while Nina talked about things getting really bad, she
didn't outright condemn everything that happened to her.
<p>"It's just that lately she had become so malicious about it.&nbsp; I
never would have thought myself ever saying this, but at first, it was
actually kind of fun, working nude there.&nbsp; I mean...kinda like how
I feel when you test my limits...you know?&nbsp; There was a certain thrill.&nbsp;
But now it has become mean and dangerous.&nbsp; I don't know what to do,"
she said.
<p>"Do you want to quit your job?" he asked her.
<p>"I...I don't know.&nbsp; So much of my future depends on my completing
my two-year term with the firm.&nbsp; Do that, and they pay my way through
law school, and I have a real job with them when I pass the Bar exam.&nbsp;
I can't just throw that away."
<p>"You won't.&nbsp; I'll pay your way through law school, and you can
get a job with any firm you choose!"
<p>"I'm not going to ask you for money, Jim," Nina said firmly.
<p>"You don't have to ask," Jim replied.
<p>"No, Jim.&nbsp; Besides, if I quit, I'll probably have to leave Brian
Cook's place.&nbsp; I doubt he would want me around."
<p>"So come live with me!&nbsp; I'm getting a place of my own now that
I'm going to be living in town.&nbsp; I was going to ask you anyway if
you wanted to share it with me!"
<p>Nina looked up at him in the fading light.&nbsp; "That would be so great,"
she whispered, "I'd like nothing better.&nbsp; But I can't...you don't
understand."
<p>"What, your rent?&nbsp; Is that what you're worried about?&nbsp; Well,
don't.&nbsp; Whatever you owe Brian, I'll pay off.&nbsp; You'll be free
and clear."
<p>"There you are, throwing money at a problem again," she said pulling
away from him.
<p>"Why not?&nbsp; Sometimes it's the best way to deal with something!"
<p>"I can't have you saving me like that...it makes me feel like...well..."
<p>"What, like you're after me simply because I have money?" Jim said,
moving to her.&nbsp; "Nina, if I thought that in the least, we wouldn't
be together.&nbsp; I know you aren't after my money.&nbsp; It's my charm
and devilish good looks that have you enthralled."&nbsp; Jim was glad to
see he got a small smile from her.
<p>"Yeah...sure," she said.&nbsp; "But seriously, I can't just take your
money."
<p>Jim took a deep breath.&nbsp; He had something else he wanted to say
to her, something that had been bouncing around his head for a while now.&nbsp;
He moved until he stood before her, two nude people alone on a deserted
beach.&nbsp; "What if it wasn't MY money?&nbsp; What if it was OUR money?"
<p>"What are you talking about?" Nina said, her heart suddenly racing.
<p>Jim dropped to one knee and Nina gasped.&nbsp; "Nina, I love you, you
don't know how MUCH I love you.&nbsp; Marry me, be my wife!"
<p>Nina stood still for a moment, her mind a blank.&nbsp; Then she spoke,
and even SHE was surprised by her response.&nbsp; "If you hand me a ring
right now, I'm going to HAVE to ask where you were hiding it!"
<p>Jim looked at her for a second, then he burst out laughing.&nbsp; Nina
joined him, and she sunk to her knees beside him in her laughter.&nbsp;
They hugged and continued to laugh as they lay down in the sand, until
peace descended once more.
<p>Jim held Nina, his hands caressing her smooth, bare skin.&nbsp; "I take
it you aren't saying yes, then?" he said, a trace of disappointment in
his voice.
<p>"Don't be so defeatist.&nbsp; You did spring this on me rather suddenly,"
Nina replied, still numb, but joyfully numb.&nbsp; "Can I think about it?"
<p>"Sure, but if it's no, then don't look to me to give you a ride off
this island in the morning," he said with a relieved grin.
<p>She hit him.
<p>"Just think," he went on, "the next people here would find a ravishingly
beautiful naked woman waiting for them, eager to do anything to get off
the island!"
<p>"You beast!" Nina said, stifling a smile and hitting him again.
<p>"So willing...so eager...a beautiful island girl as nature intended!"
he said with a grin.
<p>"Did nature intend for you to be a smartass?" Nina said, moving to hit
him once again.&nbsp; But he caught her hand and brought it up over her
head.
<p>"No.&nbsp; Nature intended me to do other things," he replied, rolling
over and pinning her to the sand with his body.
<p>Nature looked on while it took its course.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The nude young woman stood at the bow of the boat as it plowed through
the ocean waves, sea spray making her skin glisten.&nbsp; She looked ahead
to their course, watching for the faint glimpse of land that she knew wouldn't
appear for many hours yet.&nbsp; She glanced backward and up at the flying
bridge where she saw her friend at the wheel.&nbsp; With her was another
young man, and the two of them were both nude and enjoying each other's
company.&nbsp; Nina knew they weren't intimate yet, but Helen shyly had
hopes.
<p>Movement beside her, and Jim put his arm about her.&nbsp; "Hi," he said.
<p>"Hey, Lover," Nina replied, her butt feeling a pleasant warmth.
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Jim asked.
<p>"What's waiting for me back there," Nina replied, indicating where they
were going.
<p>"You know...there might be something we can do, to even the odds," he
whispered.
<p>"What?"
<p>"That woman...Katie.&nbsp; It seems to me that she has power over Sarah
Wickland.&nbsp; Why not ask HER for help!"
<p>Nina had actually thought of that.&nbsp; But Katie struck her as someone
who would demand a price for her 'help'.&nbsp; Could she afford the price?
<p>Jim pulled Nina close.&nbsp; "When we get back, we'll go together.&nbsp;
We'll put your life back together, I promise."
<p>In his arms, Nina felt safe.&nbsp; She smiled.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Part 31, Never Smile at a Crocodile.
<p>In the daylight the club didn't look so good, but then most bars are
creatures of the night anyway, and like vampires, don't do well in sunlight.&nbsp;
Still, Helen and Nina had chosen this time of day to visit Katie because
they hoped that without a crowd to play to, the woman might be more approachable.&nbsp;
Nina, Helen, and Jim had all talked together after they had gotten back
from the Angel Islands, and had agreed that Katie was their best hope of
getting out from under Sarah Wickland, their boss.&nbsp; But they had to
rush to get to Katie, because Sarah was due back in town the next day,
and the two young women didn't want to spend another day subject to the
Legallady's whims.&nbsp; Nina and Helen, because they were rushed, had
to go without Jim, though.&nbsp; He had a prior engagement that afternoon
with the admissions office of his new school, one he couldn't break.
<p>"Good luck," he told Nina, kissing her softly before leaving her home
earlier, "and be careful."
<p>"We will," she replied, sad to see him go.
<p>But Nina was glad she wasn't going alone, and when Kelly told them that
they would probably find Katie at the club, they left immediately.
<p>Now they sat in Helen's car in the almost empty parking lot, watching
the building.&nbsp; Both of them were trying to gather the courage to go
inside.
<p>"Do you get the feeling we're about to make a deal with the Devil?"
Helen asked quietly.
<p>Nina looked over at her friend.&nbsp; "I know your last meeting with
her really affected you.&nbsp; If you like, I can go in alone!"
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "No, I couldn't let you go alone.&nbsp;
Together, we can protect each other."
<p>Nina smiled and squeezed Helen's hand.&nbsp; "Okay, let's go."
<p>They got out, and dressed almost identically in long pants and blouses,
they made their way to the door.
<p>Inside it was almost too dark after the brightness of the sun, and the
two young women stood blinking for a full minute while their eyes adjusted.&nbsp;
It was quiet inside, and it also seemed oddly dead.&nbsp; This place obviously
only came to life at night, Nina thought.&nbsp; They made their way further
inside, until they heard a female voice coming from the back.
<p>Helen held her breath and took Nina's hand, for she recognized Katie's
voice.
<p>The two girls walked around the bar and saw a small office set in one
corner by the bathrooms.&nbsp; The door was open, and sitting behind the
desk inside was Katie, on the phone.&nbsp; She was elegantly dressed in
a black dress, and looked up to see who had invaded her privacy.&nbsp;
She smiled, and Nina suddenly heard a song from her childhood playing in
her head.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Never smile at a crocodile,
<p>No you can't get friendly with a crocodile.
<p>Don't be taken in, by his welcome grin,
<p>He's imagining how well you'd fit within his skin!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nina almost giggled.
<p>Katie put the phone down and stared at her visitors.&nbsp; "Well, well,
look who we have here.&nbsp; Come in!" she said.
<p>The two young women stepped carefully into the office as if testing
for trap doors.&nbsp; Mixed feelings made each of them wonder if they were
doing the right thing.
<p>Katie looked them both up and down rather deliberately, her gaze settling
on Helen for a moment.&nbsp; "Helen, lovely as usual.&nbsp; I do hope we
get to spend more time together later," she said warmly.
<p>Helen took a deep breath before answering.&nbsp; "To be honest, Katie,
I hope we don't!"
<p>Katie laughed.&nbsp; "Well, I never punish honesty, or at least I usually
don't, so maybe I can change your mind later."&nbsp; Then she looked at
Nina again, and Nina recognized lust when she saw it.&nbsp; It made her
blush.&nbsp; "If I had known the two of you were coming, I would have set
up a proper reception for you!"
<p>"That's okay," Nina said, "we don't need one."
<p>"Well, what do you need then?" Katie answered, "I doubt this is a social
visit."
<p>Nina and Helen were both taken back a bit by Katie's direct question.&nbsp;
Nina decided to be direct too.
<p>"Sarah Wickland," she said.
<p>"What about her?" Katie asked.
<p>"You have something on her, something that gives you some control over
her; what is it?"
<p>Katie laughed again.&nbsp; "Really, little girl!&nbsp; Do you expect
me to answer that?&nbsp; If that is what you came for, then you're wasting
your time.&nbsp; I'm not about to reveal THAT secret until I need to!"
<p>"But it IS true that you have something on her?" Nina asked.
<p>Katie inclined her head in a slight nod.
<p>Nina paused and glanced at Helen for a second.&nbsp; Both had agreed
earlier that Nina would do the talking.&nbsp; "Okay, well I guess we don't
have to know what it is.&nbsp; But Katie, I need to ask you a...favor."
<p>Katie had been leaning back in her chair, but she now sat up.&nbsp;
"A favor..." she said slowly, stretching the word out.&nbsp; "Well, well,
well.&nbsp; In that case, sit down ladies, so we can talk!"
<p>Nina and Helen really didn't like the sound of Katie's invitation, but
they sat anyway.
<p>"A favor," Katie said again, pushing her chair back away from the desk
a few feet.&nbsp; "Now I am always ready to do a favor for a friend, but
where are my manners?&nbsp; You must be thirsty.&nbsp; Ashley, go get us
something to drink, dear!"
<p>Nina and Helen both looked about the office, puzzled at Katie's last
remark, but then heard some shuffling and bumping from under the desk.&nbsp;
Seconds later, a head appeared and Nina recognized the waitress from the
last time she had come here.&nbsp; Ashley.&nbsp; The girl tried to keep
her face neutral as she crawled out from under the desk where she had been
hiding, but there was no mistaking the humiliation she felt at being revealed.&nbsp;
Especially as she was nude, except for a steel band about her throat, and
cuffs holding her hands behind her.&nbsp; Also, her face glistened slightly
as if covered in something, and both Helen and Nina began to blush as they
realized what they had interrupted.
<p>Ashley didn't look at them, and as she turned, Nina could see that she
was completely hairless from the neck down.&nbsp; She watched as the mortified
girl quickly left the room.
<p>"A darling, isn't she?" Katie said with a smile.&nbsp; "So, I take it
this...favor...has to do with Sarah?"
<p>Nina nodded, and began to tell Katie about how Sarah was blackmailing
them both.&nbsp; "What we want is an equalizer," Nina said, "something
that would stop her from using what she has on us.&nbsp; We were hoping
that you could help!"
<p>Katie sat back.&nbsp; "It sounds like rather harmless fun to me!" she
said with a grin.
<p>Ashley chose that moment to come back in.&nbsp; She was still bound
as before, but someone had hung a tray around her neck, where it sat just
below her breasts.&nbsp; Set into holders in the tray was a pitcher of
something brown and several glasses.
<p>"Iced tea.&nbsp; Perfect!" Katie said with a clap of her hands.&nbsp;
"Help yourselves, ladies.&nbsp; Ashley isn't in quite the position to pour
right now."
<p>Both Nina and Helen just sat and stared at Ashley, until she moved closer
to them.&nbsp; She dropped to her knees between their two chairs, her back
to Katie, and offered the tray to them.&nbsp; Helen pulled the pitcher
from its holder, making Ashley gasp.&nbsp; Apparently the holder kept the
ice cold pitcher pressed right against her left breast, chilling it completely.
<p>Eyes wide, Helen took a glass and poured herself some of the cold drink,
then she poured some for Nina, before putting the cold pitcher back in
its holder.&nbsp; Through this, Ashley avoided eye contact with either
woman.
<p>Nina didn't know where to look, and tried not to stare when the nude
waitress moved on to serve Katie.&nbsp; She couldn't help watching though,
as Katie slowly pulled the cold pitcher from its holder and poured her
own drink.&nbsp; Katie then took an ice cube out of her drink with her
fingers and gestured for Ashley to turn around.&nbsp; Nina and Helen watched
captivated, as Katie calmly pushed the ice cube up into Ashley's rear as
if it was a perfectly normal thing to do in front of visitors.&nbsp; She
patted Ashley's rump affectionately.&nbsp; "Now be a dear and take the
tray back to Marshal, will you?&nbsp; Hurry back!"
<p>Ashley nodded, and blushing very red, she moved quickly out of the room.&nbsp;
Katie sipped her drink and smiled at her guests.&nbsp; She noted the distressed
looks on both of them.&nbsp; "Oh, don't mind Ashley," she said, "she and
I have our own little arrangement.&nbsp; It's harmless, really!"
<p>Nina and Helen both wondered about her definition of 'harmless'.
<p>"Are you going to help us?" Nina asked.
<p>Katie blinked before answering.&nbsp; "What Sarah and I have, is between
us.&nbsp; I'm not about to use it for someone else's benefit."
<p>Helen sighed and Nina dropped her head.
<p>"But..." Katie went on, "this doesn't mean that I can't help you in
another way."
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Nina.
<p>Katie leaned forward.&nbsp; "What if I was to help you get something
on her yourselves?&nbsp; Something of your own that would allow you to
get back the freedom you want.&nbsp; Sound good?"
<p>Helen nodded.&nbsp; "Yes, it does."
<p>Nina wasn't so sure.&nbsp; "You'd help us find something to blackmail
Sarah with?"
<p>"Not find...make!&nbsp; It's always better to grow your own," chuckled
the brunette.
<p>"That sound's good," Helen said.
<p>"Wait a minute," said Nina.&nbsp; "I think we're making a mistake here.&nbsp;
I think we'd better go."&nbsp; Nina was getting cold feet about the whole
idea.&nbsp; She didn't TRUST Katie.
<p>"Go?"&nbsp; Helen said, looking at her friend.&nbsp; "Katie has just
told us that she would help us, and you want to go?"
<p>Nina paused, but before she could answer, she saw Ashley come back in,
minus the tray.&nbsp; The nude young woman stopped just inside the door.
<p>Katie stared at Nina, and pushed back from the desk.&nbsp; "Back to
work, Ashley," she said.
<p>Ashley whimpered, her face showing her misery, but Katie didn't even
look at her.&nbsp; She didn't need to.&nbsp; Slowly, as if going to her
death, Ashley padded around the desk and sunk to her knees, moving out
of sight of the two young women.
<p>Katie, after a moment, moved forward, trapping the girl under her desk.&nbsp;
Nina and Helen didn't want to think about what Ashley was doing under there.
<p>"I can understand your reservations," Katie said with a grin.&nbsp;
"But let me tell you something about that woman.&nbsp; She is slick, very
slick.&nbsp; I've known her for years, and have rarely known her to come
out the worse in a deal.&nbsp; It's what makes her such a good lawyer,
but it also makes her a really bad loser...and I know she is gunning for
the two of you.&nbsp; I heard about that little mishap in court.&nbsp;
Do you think that's all forgotten already?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; She is going
to get her pound of flesh from each of you over that embarrassment, and
she won't do it quickly.&nbsp; She'll take her time, and will savor each
and every ounce.&nbsp; I know, because we're a lot alike in some ways.&nbsp;
You can't afford to let her get her way much longer, for soon her claws
will be so deep into you that anything-ANYTHING-would be preferable to
what she can do to you.&nbsp; Isn't that right, Ashley?"
<p>A grunt sounded from below the desktop.
<p>"It took me years to finally best her, and I know you don't have that
kind of time.&nbsp; Let me help you, because dealing with Sarah Wickland
would be a pleasure."
<p>Nina looked her in the eye.&nbsp; "It seems that we don't have a choice,
do we?"
<p>"Not really, not if you want to win."
<p>Nina finally nodded and stood up.&nbsp; "Okay then.&nbsp; Perhaps you
can give me a call then later, when you aren't so...busy.&nbsp; We can
go over details."
<p>Katie smiled and practically purred.&nbsp; "I think we're forgetting
something."
<p>"What?" Nina said, her blood turning cold.
<p>"What's in it for me?" Katie replied.
<p>"You said it would be a pleasure dealing with her," Nina said, sitting
down again.
<p>"Oh and it will, believe me.&nbsp; But that's what I like about favors...you
do one for someone, and they do one for you in return!"&nbsp; She looked
lustfully at Nina again.
<p>Nina and Helen looked at each other.&nbsp; "I'm not having sex with
you!" Nina said firmly, making Katie chuckle.
<p>"Oh, I know you won't...now.&nbsp; But that's not what my price is."
<p>"What do you want?"
<p>Katie smiled, and that song ran through Nina's head again.&nbsp; "Two
things...one small, one not so small, but not so big either."
<p>"I'm listening," Nina said quietly.
<p>"First thing, right now.&nbsp; Nina, Helen, I want you to both stand
up and get undressed, right now.&nbsp; You will stay standing for a few
minutes, and then I will let you get dressed and go."
<p>"Is that it?"&nbsp; Nina asked suspiciously.
<p>"That's all, for the first thing.&nbsp; Such a small favor, how can
you refuse?"
<p>Nina looked at Helen, who looked scared.&nbsp; But she nodded and stood
up.&nbsp; "I'm willing, let's get it over with."
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; For her it wasn't the nudity, it was just being there
in front of Katie.&nbsp; Yet it did seem like such a small thing compared
to getting out from under Sarah.&nbsp; She stood up too.
<p>Both Nina and Helen had unconsciously overdressed before coming here,
wanting to hide themselves from Katie.&nbsp; But now they both stood nervously
and began to remove their clothing, aware of Katie's eyes upon them, and
of what was probably happening below the desk.
<p>Nina was naked first, her lack of a bra giving her one less thing to
take off, and she waited patiently for Helen to join her in their nudity.&nbsp;
Helen undressed more slowly, and seemed to remove each item of clothing
with great effort.&nbsp; But soon both were nude, and they stood, unsure
what to do next.
<p>"Hands behind your heads," Katie said.&nbsp; "Yes, that's right.&nbsp;
Now, don't move until I say so."
<p>Nina and Helen both stood still, blushing under the gaze of the club
owner as she looked them over.&nbsp; To Nina and Helen's collective horror,
Katie's breathing began to shallow and quicken, and a flush appeared on
her face.&nbsp; They watched, half fascinated, half disgusted, as Katie
was evidently brought to orgasm by Ashley under the desk while Katie took
in their nude bodies.&nbsp; Nina felt thoroughly humiliated at being used
that way.&nbsp; She knew she had probably become the masturbatory fantasy
of at least a few of the people she had been manipulated into exposing
herself to since she moved out here, but to have it done right in front
of her face was appalling.
<p>Katie smiled, her event apparently over.&nbsp; "Before you dress, the
second favor.&nbsp; I want you both to come back here tonight, 8 pm.&nbsp;
You will both dance for me, for the club."
<p>"What?" Nina said, putting her hands down.
<p>"You will both come dance on stage tonight.&nbsp; You will dance, and
you will take suggestions from the crowd, which you will obey.&nbsp; Four
hours, that's all.&nbsp; To make things easy on you, I'll set some restrictions.&nbsp;
You don't leave the stage, and no one, except perhaps Ashley here, goes
on it.&nbsp; Agreed?"
<p>"No!&nbsp; I'm not going to dance for your friends!" Nina said.
<p>"Are you sure about that?" Katie said.&nbsp; "What about you, Helen;
does it sound fair to you?"
<p>Helen stood with her arms about her chest.&nbsp; "Is that all we have
to do, dance?"
<p>Katie laughed.&nbsp; "I doubt very much that would be all you have to
do.&nbsp; I expect that the two of you would be nude fairly soon after
you got on stage.&nbsp; But no one will touch you, that I promise."
<p>Helen looked at Nina.&nbsp; "Well, that sounds okay."
<p>"Helen!" Nina said.
<p>"Come on, Nina, one show, one night.&nbsp; It gets us away from Sarah.&nbsp;
I think we could stand one more night for that!"
<p>Nina looked down, she didn't know what to think.
<p>"Well?"&nbsp; Katie asked.
<p>Nina made her decision.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Maybe we should have let Jim come along," Helen said, staring at the
outside of the club in the dark.&nbsp; She and Nina were now back at the
club, just before eight, the time specified by Katie for their...payment.
<p>"No, he would only have stopped us.&nbsp; He wouldn't allow this," Nina
said nervously.
<p>"You sure?&nbsp; I know he isn't adverse to these kinds of games, you've
told me yourself!"
<p>"No!&nbsp; Jim is different.&nbsp; Sure, he likes to play naked games,
and sometimes they are a little humiliating.&nbsp; But...well, there is
nothing malicious about what Jim wants.&nbsp; It's all in fun.&nbsp; Nothing
like Sarah or..." she gestured at the club.
<p>Helen nodded slowly and sighed.&nbsp; "It's a pity he can't just buy
Sarah off!"
<p>"He could, but I won't ask him," Nina replied.&nbsp; "I don't want to...well...I
have to solve my own problems, I can't have him spending his money on me
like that."
<p>Helen sighed again, but said nothing.
<p>Nina looked at her.&nbsp; "Helen, you don't have to do this.&nbsp; I
can go in alone and say you couldn't make it.&nbsp; You don't have to put
yourself through all this."
<p>"No.&nbsp; If you go, I go!&nbsp; I can't let you go in there alone.&nbsp;
Besides, she said she wanted both of us, right?"&nbsp; Helen gave Nina
a brave smile, and they held hands for a second, combining their strength.
<p>"You're a good friend, Helen," Nina said.
<p>Helen blinked.&nbsp; "You too," she whispered.
<p>They got out of the car and headed into the club.
<p>Katie was waiting for them.&nbsp; "Ah!&nbsp; There you are, right on
time.&nbsp; Come on, come on!"
<p>Nina and Helen didn't say a word as they were led through the crowd
of mostly women, all who looked at them with interest.&nbsp; Had word spread
already about the evening's entertainment?&nbsp; Katie stopped just short
of a small raised stage normally used for live bands, although a jukebox
was playing at the moment.
<p>"Okay, here are the rules," she said in a business-like manner.&nbsp;
"Your four hours start the second you go up on stage.&nbsp; While there,
you do whatever the crowd yells at you to do, and if they aren't telling
you to do anything, then you dance to the music.&nbsp; No one else except
for Ashley will be coming up on the stage, and if anyone does, they have
to deal with me!"
<p>Katie smiled in a way that made Nina hope no one messed with her.&nbsp;
"You get OFF the stage for any reason before your four hours are up, and
the deal is off.&nbsp; You get no help from me with Sarah.&nbsp; Agreed?"
<p>"How do we know we can trust you?" Nina said.
<p>"You don't!&nbsp; But then, what other options do you have?"
<p>Nina stared at Katie for a moment, before looking at Helen.
<p>Helen's eyes were wide and she looked scared, yet there was a determination
there to get this over with.&nbsp; "Let's do this," she said.
<p>Nina just wanted to leave; she felt hemmed in, trapped, but she was
out of options.&nbsp; She turned and mounted the stage, followed by Helen.&nbsp;
Neither of them saw Katie's satisfied smile.
<p>From up on the stage, the crowd of people looked huge in the confines
of the club, and all Nina could do was stop and stare.
<p>"You're supposed to be dancing!" Katie yelled at them, so Nina and Helen
began to move to the beat of the music, not doing much of anything except
shifting their bodies.&nbsp; The crowd near the stage began to pay attention
to them, and soon the young women were under close observation.
<p>Nina watched their eyes and got a shock.&nbsp; It was almost all women,
and Nina had hoped for some feminine sympathy from them, but for the most
part the looks on their faces were just like what she would expect from
a crowd of men in a similar situation.&nbsp; She knew this was a lesbian
bar, but still it was a shock.&nbsp; The interested looks seemed to bore
into her.
<p>"PUT SOME LIFE INTO IT!" someone yelled, and blushing, Nina made an
effort to dance better.&nbsp; She looked over at Helen who had turned around,
her back to the crowd.&nbsp; But Helen was soon urged to face the onlookers,
and her humiliation, once more.
<p>Suggestions were called out as to how to dance, and Nina began to comply,
even when most of those suggestions were for her touching herself provocatively
as she moved like some Michael Jackson video.&nbsp; When the crowd caught
on to the fact that both Nina and Helen would do whatever they asked, the
requests came at them faster and became a lot more suggestive.&nbsp; Nina
and Helen were told to dance together, to hold each other, to...touch each
other.&nbsp; Nina wondered if there was anything as bad as having to strip,
and thought maybe this forced intimacy might be it.&nbsp; She looked in
Helen's eyes as she placed her right hand on Helen's chest, and saw her
own confusion and misery reflected back at her.
<p>Then came the request she had expected, yet still not wanted to hear.&nbsp;
"TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF!"
<p>Nina and Helen both looked at the crowed, trying to pick out what woman
had yelled it.&nbsp; But the call was taken up by many, and the group now
collectively yelled for them to strip each other.
<p>Both Nina and Helen had conservatively dressed in long skirts and blouses,
hoping to avoid any sexual references while they danced.&nbsp; But it hadn't
really worked, and they hadn't really expected it to.
<p>"STRIP, STRIP, STRIP!" the crowd began to chant.
<p>"Who's first," Nina said to Helen, resigned.
<p>"You do me first," Helen said.
<p>"You sure?"
<p>Helen nodded and swallowed.&nbsp; So Nina began to undo the buttons
of Helen's blouse.&nbsp; The crowd cheered upon seeing this, and the chant
died down, although there were calls for both of them to keep on dancing,
so Nina and Helen tried to move to the music as they suffered.
<p>Neither of them were professionals, and neither had undressed another
under the condition they had to face that night, so Nina was understandably
all thumbs as she worked to undo the tiny buttons down the front of Helen's
blouse.&nbsp; As Nina unbuttoned, Helen's white bra came into view, and
the crowd loved it, whistling and catcalling like a bunch of drunken men.
<p>"DO HER SKIRT FIRST!" someone shouted, so Nina obediently moved to Helen's
hip and the zipper for the heavy wool skirt.
<p>"You ready?" Nina said to Helen, loud enough for only her friend to
hear.&nbsp; Helen just nodded, so Nina pulled the zipper down and tugged
on the skirt.&nbsp; It slipped down easily and Helen stepped out of it,
kicking it toward the back of the stage, out of reach of the crowd.&nbsp;
She stood stiffly in her mostly unbuttoned blouse, her legs now revealing
her pantyhose.
<p>Nina resumed work on Helen's blouse, and in moments, it was completely
undone.&nbsp; Nina hesitated, but at the urging of the crowd, she slid
it off Helen's shoulders and tossed it in back.&nbsp; She was told to continue.
<p>Nina looked out at the crowd and saw Katie smiling at her.&nbsp; With
her was Ashley in her abbreviated waitress outfit.&nbsp; Ashley didn't
look that happy, but gave Nina an encouraging smile.
<p>Helen's bra was a front closer, and Helen could feel herself shiver
with what she thought was excitement as Nina reached for the clasp.&nbsp;
She was mortified at having to stand there while being stripped by her
friend, yet at the same time she could feel a thrill that seemed to go
down to her most intimate spot.&nbsp; Helen was very confused.&nbsp; She
felt a sudden release in the pressure about her chest, and without looking
she knew her bra was undone.&nbsp; A sudden chill about her breasts, and
she knew they were bare.&nbsp; A tear welled up in one eye.
<p>Nina cast aside the bra; there were more whistles from the crowd, and
they began to chant again.&nbsp; All Helen wore now were her panties, pantyhose,
and shoes, and the crowd was eager for them to go.
<p>So Nina took a hold of the waistband and pulled down hard, bringing
down both panty and hose at the same time.&nbsp; She heard Helen gasp and
looked up.&nbsp; "I just want to get this over with," Nina said.
<p>Helen nodded and began to step out of the last of her clothing.&nbsp;
It all went to the back of the stage.
<p>Now Helen was completely nude, and the group wanted her to dance for
a minute.&nbsp; She did so, stiffly, her unease plain on her face, until
someone said it was her turn to undress the other one.
<p>Nina stood quietly as Helen turned to face her.&nbsp; Dressed much as
Helen had been, except for the fact she wore no hose, she was about to
feel what Helen had just experienced.
<p>Helen started on Nina's skirt, undoing the zipper and letting it fall
so Nina could kick it back.&nbsp; Then she took off Nina's shoes.&nbsp;
Nina was still pretty well covered by her long blouse though, and the crowd
was eager to see more.
<p>Helen stood in front of Nina, as if to hide her friend as she undid
the blouse.&nbsp; "I'm really sorry, Nina," Helen said.
<p>"You've nothing to be sorry for," Nina replied, and the friends shared
a smile.
<p>Helen was a bit more nimble fingered, and in moments the blouse was
undone, revealing Nina's pink underwear.&nbsp; Nina removed her own blouse
and tossed it in the back.
<p>Helen now had to move behind Nina, for her bra was a rear close.&nbsp;
She took several seconds to undo all the hooks, yet hesitated in removing
it.
<p>"TAKE IT OFF, TAKE IT OFF!" yelled the crowd, and there was a big cheer
when Helen pulled the bra away to reveal Nina's well-tanned breasts.
<p>Nina instinctively reached up to cover herself, but stopped.&nbsp; She
had gone naked before so many people since coming to live here that she
knew it was ridiculous for her to still be so shy, yet the atmosphere here
was such that it seemed so fresh.&nbsp; But there was one item yet to come.
<p>Helen decided to come around in front again, and she knelt to pull Nina's
panties off.&nbsp; Again she felt that odd thrill as she thought about
what she was doing, kneeling nude before Nina, about to render her friend
as naked as she was.&nbsp; It didn't make much sense to her, not to anything
she would admit to.&nbsp; Yet...
<p>She pulled down in one swift motion as Nina had done to her, and the
crowed cheered.&nbsp; Seconds later, both girls were on their feet again
and dancing, naked to the crowd.
<p>The suggestions started coming again, and again they started out tentative
and became more suggestive as time went on.&nbsp; Nina wondered how long
they had been up there, it had seemed like forever already, and as she
cupped her generous breasts at someone's request, she tried to see a clock.
<p>Movement behind her, and Nina whirled to see Ashley picking up their
clothes.&nbsp; Nina and Helen both rushed right over.
<p>"What are you doing?" Nina asked, trying to grab for her clothes.
<p>"Nina, please!" said Ashley, "I have to take them!"
<p>"No you don't, leave them here!" Helen said.
<p>"I can't...PLEASE!"&nbsp; Ashley looked scared and both Nina and Helen
relented.&nbsp; They were both lost, not at all in control of the situation,
and both wondered where it would lead.&nbsp; They watched in despair as
Ashley gathered their things and left the stage.&nbsp; Now they had nothing.
<p>The crowd was yelling at them to come back, so they did, and the suggestions
grew into orders that the girls tried their best to at least pretend to
follow.&nbsp; Some were outright lewd though, and both Nina and Helen faked
what they could, especially when penetration was involved.
<p>Then someone tossed Helen a big rubber dildo.&nbsp; "SHOVE THIS IN YOUR
TWAT!" someone yelled at her, and Helen just stood and stared at it.&nbsp;
The crowd began to chant, "DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!" and as if hypnotized,
Helen picked up the dildo.
<p>"No!" Nina said to her, but then she caught Katie's eye.&nbsp; Katie
was sitting at a nearby table and the look she gave Nina chilled her blood.
<p>Helen stood with the dildo for a long five minutes before she eased
it against her pussy.&nbsp; She began to rub herself with it, and the mob
went wild.&nbsp; Cheers were almost continuous now as Helen did herself,
while Nina stood to one side and watch in horrified silence.&nbsp; When
Helen actually pushed the dildo inside herself, the cheers grew even louder.
<p>More suggestions started coming, and Nina closed her eyes, for they
concerned the two of them.&nbsp; The crowd was calling for them to start
touching each other once more.
<p>Helen walked carefully over to Nina, her eyes wide, and the two of them
stared at each other.&nbsp; Nina didn't want to take this next step; she
couldn't, yet she couldn't stop Helen, who seemed to be operating on remote
control, from approaching her either.&nbsp; That first touch on her bare
breast made her shudder and begin to cry.
<p>Helen was in shock, all the excitement having gone now.&nbsp; She couldn't
believe that she was standing in front of all these people with a rubber
dildo in her pussy, and now she had the chance to do something she realized
she had wanted to do for a long time.&nbsp; Yet, now she didn't want it.&nbsp;
She didn't want to touch Nina; she didn't want to do the things the people
were telling her to do.&nbsp; But she couldn't stop herself, she felt like
she was just observing her body rather than controlling it as her hands
started to caress Nina's soft form.&nbsp; She could see that Nina was crying,
and knew that neither of them was getting any pleasure from this.&nbsp;
Even the dildo rubbing her sensitive spots felt like just a dull weight
inside her.&nbsp; Helen thought of Kevin, the nice guy she met on the boat
trip, and how he would feel if he knew what Helen was doing right now.&nbsp;
She felt very dirty.
<p>"KISS HER, KISS HER, KISS HER!" was the new chant.
<p>Helen and Nina moved together slowly, nipples touching, both in pain
from the humiliation, both in tears.&nbsp; Their faces drew close and both
could see in the eyes of the other the pain they shared.
<p>"I'm sorry," they both whispered at the same time, and their lips touched.
<p>"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!" yelled a single male voice, and the
crowd went silent.
<p>"James Barb, I presume," said Katie over the silence of the crowd.
<p>Nina looked over, it was Jim.&nbsp; He began pushing through the group
followed by the big bouncer.&nbsp; Katie waved the bouncer back.&nbsp;
"I'm glad to see you, James," Katie said.&nbsp; "How do you like our little
show?"
<p>Jim ignored her.&nbsp; Instead, he climbed up on the stage where the
two women still embraced, and approached them.&nbsp; He looked angry.&nbsp;
"What's going on, Nina?" he asked, looking at both of them.
<p>Nina explained quickly how Katie was going to help them, IF they did
as she wanted this night.
<p>"Are you crazy?" Jim said angrily.
<p>"It was the only way out for us!" Nina said.
<p>"I told you to ask her for help, but you should have told me about all
this!"&nbsp; He took Nina's chin in one hand, and his expression changed
to one showing a lot more concern.&nbsp; Nina could see that his anger
was fueled by his caring for her.&nbsp; "Nina, I love you, and if we are
to have a life together, then you have to let me protect you when I can.&nbsp;
You should have told me, you didn't have to do this."
<p>"I do, WE do," she answered.&nbsp; "We STILL do!&nbsp; Go away, Jim,
you can't help!"
<p>"Can't I?" he said, his anger back.&nbsp; He turned and walked over
to Katie.&nbsp; Nina and Helen didn't let go of each other, they didn't
dare move.&nbsp; Each hoped that Jim COULD do something, but didn't know
what.&nbsp; Both were also still reacting to the kiss and everything that
led up to it, or they would have if they hadn't been so numb with shock.
<p>They watched Jim and Katie walk to a far side of the bar, while the
rest of the patrons settled back to their own fun.&nbsp; Jim looked like
he was arguing with Katie, who remained calm and collected before the younger
man.&nbsp; Nina began to despair that Jim could do anything to help.&nbsp;
But then the attitudes of both changed.&nbsp; Jim grew calmer and was actually
smiling a little, while Katie looked more alert and more interested.&nbsp;
Soon the two shook hands and made their way back to the stage.
<p>"Get out of here, now!" Katie told them.
<p>"We can go?" Helen said.
<p>"Yeah, go now before I come to my senses and change my mind."
<p>"What about Sarah?" Nina said.&nbsp; She wasn't about to leave with
out that being resolved.&nbsp; She wasn't about to let this evening's humiliation
be for nothing.
<p>Katie looked at Jim for a moment before answering.&nbsp; "I'll take
care of her.&nbsp; I'll call in a few days with the details.&nbsp; In the
meantime, you do as she says, don't let on about our arrangement.&nbsp;
We'll take her as soon as we're ready.&nbsp; Now go!"
<p>Jim came up on stage.&nbsp; "Where are your clothes?" he asked.
<p>Neither Nina nor Helen knew where Ashley had taken them, and Ashley
wasn't around either.&nbsp; "Never mind, come on."
<p>They began to walk off the stage, and the sudden movement reminded Helen
about the dildo.&nbsp; Her face turning red, she pulled it from herself
and angrily threw it at the crowd who still watched the drama.&nbsp; A
woman caught it and licked it, eliciting a laugh and making Helen cringe.
<p>The two nude women and the young man left the club and climbed into
a car outside.&nbsp; Nina and Helen both climbed into the back and huddled
together, unwilling to separate despite what they had been forced to do.&nbsp;
On the drive back, they both started to cry, the emotional upheaval of
the evening finally catching up with them.
<p>Jim had planned to drop both of them at their homes, but he was no fool
and saw that neither of them were in any shape for that.&nbsp; So he did
the best thing he could think of, and drove to his parents' house.
<p>His mother was an instant help, and immediately pushed Jim aside once
he had quickly explained what Nina and Helen had been through.&nbsp; She
got the sobbing women out of the car and took them both upstairs to one
of the many bedrooms in their large home.&nbsp; Servants came and went,
but Jim was told to wait downstairs with his father.&nbsp; They sat in
silent communication.
<p>Eventually, Yvette came down and asked for Jim.&nbsp; "Nina, and the
other little one, they need you now," she said simply.
<p>"Thank you, Mother," Jim replied.
<p>"Your Nina, she is strong.&nbsp; The other...she will need a bit more
help.&nbsp; But both will pull through, especially when that horrible Sarah
Wickland is punished along with this Katie person.&nbsp; You will take
care of them, n'est pas?"
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; He made his way upstairs and found the room where
his love was in semi darkness.&nbsp; Both Nina and Helen were lying together
under the covers of the big bed.&nbsp; Separate, yet still holding hands,
not willing to be parted just yet.&nbsp; Both were more composed however.
<p>"You okay?" Jim asked.
<p>Helen nodded while Nina spoke.&nbsp; "We'll be okay.&nbsp; Your mother
is a saint!"
<p>Jim smiled.&nbsp; "Yeah, she's amazing.&nbsp; Look, I'm sorry I got
angry."
<p>"You had every right to be.&nbsp; What we did was stupid," Nina replied.&nbsp;
"But how did you get us out of it?"
<p>Jim looked uncomfortable.&nbsp; "Just a private deal between me and
Katie.&nbsp; You're not involved, and I plan to keep it that way.&nbsp;
Okay?" he said firmly.
<p>Nina nodded, so Jim got up.&nbsp; "I'll let you guys sleep, you need
the rest."
<p>"Jim!" Nina called out, so he stopped.&nbsp; "Please...don't go.&nbsp;
Don't leave us...not tonight."
<p>Jim looked startled.&nbsp; He glanced at Helen, who actually smiled
and said,&nbsp; "Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Jim Barb, all we
want is your company!"
<p>Jim chuckled, and after a moment so did Helen.&nbsp; Nina joined them
and tension was released.&nbsp; "Well," Jim said after a while, "you can
hardly blame me when I get an invitation like that from two beautiful nude
women in bed together!"
<p>Nina and Helen glanced at each other, as if only then realizing that
they were still nude under the covers.&nbsp; Then Nina grinned and moved
over so there was room in the bed on the OTHER side of her.
<p>"I guess so," Nina said, "since you men are all alike and think too
much with your gonads.&nbsp; But you're dreaming if you think something
like that will ever happen in real life, Mister!"
<p>Jim began to take off his shirt.&nbsp; "I know, but like you said, a
man can dream!"&nbsp; Once he was nude, he slipped into bed next to Nina,
and the three of them lay quietly for a while.
<p>"Can we trust her?" Nina said into the darkness.
<p>"Oh yes, we can now," Jim replied.&nbsp; He wouldn't comment further.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 31.

<p>Part 32, The Deal.
<p>The phone rang at Nina's desk and she picked it up without looking at
it.&nbsp; "Specialized Affairs, Nina West speaking!" she said.
<p>"Nina, it's Ashley," said the voice at the other end of the line.
<p>Nina sat up straight, her attention now fully on the call instead of
on her work.&nbsp; "Ashley," she repeated nervously.
<p>"It's on for this Friday night, Nina," Ashley said quietly.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "It's about time, I've been waiting three days for
you to call!"
<p>"Couldn't be helped, things had to be set up."
<p>"What things?&nbsp; What does Katie have planned?" Nina asked, curious
to know how Sarah Wickland's downfall would occur.
<p>"I...er...I can't tell you.&nbsp; What I'm supposed to tell you is that
you are to tell Helen to be ready for Friday night, and that Brian Cook
will have further details."
<p>"Brian?&nbsp; What does HE have to do with this?"
<p>"I can't tell you.&nbsp; But you are supposed to follow his instructions."
<p>This made Nina nervous.&nbsp; She didn't like being out of the loop,
especially where Sarah and Katie were involved.&nbsp; "Can't you tell me
anything?"
<p>"No, sorry," said Ashley rather sadly.&nbsp; "Just tell Helen, and keep
Friday night open."&nbsp; The girl hung up, and Nina looked at the phone.&nbsp;
She didn't know whether to feel happy or scared, a conflict she was coming
across with far too much regularity lately.&nbsp; She hung up the phone
and looked across the office to where Helen's desk was.&nbsp; It was empty,
Helen being in Donny's office for the moment.
<p>Her intercom buzzed.&nbsp; "Nina, come up here a moment will you?"&nbsp;
It was her boss, Sarah Wickland, the Legallady.
<p>Nina sighed and stood up carefully, looking down at herself and wincing.&nbsp;
She had been told by Katie to act as if nothing was going on, to do whatever
Sarah asked, so that Sarah wouldn't know there was a plot against her.&nbsp;
Easier said than done, but Nina had complied.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Monday in the office had started out with a confrontation.&nbsp; As
she had the week before, Nina showed up dressed for work.&nbsp; But rather
than let her have her way, this time Sarah was waiting for her.
<p>"Okay, you had your fun," she had said, standing with her hands on her
hips.&nbsp; "But it's over now.&nbsp; I want you to strip right now and
hand over those clothes.&nbsp; Things are going back to the way they were!"
<p>Nina didn't want to give up her new found freedom; besides, to give
in easily just might arouse suspicion.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; Sorry, Sarah, but
I won't."
<p>"Oh yes you will.&nbsp; I was grateful that you went and got help after
the accident, and got me out of the car.&nbsp; As a reward, I decided to
let you have your way last week.&nbsp; But enough is enough, and we have
to get back to work.&nbsp; We have clients coming in today, and they are
expecting my staff to act accordingly.&nbsp; So strip!"
<p>Nina shook her head.&nbsp; "Sarah, I've done a little digging, and there
is something I think you need to be aware of."
<p>"What?" Sarah said, folding her arms.
<p>"You do know that the fact Helen and I were in handcuffs was recorded
on the police record of the accident.&nbsp; Helen and I could take you
to court on the charge of reckless endangerment over something like that.&nbsp;
How would you like that kind of publicity?" Nina said, matching her pose.&nbsp;
"I doubt the Senior Partners would appreciate one of their own with a criminal
record, not to mention the Bar Association."
<p>The two women stood staring at each other while the office entrance
opened as Helen and Donny arrived together.&nbsp; The newcomers could see
right away that something big was going on.
<p>Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "Well done, Nina.&nbsp; Yes, well done.&nbsp; You
know, I've long thought what a powerful litigant you might make one day.&nbsp;
When it comes down to it, you aren't afraid to press the attack.&nbsp;
A handy skill in our profession.&nbsp; Wouldn't you agree, Donald?"
<p>Donny Bell looked from one woman to the other and stood a little straighter.&nbsp;
He smiled and agreed with the powerful lawyer.
<p>"Then I guess," Nina said, "the argument is settled.&nbsp; You leave
us alone, and we won't press charges."&nbsp; Inside, Nina felt ecstatic.&nbsp;
She didn't know why she hadn't brought this up before!&nbsp; Here she had
a way of stopping Sarah in her tracks without needing Katie at all!&nbsp;
She looked over at Helen and winked slightly, but Helen simply tried to
look small.
<p>The Legallady was still smiling, no sign of defeat on her face.&nbsp;
"I said you had promise, I didn't say you were there yet.&nbsp; Although
a few years under my tutelage would be very good for you.&nbsp; Still it
was a nice try."
<p>Nina frowned.&nbsp; "What do you mean, nice try?&nbsp; I WOULD press
charges, you know that!"
<p>"Oh I know you would, Nina.&nbsp; But it doesn't matter."&nbsp; Sarah
turned to Helen and ordered the girl to go up to the law library and bring
back a particular edition.&nbsp; While Helen ran upstairs, the two women
just stared at each other, while Donny watched from the sidelines.&nbsp;
Helen returned, and at Sarah's direction, she handed Nina the book.
<p>"Look up 'Valentine vs. Skyler'," Sarah said.
<p>Nina did, and saw it was a case set in their own State, and upon reading,
she saw it set a rather unusual precedent.&nbsp; "You've got to be kidding!"
Nina said after reading it.
<p>Sarah just smiled.
<p>"What does it say?" Helen asked, her own guarded hopes now dashed.
<p>"Apparently, two years ago, Sarah had a case like ours which she won,
setting a precedent that bondage among consenting adults in a moving vehicle
is not considered reckless endangerment in this State, as long as the driver
is unimpeded."
<p>"But we weren't consenting!"&nbsp; Helen said.
<p>"Yes," said Nina sadly, "we were.&nbsp; We're on record as saying that
Sarah wasn't kidnapping us, that the cuffs were nothing important.&nbsp;
We can't go back and change our stories now, not against this case."&nbsp;
She glared at Sarah.&nbsp; "You knew all along!"
<p>"Of course!" said the smug lawyer.&nbsp; "One thing you have to learn,
Nina, is never to do anything without knowing where it might lead, don't
ask a question you don't already know the answer to, and always...ALWAYS...be
thorough in your research."&nbsp; She grinned.
<p>"Bitch," Nina said, wiping the smile off Sarah's face.
<p>"Donald," she said, "I'm appointing you the Office Manager.&nbsp; Your
primary task is to maintain discipline in the office.&nbsp; You already
do a fine job with Helen, but feel free to take care of Nina too."
<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Donny said, looking at Nina.
<p>"Right now, Nina is violating her personal dress code for when she is
in the office; take care of it, will you?"
<p>Donny opened his eyes wide and nodded slowly.&nbsp; Sarah smiled, and
turned and walked away.
<p>"Nina?" Donny said, approaching her.&nbsp; "I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask for your clothes."
<p>Nina was standing stock still, focused on where Sarah had gone up the
stairs.&nbsp; She was angry at losing, but took comfort that what she lost
now would be regained soon.
<p>Wordlessly she began to undress.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since then, Nina had been back to coming to work naked and going home
the same way.&nbsp; In between, she had been subjected to Sarah's little
whims, her stabs at humiliation.
<p>For one set of clients, Sarah made Nina kneel by her desk, her knees
spread wide, facing them while lawyer and client talked.
<p>For another set, Nina had to go outside behind the building and watch
their dogs, all the while nervously looking around, not wanting to be seen.&nbsp;
At one point, she had to hold one of the Irish Wolfhounds close to her
when a car drove down the alley behind the office, and she still remembered
the feel of the animal's fur against her bare skin.
<p>Today, she actually had something on.&nbsp; Black lace stockings with
a matching garter belt.&nbsp; A push up quarter bra, also black, that framed
and presented Nina's breasts for all to see.&nbsp; And a pair of five-inch
heels that locked on with little padlocks and made Nina stagger around.&nbsp;
As Nina headed for the elevator to the second floor, she once again felt
worse than nude in the sluttish get up.
<p>Walking past Donny's office upstairs, she glanced through the door to
see the lawyer dictating a letter.&nbsp; On her knees beside the desk was
Helen, barefoot but otherwise fully dressed, and doing her best to stay
that way as she took down what Donny was saying.
<p>Nina entered Sarah's office, staggering slightly on the extra high heels.
<p>"Ah, Nina.&nbsp; Adjust the blinds for me again, will you?" Sarah said,
hardly looking up from her desk.
<p>Nina clenched her jaw, but did as she was asked.&nbsp; Sarah had had
her up for this meaningless task several times today already, and Nina's
feet hurt from all the walking.&nbsp; To make it worse, the controls for
the blinds were in the middle of the window, not the edge.&nbsp; So standing
and adjusting them meant showing herself to anyone outside who happened
to look her way.&nbsp; It was just one more of Sarah's little games.
<p>"You'll get yours, Sarah," Nina whispered under her breath as she bent
to her task.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It was now Friday night, and at home Nina got ready to go.&nbsp; She
had spent a miserable week catering to Sarah's needs, and was ready for
a bit of revenge.&nbsp; As she sat in her room and touched up her makeup,
she wondered what was planned for the evening.
<p>She had tried prying some information out of her boyfriend, Jim.&nbsp;
But he had remained closed mouthed about the subject, telling her instead
that he would be picking her and Brian up that night, after getting Helen,
who was also invited.
<p>Excited, the nude girl couldn't wait to find out what was in store for
her boss.
<p>She went downstairs to find Brian so they could go and get her outfit
for the night, and found the old man waiting for her in the lobby.
<p>"You look lovely, tonight!" he said, admiring the nude beauty as she
padded down the stairs.
<p>Nina blushed, but was genuinely happy about the comment.&nbsp; "Oh,
you'd say that to any naked woman you'd see," she said, joking.
<p>Brian chuckled.&nbsp; "Hardly, young lady.&nbsp; Few could compare."
<p>Nina blushed again and smiled.&nbsp; "Well, I'd feel more beautiful
after I get dressed.&nbsp; I think I'm putting on a few pounds."
<p>"Dressed?" Brian said.&nbsp; "You're not getting dressed.&nbsp; What
on earth put that idea into your head?"
<p>Nina stopped.&nbsp; "What do you mean I'm not dressing?&nbsp; Tonight
is about Sarah, not me.&nbsp; I have to get dressed!"
<p>Brian shook his head.&nbsp; "That isn't the plan I'm afraid, Nina."
<p>"Why can't I get dressed?" Nina asked, really concerned.
<p>"Because," said a voice from the front door, "I said you can't!"
<p>"Jim!" Nina exclaimed, and she hurried to meet him, kissing him softly.
<p>"Mmmm...you feel good!" he said, running his hands across her soft skin.&nbsp;
She slapped his hands away and blushed, looking over at Brian before looking
back at Jim.
<p>"Fresh!" she said in a dumb blonde accent, making him laugh.&nbsp; Then
she punched him in the shoulder.&nbsp; "Why can't I get dressed?&nbsp;
It's not because of that thing you have about never seeing me in clothes!"
<p>Jim grinned.&nbsp; "Well, there is that.&nbsp; VERY important."&nbsp;
He chuckled after seeing her pout.&nbsp; "But there is a better reason
for your staying nude tonight."
<p>"What is it?" demanded Nina, wondering what the excuse would be this
time.
<p>"We need to lull Sarah into state of well being, make her think that
she has nothing to worry about.&nbsp; You being nude will go a long way
toward making her more comfortable, so she won't know that SHE'S the target."
<p>"But what's going ON tonight!" Nina wanted to know.
<p>"Oh, not much, we're just going to a party!"
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Sarah Wickland was dining alone that night.&nbsp; In just a T-shirt,
she sat at home in her den, a plate full of pizza rolls by her side and
a tape with several episodes of 'TJ Hooker' in the VCR.&nbsp; She never
got enough of that show, and as she hiked up her shirt, she began to daydream
about William Shatner.
<p>Her reverie was interrupted by the phone.
<p>"Hello?" she said, annoyed.
<p>"Sarah, this is Katie.&nbsp; I hope I'm not interrupting anything!"
<p>"No, not at all," Sarah said, trying to put an air of boredom in her
voice while unconsciously pulling her T-shirt down.
<p>"Good.&nbsp; I was worried I might have ruined your plans for the night;
pizza rolls are SO hard to reheat!"
<p>Sarah flushed and swore silently.&nbsp; The damn woman knew her too
well.&nbsp; "It just so happens I am about to go out," she lied.
<p>"Well cancel it.&nbsp; I want you at my house as soon as you can get
here.&nbsp; I'm having a party and I need you to help equalize the sexes.&nbsp;
Way too many men!"
<p>"I told you, I had plans!" Sarah said angrily, not wanting to deal with
Katie right then.
<p>"Sure, your date.&nbsp; Well, you can put your lust for Bill Shatner
on hold for one night.&nbsp; Get over here, and wear something decent,
the Mayor's here!" Katie hung up.
<p>Fuming, Sarah put the phone down.&nbsp; Katie really did know her too
well.&nbsp; Still, an evening in the company of the Mayor and some of his
cronies wouldn't be that bad.&nbsp; There were a few people she wanted
to talk to regarding a couple of her current cases.&nbsp; It might be worth
the trip.&nbsp; Also, Sarah mused, with that kind of crowd, Katie wouldn't
try anything.
<p>What really decided it for Sarah though, was the unspoken knowledge
that Sarah really didn't have a choice.&nbsp; Katie called, Sarah would
respond.
<p>As she headed for her bedroom, she pulled off her shirt and thought
about what to wear.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The number and quality of the cars parked in the neighborhood around
Katie's home told Sarah that this was no ordinary party.&nbsp; The valet
who parked her car only confirmed this.&nbsp; So Sarah somewhat happily
entered Katie's home, when usually these trips filled her with dread.
<p>Upon entering, Sarah saw that the cars outside well reflected the people
within.&nbsp; Along with the Mayor, she recognized a State Senator, two
Congressmen, three millionaire industrialists, plus a host of other moneyed
people.&nbsp; Of course, finding people with money in this town wasn't
at all hard, but still Sarah was impressed.&nbsp; She even spotted two
of her fellow Senior Partners, and talked shop for a moment before a waitress
served her a drink.
<p>Sarah almost didn't catch who the waitress was, for she wore a mask
that went with her brief but still decent uniform.&nbsp; It was only when
the girl spoke that Sarah recognized the voice.
<p>"Helen?" Sarah said, looking sharply at the girl.
<p>Under her mask, Helen colored.&nbsp; "Yes, Ma'am," she said.
<p>Sarah grabbed her arm and moved her where they could talk without being
overheard.&nbsp; "Helen, what are you doing here?" Sarah asked.
<p>"Serving drinks, Ma'am!"
<p>"Don't be smart.&nbsp; What are you doing here?" Sarah asked angrily.
<p>The masked girl sighed.&nbsp; "Katie told me to come, and you know Katie."
<p>Sarah DID know Katie.&nbsp; Then she noticed something else.&nbsp; She
had grabbed and pulled Helen's left arm, and now it looked like the sleeve
had half separated from the shoulder of her uniform.&nbsp; Sarah took a
closer look.&nbsp; The uniform was black so it was hard to tell, but Sarah
saw that the sleeve hadn't been sewn on.&nbsp; Instead, tiny pieces of
Velcro had been used to hold it together.&nbsp; Examining the outfit, Sarah
could see that the whole thing had been designed to be held together that
way.&nbsp; An outfit like this would take just a second to rip from Helen's
body.&nbsp; Sarah smiled.&nbsp; "I DO like the outfit."
<p>Helen looked down.&nbsp; "It's Katie's idea of fun, we all have to wear
them."
<p>"All?"&nbsp; Sarah asked.
<p>Helen inclined her head toward the far end of the room where another
girl in an identical outfit stood by a door.&nbsp; Two more girls served
drinks in the middle of the room.&nbsp; "That's Ashley by the door, I don't
know who the other girls are," Helen said.&nbsp; "Nina is here as well,
she gets to serve the private party in the other room."
<p>Sarah looked up at the door Ashley seemed to be guarding.&nbsp; From
experience, Sarah knew that Katie like to set a room aside for her more
distinguished guests, sort of a party within a party.&nbsp; Only those
Katie deemed special were allowed to attend.&nbsp; Given who was out here,
whoever was in there was special indeed!
<p>"Who's in there?" Sarah asked.
<p>Helen shook her head.&nbsp; "I can't tell you."
<p>Sarah leaned forward.&nbsp; "Listen girl, I can have this outfit off
you in less than a second and you know it.&nbsp; So unless you want to
run from the room naked and screaming, you're going to tell me who is in
there!"
<p>Helen looked her in the eye, fear and defiance evident.&nbsp; "Go ahead!&nbsp;
Whatever YOU do, I know Katie would do worse!&nbsp; I'm not afraid of you
any more!"
<p>For a second Sarah was tempted, but she knew that to cause such a fuss
right now might stop her from meeting the elite in the other room.&nbsp;
She had been dazzled by the accumulated heavy weights out here, but now
she had set her sights on bigger game.&nbsp; "I'll see you at work," Sarah
said, "bright and early...and naked, just like Nina.&nbsp; You don't defy
me!"
<p>Sarah saw Helen shake a little, and she let the young paralegal go.&nbsp;
She had bigger fish to fry.&nbsp; She started toward the far side of the
room, pausing to touch base with a few individuals along the way, people
she would have spent hours with given normal circumstances.&nbsp; When
she reached the door to the other room, she saw that it was indeed Ashley
standing next to it, even under her mask.&nbsp; Sarah grinned, for the
rear of Ashley's skirt was missing, which was why the girl stood with her
back pressed against the wall.
<p>"Hello, Sarah," Ashley said with a grin.&nbsp; "Recovered from your
spanking yet?"
<p>Sarah Wickland glared at her.&nbsp; "Be careful girl, I can have the
rest of that outfit off you in a second."
<p>Ashley's smile faded quickly.
<p>Sarah smiled and reached for the door, but Ashley blocked her.&nbsp;
"I'm sorry, you're not on the list."
<p>"What do you mean, list?" Sarah asked.&nbsp; "Since when do I need to
be on a list?"
<p>"What's in there isn't for you, Sarah," Ashley replied slowly.
<p>"I'll be the judge of that," Sarah said, trying to push past.
<p>"Wait!" said Ashley, as a bit more of her outfit came loose under the
strain.&nbsp; "Look, I'll go in and get Katie, okay?&nbsp; You can talk
to her!"
<p>Sarah paused, then nodded.&nbsp; She watched as Ashley opened the door
and slipped in, catching only a brief glimpse of what was inside.&nbsp;
But it was enough, for while she saw a lot of people, her eyes instantly
focused on one of them, Nina.&nbsp; And from the look of her, she had lost
rather more of her outfit than Ashley had.
<p>Sarah grinned.
<p>After a moment, Katie appeared at the door, coming out so Sarah couldn't
see past her into the private room.&nbsp; "Ah, Sarah, it was good of you
to make it," she said.&nbsp; "Are you having a good time?"
<p>"As good as can be expected, Katie dear," Sarah replied, acid dripping
from her words.
<p>"That's nice, dear.&nbsp; So glad.&nbsp; So why don't you go mingle,
and I'll see you later."
<p>"Of course, but I was wondering who you had hidden away in your private
room?" Sarah asked casually.
<p>Katie smiled.&nbsp; "Really?&nbsp; Well, no one important, you needn't
concern yourself.&nbsp; There are plenty of people out here for you to
talk to.&nbsp; Now, I must go.&nbsp; Mingle, mingle!"
<p>"But..." said Sarah.&nbsp; But Katie just smiled and passed through
the door.
<p>Annoyed, Sarah tried the door handle but found it locked.&nbsp; She
couldn't believe it.&nbsp; Now she knew Katie was up to something, and
Sarah was determined to find out what!&nbsp; She stormed through the room
to the front entrance, hardly making way for anyone in her fury.&nbsp;
As she passed Helen, who was serving a drink, Sarah grabbed the back of
the girl's outfit and pulled down hard, stripping poor Helen to the waist.&nbsp;
The sound of Helen screaming and the puzzled cheers from some of the men
in the room warmed Sarah's heart as she left the building.
<p>Sarah wasn't leaving Katie's home, though, she had other plans.&nbsp;
Stepping outside, she looked for the valet and waited until he left his
post to go park a car.&nbsp; With no one watching the front of the large
house now, Sarah slipped off her shoes and padded along the side of the
house on the lawn.&nbsp; She couldn't get too close to the house, for rose
bushes had been planted next to the walls, but she didn't need to.&nbsp;
In seconds, she was at the corner and out of sight of anyone out front.
<p>"I'll show her," she mumbled.&nbsp; "No one important indeed.&nbsp;
Who does she think she's trying to fool?"
<p>Sarah carefully worked her way around the house in the dark, to where
she knew the windows to that particular room would be.&nbsp; She wanted
a look inside to see just whom Katie was keeping her from.&nbsp; She got
to the windows, but encountered a problem.&nbsp; The roses.&nbsp; Katie
had planted them to discourage burglars by making access to the windows
more difficult.&nbsp; This stopped Sarah for a moment, and she was thinking
about trying something else when she heard laughter from inside the room.&nbsp;
The thought that she was missing out on laughing with the elite only spurred
her on, and she began to push her way into the roses in an effort to reach
the window.
<p>Now, what Sarah Wickland was wearing at the moment was an evening gown
designed to be looked at and fawned over by men; it wasn't designed for
urban assault.&nbsp; Also, roses, being roses, are not the best things
to try to push through in an evening gown, because of a handy little self-defense
feature that nature gave them a long time ago.&nbsp; Thorns.
<p>It didn't take long for Sarah to begin getting caught, and she spent
as much time reaching around herself to get some point unsnagged as she
did pushing toward the window.&nbsp; At one point, one stocking clad foot
began to sink in something very soft, and Sarah wondered if the roses had
been watered recently.&nbsp; She awkwardly tried to keep her balance as
she strained to look into the window.
<p>There, she could see in.&nbsp; Many people were visible, almost all
men, although she could see one other woman apart from Katie and Nina.&nbsp;
Sarah grinned.&nbsp; Nina had indeed lost much of her waitress uniform,
for apparently all that was left was a bit about her waist.&nbsp; It was
annoying though, because most of the men had their backs to the window
or were sitting behind obstructions, so while Sarah knew they were there,
she couldn't see enough of them to recognize them.&nbsp; She did recognize
Brian Cook, that head of hair was hard to miss, and Sarah wondered what
he was doing here.
<p>"FREEZE!" a voice yelled behind her, making Sarah jump.
<p>"What?" she said, turning to see who was yelling at her.
<p>"I SAID 'FREEZE, DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE!'"
<p>Sarah didn't listen.&nbsp; "Who are..." was all she got out when someone
tackled her.&nbsp; Sarah screamed as hands grabbed her and began hauling
her out of the rose bushes.&nbsp; Her screams were accompanied by ripping
cloth as her dress was caught in the thorns.
<p>Sarah wriggled and kicked, but her assailants were too strong for her.&nbsp;
They wrestled her to the ground and rolled her over onto her front.&nbsp;
The cold wet ground told Sarah that much of her dress was no longer with
her.&nbsp; She began to swear as her hands were forced behind her and cuffs
put on them, calling them names and threatening to sue.&nbsp; She heard
one of them talking into a radio of some kind.&nbsp; "Base 1, this is Unit
3.&nbsp; Suspect has been apprehended!"&nbsp; Rough hands pawed her body,
again telling Sarah how little of her dress remained.&nbsp; She figured
she was left in not much more than her underwear.&nbsp; "Suspect is unarmed,
Base 1," continued the voice.
<p>"Make sure the suspect is restrained and bring her in, Unit 3," came
the reply.
<p>"Roger!"
<p>Sarah struggled to be heard.&nbsp; "Now wait a minute!&nbsp; What the
hell is going on?"
<p>"SHUT UP!" yelled the voice in her ear; "We don't take kindly to spies!"
<p>"Spies!" Sarah said.&nbsp; She was hauled to her feet, and finally saw
that the men who had grabbed her were dressed in battle dress uniforms,
or BDU's.&nbsp; They were all armed.
<p>"What...?" Sarah said again as they all took a look at her underdressed
body.&nbsp; "I wasn't spying...I'm not a spy!"
<p>"Ma'am, we got you dead to rights looking in that window," said one
of them, apparently the officer in charge.&nbsp; "If that ain't spying
I don't know what is!"
<p>"I wasn't spying!" Sarah tried to yell, feeling more and more confused.
<p>"Yeah, right.&nbsp; Okay squad, let's get her back to Base 1.&nbsp;
Someone there can strip search her for hidden microphones and all that
other James Bond crap."
<p>"Don't look like she has many places to hide much, LT," one of the other
men said with a laugh.
<p>"Doesn't take much, Sergeant.&nbsp; But I know if they dig DEEP enough,
they'll find something, they usually do!"
<p>"NOOOOO!" yelled Sarah, now very scared.&nbsp; "I'm not hiding anything,
honest!"
<p>"Well that's for them to find out, Ma'am.&nbsp; Are you going to walk,
or are we going to have to drag you?"
<p>"KATIE!" Sarah yelled.
<p>"Say, LT," yelled another of the men, "I heard that some of these spies
hide weapons and shit in their underwear!"
<p>"No kidding?" said the man they called LT.&nbsp; "Well, I guess we'd
better strip her to make sure she carries nothing dangerous on her!"
<p>"KATIE!" Sarah yelled again, struggling to get free, while the lawyer
part of her brain figured out how to sue the U.S. Government over this
breach of her civil rights.
<p>The men moved in, and in seconds sharp knives had reduced what she had
left for clothing to tiny rags scattered on the ground around them.
<p>"Simpson!" yelled the LT, "police this area!&nbsp; The rest of you,
pick her up and let's get going!"
<p>"KATIE!" Sarah yelled once more, now dressed in nothing but a pair of
handcuffs.
<p>The men all reached for her.
<p>"WHAT'S ALL THE NOISE OUT HERE!" yelled a voice from the window.
<p>"KATIE!" Sarah yelled, hearing her friend's voice.
<p>"Sarah?" Katie called.
<p>The LT stepped forward.&nbsp; "Nothing to be afraid of, Ma'am, just
dealing with an intruder."
<p>"I know that woman," Sarah heard Katie say.
<p>"You do, Ma'am?" replied the LT, "Then perhaps you can identify her
for us for the arrest record.&nbsp; Save us some time while we prosecute
her for spying!"
<p>"Spying?" echoed Katie.
<p>"KATIE, I WASN'T SPYING!" Sarah yelled at the top of her voice.&nbsp;
"FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL THEM THAT!"
<p>"What was she doing?" Katie asked casually.
<p>"We caught her looking in the window, Ma'am.&nbsp; And given our mission
tonight, we had to assume the worst."
<p>"I see, of course," Katie said agreeably.
<p>Sarah was being held with her back to the house, and couldn't see the
shit-eating grin on Katie's face, or the smile on the face of the man known
as LT.&nbsp; She also couldn't see the faces pressed against the window,
the "Elite" guests she had been so anxious to find out about.&nbsp; Most
of them were smiling too.&nbsp; Sarah herself was too scared and humiliated
to figure out how ludicrous the situation was.
<p>"Katie!&nbsp; Tell them I'm not a spy, TELL THEM!" she yelled.
<p>"Sarah dear, you've been a very naughty girl," replied Katie.&nbsp;
"Peeking in windows.&nbsp; Is that how ladies behave?"
<p>"Katie, quit with the jokes, this is serious!" Sarah yelled.
<p>"I asked you a question, Sarah!" Katie said sternly.
<p>Sarah stopped struggling.&nbsp; "What?"
<p>"I asked you if ladies peek in other people's windows!"
<p>"N...no," Sarah said, only now suspecting that things weren't as they
seemed.
<p>"That means you're not a lady, doesn't it, Sarah.&nbsp; It makes you
a naughty little girl.&nbsp; What are you?"
<p>Sarah swallowed.&nbsp; Nude, cuffed, afraid because Katie was using
THAT tone of voice.&nbsp; "A...a...naughty...little girl."
<p>"I thought so," Katie said, as if confirming the most obvious thing
in the world.&nbsp; "She's no spy, Lieutenant, just a naughty little girl
peeking in windows."
<p>"Are you vouching for her, Ma'am?" asked LT.
<p>"Sure.&nbsp; Bring her around the side door and I'll take her off your
hands.&nbsp; But don't worry, I'll make sure this naughty little girl is
punished."
<p>Everybody but Sarah grinned.
<p>"Sure thing, Ma'am.&nbsp; But I'd better come along to make sure," said
the LT.
<p>"Of course!" replied Katie, and she closed the window.
<p>Sarah was led around the side of the house and to a door she knew fairly
well.&nbsp; Still nude and cuffed, she was hurried down a hallway until
she came up against another door which Katie opened from the inside.&nbsp;
Sarah had gotten her wish; she had joined the private party.
<p>Now she could see who was attending and she gasped.&nbsp; There was
Brian Cook sitting in an armchair near the fire.&nbsp; Standing next to
him was Jacob Dah.&nbsp; In a love seat nearby sat young Jim Barb, and
curled up next to him, still nude, was Nina.&nbsp; The woman turned out
to be the Head Mistress from Cronenburg, who happened to have been one
of Sarah's teachers when she and Katie attended the school.&nbsp; Sitting
next to her was Franklin, who licked his lips at the sight of his naked
boss, and next to him sat Donald Bell.&nbsp; Several other men from her
life, ex-lovers for the most part, were also present, and by the door stood
Helen and Ashley.
<p>That left only one.&nbsp; Sitting alone in another armchair was her
father.
<p>"Hello, Dad," Sarah said weakly.
<p>Harry Wickland looked at his daughter.&nbsp; She was naked, covered
in dirt from when she was thrown to the ground, and to his eyes a disgrace.&nbsp;
He shook his head.&nbsp; "What am I going to do with you, Bunny," he said,
using her baby name.
<p>Sarah flushed.&nbsp; "It's Sarah, Dad, not Bunny."
<p>"When you start acting like an adult, then I'll use your proper name!"
Harry said harshly.&nbsp; "But since you continue to act like a little
girl, being mean and spiteful and selfish, then I will continue to call
you Bunny!&nbsp; Understood, girl?"
<p>Sarah bowed her head.&nbsp; "Yes, Sir."&nbsp; Sarah didn't know if it
was parental programming or what, but she had never been able to stand
up to her father when he used that tone of voice.
<p>Harry looked at her sadly.&nbsp; "I'm glad your mother can't see you
now."
<p>Sarah felt a little smaller, and continued to look at the carpet.&nbsp;
She felt hands at her wrists and the cuffs were removed.&nbsp; She resisted
covering up.
<p>Katie moved around her to get a better view of the action.&nbsp; "BUNNY...here,
was a naughty girl tonight," she said with a smirk.
<p>"I'm quite aware of that, Kate," Harry Wickland said, "You don't need
to rub it in.&nbsp; You're worse than my daughter at times, girl.&nbsp;
Don't think I don't rue the day you and she met."
<p>"If you hadn't had sent her to Cronenburg, we never would have, Harry!"
Katie snapped back.
<p>"Much good it did her," mumbled Harry, looking at the school's representative.
<p>"Sarah was a hard case," said the Head Mistress, "you know that.&nbsp;
She spent more than half her school term under discipline.&nbsp; I don't
think it shamed her much at all.&nbsp; I have often thought it a pity that
for girls like her we couldn't extend Cronenburg discipline into their
adult lives."
<p>A lot of people nodded.
<p>"I'm sure we can think of something," Katie said.
<p>Sarah looked up.&nbsp; "What's going on here?"
<p>"You've been a naughty girl...BUNNY," giggled Katie, "and now we get
to watch you get punished!"
<p>"What?" said Sarah, but then she saw her father patting his knee.&nbsp;
"No!"&nbsp; Sarah said.
<p>"Come here, girl," said Harry.
<p>"No, not here, not now!" Sarah said, backing up.
<p>"I said, COME HERE!"
<p>"No!"&nbsp; Sarah knew what was about to happen, her father was going
to spank her.&nbsp; In front of all these people, her FATHER was going
to give her a spanking, just like she was a naughty little girl.&nbsp;
She backed up until strong hands grabbed her from behind.
<p>"I got her, Sir," said the man called LT.
<p>"Bring her here, Son," said Harry.
<p>From her seat, Nina watched the man in BDU's manhandle Sarah across
the room.&nbsp; Nina was fascinated by what had happened this evening.&nbsp;
She hadn't been thrilled to play the part of the waitress in front of all
these people, and unlike Helen and Ashley, she hadn't been given a full
uniform to start with.&nbsp; But she only had to do it while Sarah was
in the house, and she got to watch with everybody else as the fake soldiers
outside caught Sarah looking in the window...just as Katie predicted she
would.
<p>Now Nina got to snuggle with Jim as the second part of Sarah's humiliation
for the night was about to happen.&nbsp; Katie told Nina that a hidden
camera was taping all this so it would be preserved for posterity.&nbsp;
Nina looked forward to getting hold of that tape.
<p>Sarah now stood next to her father, and she actually appeared to be
crying.
<p>"Please, Dad, not here," she said.
<p>"Bunny, it's for your own good, you know that," he replied.
<p>"Not here, not in front of them!" Sarah begged.
<p>"You've made fools and tormented most of the people in this room, Bunny.&nbsp;
When Kate called me and asked me to participate in this, I refused at first,
but when she said that it was not for her but for THESE folk...well, I
couldn't say no.&nbsp; You need taking down a peg or two, Bunny, and this
is the best way to do it."
<p>"Please...please..." Sarah whispered, tears coming down her cheeks.
<p>Harry took her hand and gently, almost tenderly, pulled her over his
lap.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Harry Wickland was gone now, as was LT and most of the people in the
room.&nbsp; At Katie's request, a few had stayed for one final act.&nbsp;
Jim and Nina were still in their seat, Donald in his, with Helen by his
side.&nbsp; Brian Cook was still in his chair, and Ashley stood by the
door.
<p>On the floor, sitting on a rug by the fire, was Sarah Wickland.&nbsp;
She stared at the flames, emotionally drained from the humiliation of being
spanked like a child in front of these people.&nbsp; Her buttocks still
hot enough to fuel her anger.&nbsp; Her mind was still shell-shocked, but
a small part of her was already planning on how to get back at every one
of them.
<p>Katie wasn't in the room at the moment; she was seeing to the departure
of her other guests, all whom knew nothing about the little drama played
out around them.
<p>The door opened and Katie stepped into the room, preceded by a large
black dog of indeterminate breed.&nbsp; The dog seemed friendly enough
though, it wagged its tail, and its face expressed a good-natured, if slobbery
attitude.&nbsp; It sniffed its way into the room and most smiled at it.
<p>Sarah looked at the dog in horror.
<p>"Bruno," said Katie, "be nice!"
<p>Bruno shook his head, slobber going everywhere, and gave the room one
of those famous doggy grins, before resuming his search.&nbsp; As he approached
Sarah, she cringed.&nbsp; He began sniffing her bare crotch.
<p>"Ah, he remembers you!"&nbsp; Katie said with a smirk.
<p>Sarah looked daggers at her and pushed the dog away.
<p>Untroubled, Bruno wandered over to where Nina sat and collapsed in front
of her, rolling onto his back to get his tummy scratched.
<p>Smiling, Nina obliged.&nbsp; She used one shapely bare foot to tickle
him.
<p>Katie walked to the center of the room.&nbsp; She looked at each person
in turn; catching their eye and holding it before moving on.&nbsp; It seemed
that she held Jim's eye for just a little bit longer, and it seemed that
Jim appeared to nod slightly before Katie moved on.&nbsp; She walked to
where she could address the group as a whole.
<p>"I want to thank you all for coming tonight," she said, "It was quite
enjoyable.&nbsp; But I have some good news, and some bad news."
<p>This got peoples' attention and they all looked at her.
<p>"The good news is that the video of tonight's events came out nice and
clear.&nbsp; There will be no forgetting THIS night!"
<p>"Bitch," Sarah said from the floor.
<p>"Look who's talking!" Katie told her, and Sarah went red.
<p>"What's the bad news?" Donny asked.
<p>"The bad news is for you, I'm afraid.&nbsp; And for Nina and Helen as
well," replied Katie.&nbsp; "I'm not going to give you what you came for.&nbsp;
You're not going to get any proof of what happened here tonight."
<p>"We had a deal!" Nina said, standing up.&nbsp; "You were going to help
us!"
<p>"Oh I am, I am.&nbsp; But not the way you expected," Katie said.&nbsp;
"Now sit down.&nbsp; SIT DOWN!"
<p>Nina stared at her for a moment, before Jim reached up and took her
hand, pulling her back down into her seat.&nbsp; At her feet, Bruno snored.
<p>Katie sighed.&nbsp; "I'm keeping all the tapes, all the proof, right
here.&nbsp; There's no need for you to have it in your possession.&nbsp;
I'm also keeping this...!"&nbsp; She plucked from a nearby shelf a large
envelope that no one had really noticed.&nbsp; She pulled from it a familiar
looking videotape and some documentation.
<p>"That's the stuff on us!" Donny exclaimed.
<p>"Where did you get that?" demanded Sarah.
<p>"From your safe, of course," Katie said with a smug smile.&nbsp; "The
Lieutenant's team might not be military, but they have their uses."
<p>Sarah glowered at her.
<p>"The reason I'm keeping both," continued Katie, "is so neither of you
can use this information against the other arbitrarily.&nbsp; I won't have
any vengeance blackmail going on here.&nbsp; Instead, you're going to agree
to a deal."
<p>"What deal?" asked Nina.
<p>"It's quite simple really, Nina.&nbsp; YOU finish out your apprenticeship
with the firm in Sarah's office, before moving on to law school and bigger
and better things.&nbsp; You follow your CURRENT office rules of course,
and otherwise stay out of trouble."
<p>"What?&nbsp; You mean I have to keep going to work naked?" said Nina
angrily.&nbsp; "That's why I asked for your help in the first place!&nbsp;
To stop doing that!"
<p>"No," said Katie, shaking her head.&nbsp; "You wanted me to stop Sarah
from humiliating you further.&nbsp; To make her back down and stop being
cruel.&nbsp; Well, that is HER side of the deal.&nbsp; I hear of anything
happening to you beyond simple office discipline, and I'll release the
video of tonight's events to people who could wreck her career.&nbsp; If
you DON'T go back to work like I asked you, Nina, I release YOUR information,
destroying not just your life, but also Donald Bell's here.&nbsp; Got that?"
<p>Nina stood stunned.&nbsp; She thought that after tonight she would be
free.&nbsp; But instead...instead...&nbsp; She looked at Jim.&nbsp; "What
do I do?"
<p>"Nina, you told me once that you admired Sarah, that she was the kind
of lawyer you wanted to be.&nbsp; Is that still true?" he asked her.
<p>Nina nodded.
<p>"Do you think you can still learn from her?" he asked.
<p>"Yes, I do."
<p>"You also told me that you didn't find the basic nudity at work that
bad.&nbsp; That if it wasn't for Sarah's increasing cruelty, it would actually
be somewhat fun working naked.&nbsp; Right?"
<p>Nina blushed at having such a secret revealed.&nbsp; But she nodded.
<p>"Well then, Katie is making sure that Sarah will no longer be cruel,
while giving you the opportunity to mentor under Sarah Wickland.&nbsp;
Can you live with that?"
<p>Nina looked at him for a moment, then she looked over at Sarah.&nbsp;
"Yeah, I can live with that.&nbsp; Okay, I'm game."
<p>Katie looked at Sarah too.&nbsp; "Ball's in your court, Honey, what
do you say?"
<p>Sarah didn't look at any of them, but she nodded.&nbsp; "Fine.&nbsp;
Nina's protected.&nbsp; Office rules, that's all.&nbsp; But I expect her
complete cooperation when it comes to clients' needs."
<p>"Okay," Nina said, and everybody sighed with relief.&nbsp; All except
Helen, who stood up.&nbsp; "What about me?&nbsp; What's to stop her from
taking things out on me!" she said, close to tears.
<p>Nina walked over to her and hugged her.&nbsp; "Helen has to be included
too," Nina said to the room.&nbsp; "She has to be protected as well."
<p>"Sarah?" Katie said.
<p>"Fine, but only if she follows the same rules as Nina does.&nbsp; If
they both want your protection, they both live by my office rules!" said
Sarah, straightening up.
<p>Helen bit her lip and looked into her nude friend's eyes.&nbsp; Then
she nodded.
<p>Katie clapped her hands.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; It's all settled.&nbsp;
Starting Monday, both girls will be working under Nina's rules, and Sarah
can't go any further than that with them.&nbsp; I think that covers everything.&nbsp;
Good job, people!"
<p>"Can we go now?" Nina asked.
<p>"You can go," Katie replied with a grin.
<p>Sarah got up and moved quickly out of the room; she was still nude but
didn't care.&nbsp; She found her car and drove home.
<p>Donny took Helen and Brian home, and Jim gave a ride to Nina.
<p>"You okay?" Jim asked her as they got in the car.
<p>"Yeah, just a little bummed."
<p>"It will be fine, I promise you," he said.
<p>"It worked out good for you, didn't it!" she said.
<p>"For me?"
<p>"Well yeah.&nbsp; Now I have to be nude almost all the time!&nbsp; At
work, at home, whenever I'm with you.&nbsp; Are you ever going to let me
get dressed around you?"
<p>Jim smiled.&nbsp; "Tell you what, I'll let you wear a wedding dress
when we get married."
<p>Nina narrowed her eyes at him.&nbsp; "What makes you think we're getting
married?"
<p>"Just a hunch," he said with a smile as he leaned over her.
<p>An hour later, the car windows all steamed up, a breathless female voice
could be heard to say,&nbsp; "Yes, yes...I'll marry you!&nbsp; Now stop
licking me there...PLEASE!"
<p>The car began to rock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>End of Part 32.

<br>
<p>Part 33, Six Months Later.
<p>"I can't believe it," said Helen, brushing a piece of lint from Nina's
dress.
<p>"Can't believe what?" Nina asked, looking at herself critically in the
mirror.
<p>"You and Jim, going all this time without him ever seeing you in clothes,"
Helen answered.&nbsp; "If you had told me six months ago that you guys
would have managed that, I would have just laughed."
<p>Nina smiled softly.&nbsp; "Well, it wasn't easy, let me tell you.&nbsp;
There were many times I was so angry with him that I wanted to dress in
front of him and break the streak."
<p>"Oh yeah," giggled Helen, "remember the donkey?"
<p>"I'd rather not," replied Nina, who still couldn't laugh about THAT
day, even though it had been several months ago.
<p>"I know there were times you could easily have ended it as well!" said
Helen, who knew when to change the subject.
<p>"Yeah."&nbsp; Nina smiled, thinking back.&nbsp; "There were times when
I actually had to work at staying naked for him.&nbsp; A year ago I never
thought I would have purposely avoided wearing clothes for someone."
<p>Helen nodded, and both women grew still.&nbsp; "It's a pity it has to
end," Helen said.
<p>Nina smiled.&nbsp; "Well, it IS our wedding day."
<p>It was.&nbsp; Helen sat back and admired her friend in her pure white
wedding dress.&nbsp; An IO creation, it gave the impression of gossamer
lightness while at the same time sleekly showing off Nina's figure.&nbsp;
Lace fringe outlined her body and bust, and Helen was one of the very few
that knew what little secrets the wedding dress held.&nbsp; Nina's breasts
actually pushed through cutouts in the front of the dress, after being
fitted individually with silk 'socks' that covered them like a second skin.&nbsp;
Her breasts could be uncovered easily by one simple tug of the material,
and Nina found the possibility to be thrilling.&nbsp; Also, the fringe
right at the front hid the fact that her nipples were not covered at all!&nbsp;
One merely had to brush the fringe away to reveal those coral tinted nubs.
<p>It was a dress designed to put the wearer in a state of heightened excitement,
and on Nina it worked.&nbsp; She brushed the front of it once more, looking
at herself in the mirror.
<p>Helen checked her watch.&nbsp; "It's almost time, Brian will be up soon
to get you.&nbsp; Shall we get your veil on?"
<p>Nina nodded and stood still so her friend could place it on her head.&nbsp;
Nina saw that the veil was huge!&nbsp; A single piece of fine lace, that
flowed into the lines of the dress, right down to the train.&nbsp; A white,
silk covered ring was pinned to it, and this in turn was to be pinned to
her head like a crown.
<p>Nina let her friend finish dressing her, thinking about her life, about
Jim, about her family, about her past and her future, and about what she
was doing now.&nbsp; This was such a big step, and she knew that what she
felt was simply wedding jitters, something all brides faced.&nbsp; Yet...
<p>"There," Helen said, "finished.&nbsp; You look perfect."
<p>They both stared at Nina's image in the mirror.&nbsp; "Do I?" Nina asked
eventually.
<p>Helen looked at Nina, and the swell of organ music started nearby.&nbsp;
Music for the guests that were now entering the church where the wedding
was going to take place.
<p>"Of course you do," Helen said softly, "you're a beautiful bride.&nbsp;
I hope to look half as good as you when Kevin and I get hitched next year."
<p>"Has he asked you yet?" Nina said with a small smile.
<p>"He will, although I might have to send him an invitation to his own
wedding soon if he doesn't!"
<p>Helen laughed, but Nina just smiled.&nbsp; She looked once more at her
image in the mirror.
<p>"What's up, Nina?" asked Helen.
<p>Nina sighed.&nbsp; "This is wrong, I can't do this," she whispered.
<p>"What's wrong?" Helen asked quietly.
<p>Nina flapped her arms once in frustration.&nbsp; Then she took her veil
off and stared at it.&nbsp; Turning to face her Maid of Honor, she said,
"Will you help me?"
<p>"You know I will," Helen replied.
<p>Nina nodded.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>James Barb stood waiting in the church, in position and in control,
or so he wished.&nbsp; Actually, he was as nervous as hell, even though
he had no doubts that he was doing the right thing.&nbsp; He loved Nina
and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.&nbsp; It was that simple.
<p>Standing with his Best Man in their assigned positions, he looked about
the church at the gathering throng.&nbsp; It seemed to Jim that his side
of the church was filling faster, with friends and family of not just him
but his parents too.&nbsp; His mother and father had places of honor at
the front, and both smiled in encouragement as he tried not to pace.
<p>The other side of the church was filling with Nina's friends, but the
seats reserved for family remained bare.&nbsp; Jim knew that the situation
between Nina and her parents was not a good one.&nbsp; Neither of them
approved of Nina's decision to come out here, of her association with her
grandfather's friends, or her desire to become a lawyer.&nbsp; Jim couldn't
understand their hatred of Alex West, a hatred they couldn't let go of
even now that the man was dead.&nbsp; A hatred that had also possibly cost
them their daughter.&nbsp; They were not coming out for the wedding, but
Jim had hoped they would change their minds, so he made sure seats were
set aside for them across the aisle from his own parents.&nbsp; But they
had not shown up.
<p>Still, it wasn't as if Nina had no one.&nbsp; Brian Cook had been delighted
to be asked to give her away, and Jim's own parents loved her like a daughter
already.&nbsp; Yvette and Nina had grown so close that at times Jim found
himself a little jealous of their secret smiles.
<p>At one point not too long ago, his father had remarked that Nina was
a lot like Yvette at that age, and that Yvette might be what Nina could
grow old to become.&nbsp; Jim had pondered the Freudian meanings behind
THAT for a while.
<p>For probably the twentieth time in the last ten minutes, Jim asked his
Best Man about the ring.&nbsp; After which he looked to the back of the
church, wondering what was holding things up.&nbsp; Apparently, they were
not ready yet, but since some people were still showing up, he wasn't sweating
it yet.
<p>He had to think of sweat.&nbsp; He could feel it itching under his armpits,
and he tried to find a more comfortable way of wearing his grandfather's
tuxedo jacket.&nbsp; He could easily have afforded his own tuxedo, but
his grandfather had passed it on to his dad for luck when he married Yvette,
so Tom Barb now passed it on to his son for the same reason.
<p>Jim sighed.
<p>He spotted a signal being given and the music changed.&nbsp; A wave
of expectation flowed through the crowd as Jim eyed them one more time.&nbsp;
He saw Katie sitting with Sarah Wickland, both dressed beautifully and
acting a lot more friendly than they had in the past.&nbsp; He saw Mrs.
Terry, Brian's housekeeper, who had pretty much taken over planning the
wedding as if Nina was her own daughter, and they were glad to have her.&nbsp;
He saw Kelly and Christopher, the twin grandchildren of Brian Cook.&nbsp;
Kelly looked strange in clothes, and Jim grinned as he caught her eyes.&nbsp;
She smiled back.&nbsp; He saw people Nina worked with, Donald Bell being
one, who was there with his family.&nbsp; Many faces Jim recognized as
being clients Nina saw regularly as a paralegal under Sarah Wickland.&nbsp;
More faces he didn't recognize at all.&nbsp; It was a very good turnout,
and Jim was happy.
<p>The flower girl walked the aisle first, Donny's young daughter with
a big smile on her face.&nbsp; Next came a bridesmaid, Ashley, looking
lovely in her sky blue dress.&nbsp; Helen followed, and to Jim she looked
as nervous as he felt.&nbsp; She glanced back once, but then locked her
eyes on the front of the church.
<p>When Helen took her place, the organist began the 'Wedding March' and
all turned to look for the appearance of the bride.&nbsp; The music played
for almost a half minute with no appearance of her though, and a murmur
of voices began to emerge from the gathered.
<p>Then, from behind the arched doorway at the back of the church, Brian
appeared, and as he moved, he brought forward a vision in white.
<p>It took several seconds for the crowd to register what they were seeing
though, and with the possible exception of maybe Helen and Brian, every
adult mouth dropped open.
<p>Brian led Nina down the aisle, his face red, his own disbelief evident
in his expression, for Nina was no longer wearing her very expensive wedding
dress.&nbsp; All she wore was her veil, which Nina had adjusted so that
it fell evenly around her entire body.&nbsp; It could hardly have been
counted as clothing though, for Nina was plainly visible.&nbsp; She had
let her hair down, and it cascaded over her shoulders, but that was all
the covering she had underneath the transparent veil.&nbsp; Her own expression
was a mix of shock, fear, and determination as Brian led her to the altar.&nbsp;
He passed her on to Jim and went to sit down; unable to believe what Nina
had done and hoping he could capture it in stone some day.
<p>Other members of the congregation were a little more vocal in their
surprise, and voices rose.&nbsp; Some even stood, as if unable to handle
what they were seeing by sitting down.&nbsp; A few even left the church
rather than be a part of it.
<p>The people Jim had hired to videotape the event were very focused on
their job.
<p>Nina moved to stand next to her husband-to-be, and looked him in the
eye.&nbsp; Jim saw her courage, her love, in what she had done.&nbsp; He
knew he had put her through a lot during their courtship in his quest to
see just how long they could go before he HAD to see her dressed.&nbsp;
He was amazed at the lengths they went to at times, and fully appreciated
the effort Nina put into their little game.&nbsp; Still, he hadn't expected
this at all, and he saw it for the declaration of love that it was.&nbsp;
By coming out here nude, in front of all she knew and all who knew her,
she was showing a commitment to him that could not be broken.&nbsp; Jim
was overwhelmed.
<p>He looked at her face and saw something else too, a questioning look,
as if she was seeking his approval for what she was doing.&nbsp; He smiled
and nodded slowly, and her face began to radiate with the most beautiful
smile he had ever seen.&nbsp; At that moment, they both knew that whatever
else might happen, they were together...forever.
<p>"This...this is highly irregular," said the priest, Father Brown.&nbsp;
"Young lady, you cannot be married like this.&nbsp; Go get dressed at once!"
<p>Nina and Jim turned to look at him, and Jim felt his anger build, spoiling
his moment of pure happiness.&nbsp; "Father," he said, "you ARE going to
marry us.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what Nina wears or doesn't wear, it doesn't
matter what you or anyone else might think of this!&nbsp; By doing this,
Nina has shown me a love that I guarantee you will never see again.&nbsp;
No other couple that comes before you will ever be as committed to each
other as we are, and God himself would be happy to bless our union.&nbsp;
Marry us, Father Brown, and send us on our way!"
<p>The crowd in the church had all froze upon hearing Jim's speech, and
the priest stood silent, mouth agape.&nbsp; A single person clapping got
his attention, and Nina and Jim turned to see whom it was.
<p>It was Jim's mother, standing in her silk gown and applauding, a smile
on her face.&nbsp; His father got up and joined her, adding his own applause
and nodding to his son and new daughter-in-law.&nbsp; Helen and Ashley
started clapping, and in moments many others stood and added their support.&nbsp;
It didn't take long for almost the entire congregation to stand and show
that they too wished the wedding to continue, and both Nina and Jim were
moved to tears.&nbsp; They stared into each other's eyes and shared the
moment by holding hands.
<p>Eventually, the priest nodded and waved the group to silence.&nbsp;
He took out his little book, opened it, and began.
<p>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here..."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---***---
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The reception was held next door in the elegant church hall, and most
came.&nbsp; People sat at table, visiting as people do during these events,
but most of the talk was about Nina's amazing appearance.&nbsp; While caterers
served the food and drink, people could talk of little else, and many men
were chastised by their female companions when their talk grew too crude
or intimate.
<p>It didn't help that Nina was also in the hall, doing her duty as the
blushing bride by visiting each table.&nbsp; And blushing she certainly
was under her veil, which she still wore despite it hiding nothing at all.&nbsp;
But Nina was also all poise and elegance, and answered the oft repeated
question as to why she was naked the best way she could.
<p>Her answer puzzled most, but those who knew her well understood perfectly.
<p>Jim was also doing the tour, and every so often they would meet and
touch, sharing a moment together and longing to be alone with the other.&nbsp;
Most saw this for what it was, and a few of the cruder said how they couldn't
blame Jim for wanting to be alone with his new wife.&nbsp; Again, a few
thumps were given out by the fairer sex.
<p>At one point, after some rather embarrassing speeches were given by
Helen and Jim's Best Man, Jim and Nina met in the middle of the room and
shared a brief kiss.
<p>"You holding up?" he said quietly to her, aware that they would get
no privacy until they left.
<p>"I'm holding," Nina replied, taking strength from his concern.&nbsp;
"I think I have only a dozen butterflies left in my stomach."
<p>Jim chuckled.&nbsp; "You know, you could go get dressed if you wanted!"
<p>"What, and ruin our record?" Nina said with a raised eyebrow.
<p>Jim grinned.&nbsp; "Well, if you put it like that.&nbsp; But I want
YOU to know that I'm not holding you to it.&nbsp; If you feel you want
to get dressed, go do it.&nbsp; You won't be disappointing me; I won't
be mad at you."
<p>Nina held him tightly.&nbsp; "Thank you.&nbsp; And one day I'll take
you up on that.&nbsp; But I think I'm going to be okay today."
<p>"You sure?" Jim asked.
<p>Nina looked up.&nbsp; "I love you, James Barb, and I___,"
<p>There was a sudden pull on the veil, accompanied by a loud ripping sound.&nbsp;
Nina felt a draft on her back and buttocks that told her that her minimal
covering was now even more minimal.&nbsp; She whirled around to see what
happened.
<p>A catering assistant, with her back to Nina, was standing stock still
on the trailing edge of what had been Nina's beautiful veil.&nbsp; A gaping
hole had been ripped in the fragile material when the caterer had stood
on it.
<p>Slowly, the woman turned to face the bride, her face, framed by blonde
tresses, showed a rather sheepish embarrassment.
<p>"OH...MY...GOD!" yelled Nina.&nbsp; "JENNY!&nbsp; What the FUCK are
you doing here!"
<p>"Er...hi Nina, it's good to see you again...er...sorry about your...er...dress?"
<p>Nina was livid, seeing red.&nbsp; She thought she was done with the
blonde disaster area known as Jenny.&nbsp; The last time Nina had seen
her was on TV, on those nude commercials for Mermaid Seas shampoo.&nbsp;
She did not expect to see Jenny in the flesh ever again!
<p>"Get out!" Nina growled.
<p>"What?" said the confused blonde.
<p>"GET OUT!" yelled Nina, reaching out and grabbing Jenny's obviously
too small caterer's blouse.
<p>There was a big ripping sound, and Jenny was rendered topless in nothing
flat.&nbsp; She had been unable to wear a bra under the tight uniform shirt.
<p>Jenny screamed and tried to cover her ample assets with both arms, allowing
Nina to reach for her shorts.&nbsp; Nina missed though, because Jenny managed
to dance out of the way just in time.&nbsp; She started to run, pushing
through the crowded hall toward the door, and Nina gave pursuit.&nbsp;
All Nina could think of was the satisfaction she would get in ripping the
dumb blonde's shorts off, and she forgot completely about her own nudity.
<p>Both women plowed across the hall and out the door, onto the street
outside, where Jenny kept running with a partially veiled Nina closing
in on her.
<p>Standing at the door of the hall, with as many people who could fit,
Jim watched the chase with a smile on his face.
<p>Helen, standing next to him, shook her head.&nbsp; "It's amazing how
they keep coming together," Helen said.&nbsp; "Just think of the odds against
them meeting again!"
<p>"Oh I don't know," Jim said, "sometimes the odds need a bit of a hand."
<p>Helen looked at Jim suspiciously.&nbsp; "Wait a minute, Nina told me
YOU hired the caterers."
<p>"Yep!&nbsp; And it took a while to find just the right ones," Jim replied,
winking at Helen.
<p>Helen couldn't help smiling.&nbsp; "She's going to kill you when she
finds out, you know."
<p>Jim grinned as he watched the two practically nude women chase each
other up and down the street.&nbsp; A police car went by, its lights flashing.&nbsp;
"Oh I don't know, she forgave me for the donkey.&nbsp; Shall we have some
cake?"
<p>Helen grinned.&nbsp; "Why not."&nbsp; They turned and went inside.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The End.

<p>Mermaid Thoughts
<p>The house was set well back from the road, and screened from the front
by a hedge about five feet high.&nbsp; The hedge effectively hid the entire
front yard but not the house itself, which rose in architectural splendor.&nbsp;
It was a modern home, full of glass and unusual angles, and looked as expensive
as it was.&nbsp; It was obvious that the residents had money, but then
that wasn't in dispute for no one in this neighborhood was really poor.&nbsp;
Some, however, were less poor than others.
<p>A gate blocked the driveway and anyone visiting the house had to stop
and buzz an intercom on a pole to gain entry. A man had stopped to do just
that, and as he waited for someone to answer he read a sign posted on the
gate.
<p>"This house and its grounds are a clothing-optional environment.&nbsp;
If the existence or thought of such an environment offends you or causes
any difficulty, you are quite free to go away and call us on the phone
and conduct your business that way instead.&nbsp; If you choose to enter,
then do so with an open and nonjudgemental mind!&nbsp; Oh, and beware of
the dog!"
<p>The visitor raised an eyebrow after reading the unusual warning and
chuckled.&nbsp; His boss had warned him about this before he came here,
so he wasn't worried.
<p>"Hello?" said a female voice from the intercom.
<p>"Hi," replied the visitor, "I'm Arthur Dino from Western Telly Productions."
<p>"Hello?" said the voice again.
<p>The visitor leaned further out his window.&nbsp; "My name is Arthur
Dino!&nbsp; I'm here to talk to Nina West!"
<p>There was a moment of silence before the voice informed him that there
was no Nina West living there.
<p>Arthur Dino blinked.&nbsp; Then he remembered something.&nbsp; "I'm
sorry, I meant Nina Barb, she's married now."
<p>"Ah!&nbsp; Miss Nina.&nbsp; Yes, yes, she lives here," replied the voice.
<p>"Then can I see her?" Dino asked after a moment.
<p>"Miss Nina is not here."
<p>Dino stifled a groan, it had been a long drive.&nbsp; "Well, I am expected.&nbsp;
Is her husband home?"
<p>"Yes, yes.&nbsp; Master James is home," said the cheerful, if slightly
strange, voice.
<p>"Can I see HIM?"
<p>"Please wait, I'll go ask."
<p>Dino settled back in his seat and sighed.&nbsp; He hoped he wasn't on
a wild goose chase, but his bosses at the home office in L.A. had thought
it was a good idea for him to make his pitch in person.
<p>"Did you read the sign?" asked the voice suddenly.
<p>"Yes, I read the sign," Dino replied.
<p>"You may come in.&nbsp; Park in front of the house, please."
<p>"Thanks," he called out, as he saw the gate start to open.&nbsp; Once
it had swung clear, he drove his car up the curving driveway to the front
of the beautiful home.
<p>Dino was impressed by what he saw, it was well kept and looked as though
it was tended by a loving hand.&nbsp; He was especially taken by a statue
standing on a low pedestal in the middle of a small pool.&nbsp; The way
the nude figure stood, tight yet exposed, nervous yet excited, showed the
skill of the sculptor.&nbsp; Whoever it was he had captured feelings rarely
brought out in any art Dino had seen before.
<p>He stopped the car and got out, eyes on the statue, so he didn't notice
the tall young man and his dog coming out of the house; not until the man
spoke that is.
<p>"Mr Dino," said the man, "I'm James Barb."
<p>Dino turned to look at the young man and noted the casual slacks and
polo shirt that he wore.&nbsp; Dino was actually surprised, having thought
that he would see the man naked as was warned on the sign out front.&nbsp;
He blinked and then stepped out from around his car.
<p>"Hi, Arthur Dino," he said, extending his hand, "I'm glad you were able
to see me."
<p>Jim took his hand and they shook, "Well, you sounded like it was important,
and we had the time.&nbsp; What can we do for you?"
<p>Dino looked around.&nbsp; The dog, a big yellow mutt, was sniffing at
his heals but didn't look menacing.&nbsp; Otherwise Dino saw no sign of
Nina.&nbsp; "Well, my business is really with your wife, is she about?"
<p>"Nina is running a quick errand, but she should be back any minute,"
Jim replied.
<p>Dino nodded, "Good, good, then perhaps we might wait."
<p>Jim didn't look like he liked that idea, but he decided to be gracious
and go along for the moment.&nbsp; "Alright.&nbsp; In that case would you
want a drink while we wait?&nbsp; We can sit out here on the terrace until
Nina gets back."
<p>"That would be fine, thanks," Dino said, "anything cold and wet will
do."
<p>Jim smiled and directed him toward some ornamental metal patio chairs
on a nearby terrace, before poking his head inside the front door.&nbsp;
"Dee," he called out, "could you bring out a couple of beers?"
<p>"Yes, Master James," answered the same voice that Dino had heard on
the intercom.
<p>Jim settled next to Dino, the dog lying down nearby, and traded a moment
of small talk before Dee appeared with a tray in one hand upon which two
glasses of beer were balanced.
<p>Dino's eyes nearly popped out, for other than a maid's hat on her head,
Dee was nude...very nude...rather more nude than the average nude person
could get.&nbsp; For Dee had to have at least a hundred pounds on him and
Dino considered himself a big man.&nbsp; The sight of all that uninhibited
flesh though, made him gasp.
<p>Jim smiled inwardly, knowing the effect his housekeeper had on new people.&nbsp;
No one expected to see a three hundred pound, fifty year old nudist; but
he knew that naturism was favored by all kinds of people, not just the
pretty or young ones, something that most people forgot.
<p>Dino, with his mouth still partly open, took the beer that was offered
to him and chugged down a mouthful.
<p>Dee handed Jim his beer and stood back, giving Dino a patient look.&nbsp;
"Will there be anything else, Master James?" she asked primly.
<p>"Not right now, Dee. Thanks," Jim replied, catching her eyes and giving
her a smile.
<p>"Then I'll get back to my ironing," said Dee, giving Jim a sly smile
in return, before heading back inside.
<p>Dino waited until she was gone before speaking, "I'm sorry.&nbsp; I
read your sign, but I wasn't...well...expecting..."
<p>"It's okay," Jim said, and it was.&nbsp; He and Dee both knew that she
would be getting strange looks from some of the visitors that came through
their gate, but Dee was prepared to be stared at and even, in some perverse
way, enjoyed how uncomfortable it made some people.
<p>Dee had been working for Jim and Nina ever since their wedding, and
had been a wedding present of sorts from Mrs. Terry.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry worked
for Brian Cook, Nina's former landlord, and also spent her time home completely
nude.&nbsp; Dee was a good friend of hers who had secretly practiced a
nudist lifestyle for years, before coming out at a nude beach only a year
before.&nbsp; Mrs. Terry fixed her up with the housekeeper's position at
the Barb house because she thought it would be good for her friend.&nbsp;
It was.&nbsp; Dee, rather nervous at first, had found acceptance and friendship
at her new job and enjoyed working for Jim and Nina immensely.
<p>Jim was rather proud of her and Nina was very fond of Dee, she was worth
her weight in gold!
<p>Jim was curious about Arthur Dino's reason for coming though, but waited
patently while the two men made small talk.&nbsp; Whatever it was the man
wanted, Jim knew there would be no pressure to take him up on anything.
<p>It was as they were finishing their beers that the gate at the end of
the driveway opened once more.&nbsp; Walking through it was a woman in
white carrying a canvas bag in one hand.
<br>Her clothing, if you could call it that, was a diaphanous white poncho-like
affair that was semi-translucent in the afternoon sun.&nbsp; Her body was
visible underneath the outfit and it was clear she wore nothing else, yet
enough detail was obscured to make the outfit close enough to the legal
definition of clothing.
<p>Dino was amazed that the woman had been brave enough to walk around
the neighborhood like that.&nbsp; Then he recognized her as Nina, and he
smiled.
<p>Nina wasn't smiling, although her face was flushed from the four block
walk from Brian Cook's house to her own.&nbsp; It was rather nerve-racking
walking around in something so revealing and she had been given more than
her share of interested looks.&nbsp; That she made the journey like this
several times a week didn't make it any easier.&nbsp; Once, just to see
if it was any better, she had gotten Jim to allow her to make the walk
in a bikini instead.&nbsp; The bikini Jim provided for her though left
almost nothing to the imagination and seemed worse than being nude.&nbsp;
It was at times like this that Nina regretted letting her husband take
over her wardrobe and deciding what she wore and when.&nbsp; Yet she couldn't
stop him because he always seemed to make it so worthwhile.
<p>Her smile faded at the sight of the car in the driveway.&nbsp; She always
found it hard to appear in front of unexpected visitors.&nbsp; But then
she remembered that this man with Jim WAS expected.&nbsp; She walked up
to the terrace and stopped.
<p>"Hi," she said.
<p>"Nina, this is Arthur Dino," Jim said, smiling at her.
<p>Dino stood up and held out a hand, "I'm from Western Telly Productions,"
he said, his eyes trying to make out her shape under the outfit.
<p>"Oh," Nina said, putting down her bag, "you're the people that made
those commercials I was in."
<p>"Yes, for Mermaid Seas hair products," said Dino.
<p>Now Jim remembered where he had heard the name before.&nbsp; "I see,
I liked those commercials a lot!"
<p>Dino smiled, "Most people do, which is why I'm here."
<p>"Sure," said Jim, waving a hand before turning to his wife, "but first,
why don't you get comfortable, Nina, and then we can hear what our visitor
has to say."
<p>Nina blinked, knowing Jim was going to say that to her.&nbsp; She saw
the amused glint in his eye and smiled.&nbsp; It was an unspoken house
rule that Nina wore nothing at home that would hide her body.&nbsp; Jim
had somewhat taken over the established rule of her constant home nudity
that she had lived under while staying with Brian Cook, her elderly landlord,
and Nina didn't really mind.&nbsp; Jim enjoyed playing games with her nudity,
pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in mixed company, what SHE
was prepared to do, and at times even what was LEGAL to do.&nbsp; Often
Nina found herself embarrassed because of something her husband had fixed
up.
<p>Undressing before this visitor, for that was what "getting comfortable"
meant, was tame compared to some things she had done since first meeting
Jim.&nbsp; So, with slightly trembling hands, Nina grabbed the hem of her
garment and lifted it over her head, exposing her well tanned, lightly
muscled body.
<p>Dino blinked yet again as the beautiful Nina revealed herself to him,
and shifted in his chair to adjust his pants.&nbsp; He had seen her topless
before, of course, in the commercials she had done almost a year ago.&nbsp;
But seeing her now in the flesh, so to speak, was another matter entirely.&nbsp;
To stop staring at her he picked up his briefcase and opened it.
<p>Nina carefully set her gown to one side and sat on one of the chairs.&nbsp;
The hard metal groves in the seat felt very odd to her nude butt, but she
was somewhat used to it.&nbsp; She crossed her legs and attempted to smile
pleasantly at Arthur Dino who looked a bit flustered.&nbsp; She exchanged
an amused look with her husband.
<p>"You said those commercials brought you out here, Mr Dino?" she asked.
<p>Dino nodded and kept his eyes on the paper in his case rather than on
the delightful pair of breasts in front of him.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; You see,
I'm here, at the bequest of my superiors, to make you an offer."
<p>"An offer," Jim repeated flatly.
<p>"Yes...er.&nbsp; Actually, it was our client, Mermaid Seas, Inc., who
made the initial offer to us.&nbsp; You see, the Mermaid Seas campaign
has been extremely successful, especially with their sponsoring of that
reality show on the 'Home Showcase' network.&nbsp; The commercials you
did, Nina, in the Angel Isles, succeeded far better than had been anticipated.&nbsp;
Sales of that rather obscure product have rocketed and now Mermaid Seas
is a household word!"
<p>Nina blushed, "I know.&nbsp; I'll sometimes get stopped in the street
or a client will mention that they have seen the commercial."
<p>"A client?" Dino asked, confused.
<p>"Nina's a paralegal at a local law firm," Jim said with a proud smile.
<p>"I'm sorry," Dino said, waving his hand as if to indicate their surroundings,
"I didn't think you...well..."
<p>"Worked?" Nina said with a smile.&nbsp; "Of course I don't need to,
but I want to.&nbsp; Just because we have money, that doesn't mean we shouldn't
contribute, right?"&nbsp; In fact, Nina was still adjusting to the fact
that her young husband was truly that rich.&nbsp; In some ways it troubled
her having such an easy life available to her, and she was determined to
make her own way; hence her continuation of her work as a paralegal and
her going to law school at the beginning of the next school year.
<p>"Yes, you're right," Dino said, "forgive me.&nbsp; It's just that we
would like you to come back and make some more commercials for us.&nbsp;
We want you to be the Mermaid Seas mermaid again."
<p>Nina shook her head, "I'm sorry, I'm really not interested."
<p>"Not interested?" questioned Dino, "But you ARE the mermaid.&nbsp; Your
face is what sells the product!"
<p>"My face?" Nina said with a chuckle, knowing that it was more probably
the fact that she did the commercials topless.
<p>"This time, we're even going to put you on the label, not to mention
personal appearances," Dino said.
<p>"Personal appearances?" Nina responded.&nbsp; "I assume that would mean
my appearing...in costume?"
<p>"Well..." Dino said, blushing.
<p>"No, I don't think so," Nina said firmly.
<p>Jim decided to make his thoughts known at this point. "I don't know,
it could be fun for you," he said.
<p>Nina looked at him, horrified.&nbsp; "You can't be serious!"
<p>"Well, maybe I am.&nbsp; I liked the commercials you did, and I get
a kick out of having such a famous wife."
<p>"Oh you'll get a kick in a minute," Nina replied.
<p>Jim chuckled.
<p>Dino looked from one to the other and figured his best hope was to convince
Jim to convince Nina.&nbsp; "Mr Barb, Nina is already established as the
Mermaid Seas mermaid and to put another actress in the role would not be
the same.&nbsp; We have actually tested this in select markets and to be
honest, people responded better to Nina than anyone else!&nbsp; She IS
the mermaid!"
<p>Jim looked at his wife for a moment, remembering how she looked in her
mermaid costume - sexy as hell!
<p>"I'll tell you what," he said to Arthur Dino, "give us a little time
to talk about it."
<p>Dino watched them both very carefully, relieved yet well aware that
a maybe didn't automatically mean a yes.&nbsp; He looked at Nina once more.&nbsp;
"Is that okay with you?" he asked.
<p>Nina bit her lip, then nodded.
<p>Dino sighed and took out his card, handing it to Jim, "Thank you, we
all thank you.&nbsp; When you make your decision you can contact me using
any of the numbers on this.&nbsp; But while I remember, I'm hoping you
could help me in a related matter."
<p>"If we can, what is it?" asked Jim.
<p>"There was another girl involved with one of the commercials who also
tested rather high.&nbsp; We lost track of her but I was told you and she
were friends.&nbsp; Do you know where I could find Jenny?"
<p>Nina groaned.
<p>---***---
<p>Jim and Nina were naked in bed together, both lying on their backs,
their fingers and toes touching.&nbsp; The moon was up and its light shone
through a crack in the curtains across their bedroom window.&nbsp; It cast
a white line across Nina's stomach, showing a slight sheen of sweat that
was the remnant of their recent love-making.&nbsp; Now they were both in
that afterglow, relaxing in each other's company in a way only lovers,
true lovers, can.
<p>After a little while, Nina sighed.
<p>"Penny for your thoughts," Jim whispered in the darkness.
<p>"Oh, nothing really," she replied.
<p>"I doubt that very much," said her husband, turning over to look at
her.
<p>Nina let her eyes drift down his body, the moonlight now catching his
hip.&nbsp; She reached out and traced it with her fingers.
<p>"Are you worried about the Mermaid Seas offer?" Jim asked her quietly.
<p>"A little.&nbsp; Do you really want me to do it?"
<p>"Don't you want to?"
<p>Nina paused, thinking and feeling.&nbsp; She rolled to face him. "It
was fun making those commercials, even though I was stuck in that suit
for more than a day.&nbsp; But..."
<p>"But?"
<p>"Well...I want to be a lawyer, and I'm famous enough right now being
the mermaid for Mermaid Seas.&nbsp; If I do more commercials that will
only perpetuate the situation and I don't see that helping my legal career."
<p>Jim chuckled, "I see what you mean.&nbsp; Can you imagine taking on
a client who remembers you in your cute mermaid costume?"
<p>"Oh yeah, knowing that the guy has seen me topless on TV will do wonders
for my credibility," Nina groaned, "not to mention what any judge I go
before might think!"
<p>"Oh I don't know.&nbsp; I'd be inclined to listen more to a woman like
you if I had seen her topless," Jim said with a grin, brushing one of her
breasts with the back of her hand.
<p>"Stare at her you mean," Nina snorted.
<p>Jim chuckled, "Well, I doubt it would hurt your career if you continued
to work for Sara."
<p>"Oh God, PLEASE don't wish that on me," she replied, smiling and shaking
her head.
<p>"I thought you liked it there?" Jim said.
<p>"I do...but...I don't know if I want to continue dealing with the weird
clients she gets.&nbsp; What I wouldn't give for someone normal!"
<p>"Normal like us, you mean," Jim said firmly.
<p>Nina gave him a look, "I'd hardly call us normal, Dear.&nbsp; What other
husbands keep their wives' clothes under lock and key?"
<p>"Only the ones who care enough to keep their wives at their most beautiful,"
Jim replied with a smile.
<p>Nina chuckled and touched his cheek, "I don't know why I put up with
you and your games."
<p>Jim lifted a leg and laid it across her stomach, pushing her onyo her
back, "Because you know it's worth it," he replied, as he moved over to
kiss her.
<p>---***---
<p>Nina dreamt.
<p>She was out in the ocean, the shore a distant line on the horizon.&nbsp;
She could feel her legs encased in rubber, a mermaid's tail that she whipped
back and forth in order to stay afloat.
<p>It was daylight yet she could feel bright lights behind her and when
she turned she saw they came from a boat.&nbsp; There were lots of men
on the boat, all staring at her and filming her with cameras and Nina only
then realized she was nude from the waist up.&nbsp; She wanted to cover
herself with her arms but she couldn't, she had to swim.
<p>A voice was shouting, "Say the tag line, the TAG line!"
<p>Nina knew what it was the voice wanted, but she couldn't talk.&nbsp;
When she tried, a high pitched scream was all she could manage.
<p>The voice got angry and started jeering at her, and Nina found herself
being bombed with shampoo bottles.&nbsp; She turned and started swimming
away from the boat, heading towards the shore.&nbsp; It looked miles away
but in only moments she was there, crawling up on the beach.
<p>The sand was warm and dry and Nina wanted nothing more than to collapse
and sleep, but she wanted to get her mermaid suit off first.&nbsp; The
trouble was, she couldn't find a fastener.
<p>Men were suddenly surrounding her on the beach, which now looked like
a swimming hole she went to as a kid back home.&nbsp; The men were all
staring at her and again Nina tried to cover up while fighting with her
tail.
<p>Voices talked about her, how none of them had ever seen a real mermaid
before.&nbsp; Someone said they should capture her and the men moved in
closer.
<p>Nina tried to talk, to tell them to go away but again all she can do
is screech like a dolphin.&nbsp; She felt hands grasping her, mauling her
and she tried to break free.&nbsp; But it was useless and she couldn't
stop them from picking her up.&nbsp; One man had his hands firmly on her
breasts and grinned at her as he began to squeeze...
<p>Nina woke up suddenly, a surge of adrenaline pumping through her, almost
panting due to the rush.
<p>Her senses came back to her almost immediately so she knew she had been
dreaming, but remnants of the dream stayed with her and it took a moment
before she could relax.
<p>She still felt the hand on her breast though, but when she looked down
she saw it was just Jim, one arm thrown across her as he slept next to
her.&nbsp; She also saw that her legs were wound up in the single sheet
they used for cover, hence the "tail" in her dream.
<p>Nina sighed and relaxed.&nbsp; She had her doubts before, but now she
knew she wasn't going to do it.&nbsp; She would turn down the offer from
Mermaid Seas.&nbsp; But she was awake now, and the way she felt she didn't
think she could go back to sleep.&nbsp; What she really wanted to do was
to go for a swim.&nbsp; But while her new home with Jim included a tennis
court and a large outdoor whirlpool tub, it didn't have a swimming pool,
even though Jim had promised her often that he would make good on that
mistake.
<p>That didn't help Nina now though, and as she lay there under Jim's arm
her need for a swim kept growing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina was a water sprite in
some ways, she was only ever really at peace in the water, and that dream
had shaken her up.
<p>Unable to stay still any longer, she began the delicate task of climbing
out of bed.&nbsp; Moving Jim's arm was the easy part, her husband slept
through earthquakes.&nbsp; Untangling her legs was a little trickier but
soon her long, muscular legs were free and she was able to slip out of
bed.
<p>Standing up, she knew where she could go for a relaxing swim, but hesitated.&nbsp;
What she had said earlier about Jim locking her clothes away was true,
he did just that.&nbsp; Looking around the bedroom Nina could see the built
in, yet unaccessable closets that contained all their clothes.
<p>At times it was exciting to be rendered helpless in this way, and at
other times embarrassing.&nbsp; But there were also times, like now, when
it was a little annoying.&nbsp; Jim's control of her clothing almost made
her feel like a prisoner at times, unable to go places on the spur of the
moment without his permission or at least knowledge.&nbsp; But she had
to admit that he had never refused her need for something to wear once
she told him why she needed it.&nbsp; At least...not when the need was
important.&nbsp; Jim liked to embarrass her with his naked games, but he
wasn't out to humiliate her.&nbsp; It was this difference that allowed
her to continue with this lifestyle, knowing that Jim would never abuse
his power over her.
<p>Still, at this moment it left her with few options.&nbsp; She was naked,
and had nothing she could put on.&nbsp; But...
<p>A wicked thought crept into her head, one the OLD Nina would never have
had.&nbsp; She just had to go four blocks...
<p>She grinned in the darkness and looked at her sleeping husband.&nbsp;
He would be out for hours yet, she had plenty of time.&nbsp; Nina decided
to go for it.
<p>With her heart beginning to thump hard, Nina headed downstairs and out
of the house.&nbsp; She didn't need to take a key with her, all the locks
were electronic with a keypad for entry, just so that Nina wouldn't need
pockets.&nbsp; So she let the front door close and lock behind her while
she crept toward the gate.
<p>She was used to being nude in her front yard, Lord knows she spent enough
time there working on the garden.&nbsp; Doing yard work wearing nothing
but heavy gloves had been hard at first, but she had soon gotten used to
it.&nbsp; But the yard looked different in the moonlight, so she crept.
<p>Six numbers, and the gate swung open.&nbsp; It was three o`clock in
the morning yet Nina still looked carefully around before venturing out
onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; A part of her couldn't believe she was voluntarily
leaving the house completely naked, just to go for a swim.
<br>Leaving the property nude was almost normal for Nina, she did it every
work day.&nbsp; She hardly ever got to wear clothes at work and since she
was nude at home all the time it seemed silly to Jim for her to dress for
the trips to and from work.&nbsp; So when she drove, it was nude.&nbsp;
But stepping out into the neighborhood was different.
<p>She thought briefly about going back for Jim's car, her own in the shop
at the moment, but she didn't know where Jim had dumped his keys.&nbsp;
So it was walk four blocks naked or give up on her urge to swim.
<p>She decided to go for it.
<p>She stepped out onto the sidewalk and let the gate close behind her.
<p>She walked quickly, a route she knew well, her arms wrapped about her
body, her senses keen for any activity beyond her own.&nbsp; She was acutely
aware of the feel of the concrete under her bare feet, now cool from the
night air.&nbsp; She could feel the wind about her naked body, tickling
her in places breezes normally didn't reach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina couldn't
begin to count the number of hours she had spent nude outdoors since coming
to live out here in this coastal town, yet at this moment in time it was
like it was all new again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina smiled.&nbsp; She wondered
what her friend, Tami, would have thought of Nina doing this.&nbsp; But
then, unsurprisingly, Tami hadn't seemed that impressed by some of the
things Nina had done while nude.&nbsp; It had been a while since the two
had spoken, a friendship lapsed.
<p>A car suddenly started nearby and Nina ducked, crouching on the sidewalk.&nbsp;
From a driveway just a few houses down, Nina could see moving lights.&nbsp;
She looked about for a place to hide and moved behind a short bush.&nbsp;
It wasn't the greatest hiding place, but it was all that was offered.
<p>She didn't need it.&nbsp; The car backed out of the driveway and headed
in the other direction.&nbsp; Nina sighed with relief and waited a few
minutes before moving on.
<p>She watched the house the car had come from carefully for more activity,
but didn't see any.&nbsp; She crept past on tip toe.
<p>Only one other incident marred her trip, and that was a car coming up
the street behind her.&nbsp; She was only aware of it when she saw the
street in front of her suddenly light up. Turning, she saw the car only
a block away and she made a mad dash for the house she was passing at that
moment.
<p>With her heart about to explode she watched from behind a wall as the
car went by.&nbsp; It seemed to slow a moment as it drew near, and Nina
feared she had been spotted, but it kept on going, finally vanishing around
a corner.
<p>'Getting caught like this isn't going to help my career much either,'
she thought.&nbsp; She waited as long as she dared, and moved out.
<p>Once she reached her former residence, the home of Brian Cook, she used
another code to get though the gate and gratefully made her way around
his impressive home to the pool on the other side.&nbsp; The pool was lit
up with underwater lights, but Nina didn't mind.&nbsp; She slipped gracefully
into the water and began a series of what she called "relaxing laps".
<p>It was just what she needed, and tensions built up during the day...well
during the past week really, melted away with each stroke.&nbsp; Water
was her element, and anyone watching the nude nymph would not have been
surprised at her being the Mermaid Seas mermaid.&nbsp; If ever a girl fit
the part it was Nina.
<p>"I thought that was you!" said an elderly male voice a short while later.
<p>Nina was floating on her back, her breasts and face the only parts of
her above the water, and with her eyes closed she hadn't seen anyone approach.&nbsp;
Startled, she almost went under before realizing that it was only Brian
Cook, standing in a bathrobe by the side of the pool.
<p>Nina felt a flush of humiliation as she realized her naked body was
well lit up by the pool lights, but it passed almost immediately.&nbsp;
She had lived, nude, with Brian for many months, and next to her husband
he was probably the only other male she felt completely at ease with in
that state.&nbsp; It was only his sudden appearance that surprised her.
<p>She smiled and paddled over to the side of the pool.&nbsp; "Hi, Brian,"
she said, "I hope I didn't wake you."
<p>Brian smiled softly and shook his head, "At my age sleep is hard to
come by some nights.&nbsp; I was awake anyway.&nbsp; I heard splashing
and looked out to see a beautiful water sprite using my pool.&nbsp; I had
to come down to introduce myself."
<p>Nina chuckled, "You sweet talker, you."
<p>Brian smiled softly at the young woman, "I should have you pose for
me like that one night, 'Water sprite reclining'."
<p>Both of them laughed, although Nina's was a little strained.&nbsp; Brian,
who was the sculptor of&nbsp; the statue of her in her own front yard,
plus five other nude works of her currently on display in other private
homes, might be half serious in his comment that she pose in his pool.&nbsp;
Nina knew she would do it if he asked, it was just that she had never gotten
used to being his model.&nbsp; But then it was her embarrassment that made
her valuable to him.&nbsp; Not content with normal nudes, Brian strove
to capture that essence of innocence and vulnerability that was common
to most women unclothed in unfamiliar surroundings.
<p>He watched as Nina held onto the side of the pool and looked up at him.
<p>"So what brings you here at this time of the morning?" he asked.
<p>"I...felt like a swim.&nbsp; I knew you wouldn't mind," Nina said after
a little hesitation.
<p>"Oh, I don't mind.&nbsp; It's just that three in the morning is a rather
unusual time to go swimming.&nbsp; Is something wrong?"
<p>"Why should there be anything wrong?"
<p>Brian just looked at her for a moment, before turning to go to a nearby
patio table.&nbsp; "Let's talk," he said.
<p>Nina paused before pulling herself out of the water.&nbsp; She padded
across the patio and wrung the water out of her long hair before sitting
down across from him.
<p>Even though Brian was old enough to be Nina's grandfather, the two had
become friends in the time Nina had lived there.&nbsp; In fact, Brian had
become the grandfather that Nina had lost when her real grandfather passed
on.&nbsp; He had become someone she could confide in when needed.
<p>"It's nothing...really," she finally said as she air-dried in the warm
night air.
<p>Brian merely waited her out, knowing she would talk when ready.
<p>She began to tell him about Arthur Dino's visit and her dream, and how
sometimes she felt a little frustrated at the demands being placed on her
personal exposure.&nbsp; "I mean," she said, "this guy wanted to pay me
to go topless on TV again, and seemed to take it for granted that I would!&nbsp;
It's just that it seems lately that all everyone wants is for me to never
wear clothes again!&nbsp; I feel like Tami Smithers!"
<p>"Tami's situation is different than yours.&nbsp; But I can see why you
are frustrated.&nbsp; I admit to some guilt myself," Brian replied to a
smile.
<p>Nina raised an eyebrow, "I should expect you would.&nbsp; You started
all this!"
<p>"True, but I had the good of art in mind when I set up your...rent."
<p>"Everyone has an excuse," Nina replied sullenly.&nbsp; Then she sighed
and looked over at him.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry.&nbsp; I guess I'm just
tired.&nbsp; I know you mean well, and so does Jim.&nbsp; Even Sara hasn't
been too much trouble.&nbsp; It's just that sometimes, I'd like to be normal,
you know?"
<p>"Normal around here, as you well know, is a matter of opinion," Brian
said with a grin.
<p>Nina chuckled, "Oh I know.&nbsp; But...there are times...when I wonder
just what my future will be like if I continue on this way.&nbsp; Do you
know that between home and work I spend almost all my waking hours with
nothing on?&nbsp; When I do dress it is rarely in regular clothes.&nbsp;
If I'm with Jim someplace it has to be in something so revealing that anyone
with eyes can tell I'm practically naked anyway.&nbsp; Can I really have
a career in Law with a lifestyle such as mine?"
<p>Brian wasn't sure he knew how to answer that.&nbsp; Instead he kept
his opinion to himself and looked at the pool.
<p>Nina sighed, "I guess I should head home before Jim wakes up."
<p>"How did you get here, did you drive?" Brian asked, noting that she
hadn't left a wrap anyplace he could see.
<p>"No, I...er...walked."
<p>Brian chuckled, "And you're worrying about being nude too much?"
<p>Nina grinned, "Yeah...well...I didn't say I didn't like it, just that
a break now and then would be nice!&nbsp; But at times it can be kinda...well,
thrilling!"
<p>Brian nodded slowly and smiled, "It can at that.&nbsp; Nina, if you
like, I could have a word with that young man of yours.&nbsp; Perhaps I
could mention your frustrations to him?"
<p>"No...please.&nbsp; There's no need, really.&nbsp; We're fine," Nina
replied softly.&nbsp; "I guess that all this mermaid talk and my mermaid
dream has shaken me up a bit.&nbsp; My head is filled with mermaid thoughts
of endlessly swimming through life in my natural state.&nbsp; It'll pass."
<p>Brian stood up, "In that case, I'll drive you home. A naked girl shouldn't
have to walk four blocks...often."
<p>Nina looked up and smiled.&nbsp; "This naked girl thanks you."
<p>Brian grinned.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Katie's Request,&nbsp; by BlueWords </p>
<p>Nina wondered how she kept getting into these kinds of situations. She 
hoped that eventually, she could put these type of things behind her. She 
still had over a year to go, living at Brian Cook's house under his rules, 
and working for Sarah Wickland under her similar rules. And her boyfriend, 
now fianc&eacute; Jim liked to have her under the same rules. </p>
<p>Those rules meant that she was naked almost all of the time. As part of
her agreement to stay at Brian Cook's house, she remained nude all the time
while she was there, so that Brian could study and sculpt her. Her boss Sarah
was often a sadistic bitch, but although she could no longer abuse Nina or
her friend and co-worker Helen, they both still had to work in the nude while
in the offices. And Jim just liked seeing Nina nude all the time. Jim was
always coming up with ways to keep Nina without clothes, and oddly enough,
had never seen her with anything on. </p>
<p>Actually, Nina currently had some clothes on, if you could call them that.
She had a short black top and short black skirt on. There were Velcro attachments
on the sides and arms so that the 'uniform' could easily be removed in parts.
Not that it hid much in any case, and Nina had not been given the back part
of her skirt. This left her backside completely exposed, which was in fact
part of the plan. </p>
<p>Nina was serving drinks at a party, where mostly very rich people mingled 
about. There were other women dressed similarly to Nina, serving drinks and
snack foods. Nina knew Ashley, Katie's "friend", but didn't know any of the
other servers. However, the other servers currently had all of their uniforms
on. </p>
<p>Nina wasn't there just to be a server. She had a special job that night, 
a special 'service' she was going to perform for one of the people at the 
party. She was not looking forward to it; in fact, she was dreading it. But
she had promised to help, and now there was no turning back. </p>
<p>Nina thought back to the phone call she'd received just four days before. 
'My life is nothing if not interesting,' she thought. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>"Nina, it's Katie," the voice on the phone said. Nina immediately sat up.
She'd not heard from the other woman in some time, and liked it that way.
Katie had helped Nina and her friend Helen out, but it had not been without
its price. Nina wondered what Katie wanted this time. </p>
<p>"Katie, how nice. I haven't heard from you in a while," Nina said, trying 
to keep her voice even. </p>
<p>"Cut the crap, Nina. We both know that I'm not your favorite person in
the world. But I do have something I need to ask you. I would like you to
drop by the club after work. It's important." </p>
<p>"I don't know if I can. Helen and I were..." </p>
<p>"It won't take long. Just come, all right?" </p>
<p>"I - okay, I'll be there," Nina said. She heard a click on the phone. Just
like Katie to say 'frog' and expect people to jump. Only in this case, Nina
felt somewhat obligated to go. Also, she was a little curious as well. What
could Katie want? </p>
<p>Just then the intercom crackled. "Nina, bring me those files on the Brown
case," her boss told her. </p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, right away." Nina jumped up and got to work. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Helen was driving a naked Nina to Katie's club. Helen was also naked from
the waist down. She and Nina had to work without clothes, and Nina never
even got dressed in the morning. Helen picked her up nude in front of Brian
Cook's house, and drove her back there on her way home. Helen usually pulled
her clothes off in the car before going inside the building in the morning,
and put them back on in the car before leaving the parking lot. Today, she'd
been in a hurry and only pulled her shirt on before driving off. </p>
<p>"So tell me again why we're going to see this witch?" Helen asked her friend. 
</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. She has something to ask me and said it was important." 
</p>
<p>"She didn't try and blackmail you again, did she?" </p>
<p>"No, although I guess the threat is always implied. For some reason, I
don't think that was what she had in mind." </p>
<p>They arrived at the club and Helen pulled on her shorts before getting 
out of the car. Since she had to work in the nude all the time, she usually 
dressed fairly casually. </p>
<p>"You don't have to come in, Helen. She only wanted to talk to me." </p>
<p>"You don't expect me to let you go in there alone, do you?" </p>
<p>Helen had parked as close to the front door as she could get, because Nina
had no clothes to wear and would be exposed from the car to the club door.
Luckily, traffic was light in the area, and the club was not yet open for
business. They made their way into the club, eyes having to adjust to the
darkness. Even though it was brighter inside than it would have been at night,
a full party going, it was still dark compared to the sunny day outside.
The two women looked around. Neither of them was happy about coming back
to this place; it held reminded them of things they would rather forget. </p>
<p>There was a man behind the bar cleaning up, and Ashley approached them 
as soon as they came in. Otherwise the place was deserted. </p>
<p>"Nina, I'm glad you came. Katie's waiting in her office." Ashley was wearing
almost normal clothing, it seemed. A tight T-shirt and tight jeans made it
obvious she had nothing on underneath. The leather cuffs around her wrists
and the collar she wore around her neck seemed out of place with her otherwise
casual attire. "She wants to see just you, Nina. Helen will have to wait
out here." </p>
<p>Helen wasn't happy about that, but Nina assured her it was okay, and followed
Ashley into the back. Ashley let Nina go through the door to the office but
didn't follow her in. Katie was sitting behind her desk. Nina felt self-conscious
being naked in front of Katie once again, but oddly enough, Katie didn't
seem to pay much attention to that. Katie looked troubled. </p>
<p>"Nina, thank you for coming. Please sit down," Katie told her. With Katie,
it sounded more like an order, but Nina noticed her usual crocodile smile
was gone. Nina took a seat. </p>
<p>"I'll get right to the point, Nina. I need a favor from you. A big favor. 
I need to ask you to do something for me, and to be blunt, it's not going 
to be easy." </p>
<p>"Why would I want to do anything for you?" Nina asked her. </p>
<p>"Ah, well, yes, direct as always. I like that in you, you know. In fact, 
there is probably very little reason you'd have to want to help me out. I
could probably blackmail you into it, I still have the video tape." Katie 
had gotten hold of a tape of her running around her old offices in the nude,
and hiding under the desk of Donald Bell, a lawyer now working with Sarah.
Nothing at all had happened, Donald had only been trying to hide Nina from
a searching security guard, but the tape and the guard's written statement
were very incriminating. Nina thought that if the tape got out, both her
and Donald's careers would be over, not to mention their lives being thrown
in upheaval. </p>
<p>"However, I'm not going to hold anything over your head. I'm going to ask
nicely, because I really need your help, and in this case, I need it voluntarily." 
</p>
<p>Nina had never seen Katie this way. The woman seemed almost scared of something.
It was kind of neat seeing Katie frightened, but at the same time, Nina wondered
what could frighten her like that. </p>
<p>"I'm listening," Nina told her. </p>
<p>"I am giving a party this Saturday. I'd like you to come and be one of
the servers, much like last time. Only this time, you'll have a special duty
to perform." </p>
<p>Nina already didn't like it. Servers wore only the uniforms and nothing 
underneath. The uniforms they had to wear stayed on with Velcro, and could 
easily be pulled off. Often, servers tended to end up naked by the end of
the evening at Katie's parties. She also didn't like the sound of the special
duty. </p>
<p>"What is this special duty I'd have to do? I'm not going to have sex with
anyone, if that's what you're asking." </p>
<p>Katie laughed. "No, no. If only it were that simple. I'll confess something 
to you, Nina." Katie paused. "You reap what you sew. I was taught by someone 
a long time ago how to keep tabs on people, to try and get any information 
you could to use on them, friends or foes alike. This person taught me well.
Only, he practiced what he preached, and he got something on me. Never mind
what it was, suffice it to say that when he asks me to do something, I generally
oblige. Most of the time, even happily." </p>
<p>So even Katie had someone she was afraid of, someone that could hold something
over her. She knew Katie wouldn't tell her what the man had on her, but she
couldn't help but be curious. </p>
<p>"In any case, this man has some peculiar tastes, and sometimes he asks 
me to fill them. This time, I'd like you to be the one the does it." </p>
<p>"Well, if it's not sex, what is it? Another performance?" Nina asked sarcastically. 
</p>
<p>Katie smiled her normal, just ate the canary smile. "No my dear, although 
if you wanted to, I wouldn't mind one." Katie then dropped her smile. She 
remembered that she was trying to be nice to Nina. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. I really am trying to reach out here, 
Nina." Katie paused, watching Nina closely. The other woman was guarded but
curious. "I'm not sure how exactly to put this. This man likes to, well,
he likes to spank women. He claims to have spanked literally thousands of
women." </p>
<p>Nina showed her surprise. Thousands? "Why should I want to be one of those
thousands?" she asked Katie. </p>
<p>"Normally, I suppose you wouldn't. I had hoped if I asked nicely you might
consent." </p>
<p>"I don't understand why it has to be me? Why not Ashley, or yourself, if
he's so important?" </p>
<p>"Nina, it's like this. He has in fact already spanked both Ashley and myself.
He doesn't like to spank the same woman more than once. He uses his hands
only, but it's a blistering, let me tell you. I still remember mine, and
it was years and years ago." Katie actually smiled. Nina thought it odd that
she would remember a 'blistering' fondly. </p>
<p>"I still don't get why you want me to be the one," Nina said. </p>
<p>"You weren't my first choice, girl! Whenever he comes into town, which 
isn't that often, he expects me to have at least one new server at my parties 
that he can talk into going into a back room with him and laying across his
lap. He's amazingly slick and charismatic, and usually doesn't have much
trouble with most women. In fact, he kind of likes a challenge. When he told
me he was coming, I started to ask around. But I found that most of the women
I knew would either outright refuse, wouldn't be in town, or had in fact
already been spanked by him." </p>
<p>Nina found this all too weird. </p>
<p>"I started to run out of prospects. There isn't anyone that I have - information
on that I can ask. Finally, it came down to you or Helen. I figured Helen
would probably refuse outright as I have no leverage over her, but I thought
that maybe I could talk you into it." </p>
<p>Nina shook her head in disbelief. "But, what happens when you can't find
someone for him?" </p>
<p>"Maybe nothing. Maybe he'd just be disappointed and leave. Or maybe he'd
be very upset. I don't want to take a chance, and I don't want to make him
upset. So I try and keep him happy." </p>
<p>"I don't really want to do this," Nina told her, then added, "What would 
be in it for me if I did?" </p>
<p>Katie smiled slightly. "Yes, that's the Nina I know and love. I don't know,
what would you like from me?" </p>
<p>Nina thought a while. "How about the tape? The one of Donald and me?" Nina
asked. </p>
<p>Katie smiled again. "I thought you might ask for that. I don't think I
can just hand it over, but I can do something else for you. In fact, let
me tell you a little story." Katie stood up and walked around the front of
her desk. It seemed like she was trying to get friendly with Nina, but the
real reason is that she just wanted a better look at the naked beauty before
her. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>---------------------- <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>----------------------- </p>
<p>"After the last party you attended at my house, I watched the tape of you
and Mr. Bell. I realized that there was probably another copy or two, and
that the security guards probably had them. I had someone on my 'special squad'
go to each guard's home and look through all their tapes. Not only did they
find the original of that tape, they found a few others that I can make use
of, although that's neither here nor there. The upshot is I now am pretty
sure I have all the copies of that particular tape. I know that there's not
a copy in the office building's archives. It's unlikely that Sarah made a
copy and hid it somewhere else. So, I have them all." </p>
<p>"How does that help me?" Nina asked. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm willing to destroy all the copies except one. That one will 
be edited some more. What I'll do is have Donald Bell taken out completely. 
It will still have your little jaunt around the building but there will be
nothing identifying whose office you were in. I'll shred the statement Mel
made at the time. With no tape, Mel's word won't mean much. Donald should
no longer have anything to fear." </p>
<p>Nina thought for a few moments. The tape could conceivably still be used
to hurt her career, but at least Donald was no longer in any danger. It might
be a fair trade. </p>
<p>"So, let me get this straight. All the tapes gone except for the bit about
me, in exchange for my letting this man spank me?" </p>
<p>"That is about the size of it," Katie said. </p>
<p>"How do I know I can trust you to get rid of the other tapes?" Nina asked. 
</p>
<p>"Well, technically you don't. If you want, after Saturday, I'll let you
watch me edit Donald out of the tape." </p>
<p>Nina did not want to let some stranger spank her, and she didn't want to
help Katie out. But maybe she could help Donald. She thought of Donald's wife
and children and how they might be hurt if the tape ever got out. </p>
<p>"I'll have to talk this over with Jim," Nina told the other woman. </p>
<p>"You can't tell anyone. Jim or Sarah, or especially Donald," Katie told 
her. </p>
<p>"No way. I have to tell Jim. He's my fiance for goodness sake, I don't 
keep secrets from him anymore. Especially about you, Katie." </p>
<p>Katie sat there for a few moments. "All right, but just Jim. No one else.
If they ask about your red butt, you'll have to have some other story made
up. I don't think it would be a good thing to upset the balance that you
have at your office, anyway." </p>
<p>Nina thought about Jim, and how he occasionally spanked her. Another story
wouldn't be hard. But it occurred to her that she wasn't gaining very much
in the transaction. Even though Donald would be protected against an accidental
exposure of the tape, he'd still be afraid of it. The dynamics of the situation
were just too much. And Donald did seem to enjoy himself at times.&nbsp;
Perhaps leaving a little fear in him was a good thing. Nina wondered what
would happen if Donald learn the evidence against him was no more. He seemed
a little afraid of Sarah in any case, even after witnessing her spanking.
Sarah had that kind of effect. </p>
<p>So Nina would be doing this for Donald's wife and children. But she needed
something more. </p>
<p>"All right. But I want something else as well," Nina said. </p>
<p>Katie frowned. "And what would that be?" </p>
<p>"You need to leave Helen alone, from now on. You don't ever ask her to
do anything like this, or come back to your club, or anything else, ever.
I know you don't really have anything on her, and I expect you to not ever
even try to get anything. She's off limits to you from now on." </p>
<p>Katie got up from her desk and walked back around to sit in her chair. 
"You are really no fun at all, do you know that Nina? Okay. I'll leave Helen
alone from now on, assuming you do this." </p>
<p>"If Jim says it's okay, then I'll do it. And I'll expect to watch you edit
that video the next day." </p>
<p>"It's a deal. Now go, ask Jim quickly. If you don't do this, I don't know
what I'll do. Maybe I'll ask Helen after all..." </p>
<p>Nina stood. "Don't you dare! I'll call you tonight." </p>
<p>Nina left without saying goodbye. I hope Jim agrees, Katie thought. I
need this. </p>
<p>Nina walked by Ashley and grabbed Helen's arm. "Time to go, Helen," she
told her friend. Helen had been drinking a soda at the bar and talking with
Ashley, waiting for Nina to come out. Nina didn't wait for her to finish
her drink. </p>
<p>"Bye, Ashley," Helen called as Nina practically dragged her out of the 
nightclub. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Nina was in her room and Brian Cook's house, naked as usual. She sat on
her bed, holding the phone. </p>
<p>"Hi, it's me," she said. The person on the other end of the line recognized 
her immediately. </p>
<p>"Hi, Nina, I wasn't expecting you to call tonight. Nice to hear your voice,"
Jim told her. </p>
<p>"Well, I need some advice, and I needed to ask you. I talked with Katie 
today." </p>
<p>Jim paused. Nina had wished there were time for them to meet face-to-face, 
but he lived too far away for her to make the trip to his house and back that
evening. </p>
<p>"What did she want?" he asked cautiously. </p>
<p>"She needs a favor. If I do this - thing - for her, she'll help me out. 
Well, she'll help Donald Bell out, sort of." </p>
<p>"Maybe you should start from the beginning," Jim told her. </p>
<p>Nina told him the whole story, just as Katie had told her. Jim listened, 
saying little as Nina explained about the party and the strange man that wanted
to spank her, and about how Katie promised to destroy the tapes, and alter
what was left. </p>
<p>"Well, that's interesting. You say she seemed scared?" </p>
<p>"At first, yeah. She's afraid of this guy, whoever he is. I got her to
promise to leave Helen alone from now on, as well, but otherwise that's it.
She didn't want me to tell anyone else, but I said I had to tell you." </p>
<p>Jim was silent for a while. "Do you want to do this?" </p>
<p>"Not really! I mean, you've spanked me, but I love you, and it sounds like
this guy was serious. But Katie sounded desperate, and if it's not me, she
might find some way to get Helen to agree." </p>
<p>"Well, as odd as it sounds, if you're willing to do it, I guess I'd agree
as well." Nina was surprised. She'd expected Jim to talk her out of it. "Only
one more condition." </p>
<p>"What?" Nina asked him. </p>
<p>"She has to invite me to the party as well." </p>
<p>"What? Jim, no! It's going to be bad enough I have to be there, I'd feel
funny if you were there too." </p>
<p>"That's the condition. You need someone there to look after you, and I'm
the guy. I don't think that Katie will have a problem with it. Trust me." 
</p>
<p>Nina shook her head. "If you think so. All right. I'll call her and tell
her." </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Katie had accepted Jim's condition. Nina would work there at the party 
as a server and let the man, whoever he was, spank her. There were a few other
wrinkles that Nina wasn't aware of that almost made her back out. The first
was the costumes. It wasn't that she objected to wearing one, because it
was more than she usually got to wear. </p>
<p>At this party, each server was numbered, and each piece of the outfit they
had on was numbered as well. At various times throughout the party, Katie
would use a spinner that would pick out a number. The server with that number
would then have to spin again, and remove whatever piece of the uniform that
the number indicated. This would go on during the party, randomly leaving
the servers with less and less on. </p>
<p>Jim was going to drive Nina to the party, which meant she would be naked 
going there. Jim had something he needed to do, but would show up later, and
after it was over, give her a ride home. At least when she started out, she'd
have the uniform on, but there was no telling how much she'd be left with
by the end. </p>
<p>On the way there, she had talked to Jim about getting spanked. She hadn't 
thought it was a big deal, since Jim spanked her on occasion and she usually 
even liked it. Jim warned her that, although he didn't know who the man was,
he might spank her a bit harder and longer than he usually did. It might
hurt. </p>
<p>"Remember when Sarah's dad spanked her? That was no walk in the park for
her, let me tell you." </p>
<p>Nina was starting to regret agreeing to help Katie, but she kind of felt
trapped. Even though she'd tried the rest of the week (or said she had),
Katie had not managed to find anyone else that could come to the party that
would either agree or hadn't already met the man. If Nina backed out now,
Katie would be mad, and although she promised not to release the tape, there
was no telling how she might try to get back at her. Helen had already fallen
under Katie's spell once, and Nina was worried that it might happen again.
It was why she had made the condition for Katie to leave Helen alone. </p>
<p>So Nina got up her nerve and decided to go through with it. Jim dropped 
her off and wished her luck. Katie met her at the door. </p>
<p>"Nina, lovely as usual," Katie told her. Nina was naked as usual. "Come 
in, your uniform is waiting for you in the back room. You're a bit early, 
so I can show you around and let you know what to expect." </p>
<p>Katie showed her to a bedroom. There was a rack of uniforms hanging there,
and Ashley was just starting to put hers on. </p>
<p>"Hi, Nina," she said. Ashley was smiling, happy that someone else she knew
was going to be there, and that they would be taking some of the heat off
of her. </p>
<p>"Hi, Ashley." Katie walked to the rack and pulled out a hanger with her
uniform on it. I've added stockings and garters this time. Your shoes are
down here. Come find me when you're dressed." </p>
<p>Nina frowned. She seldom got to wear clothes anymore, but when she did, 
it was something revealing like this anyway. Nina began to put the thing on. 
</p>
<p>"I'm glad you're here, Nina," Ashley told her. </p>
<p>Nina looked curiously at the other woman. "Why's that?" </p>
<p>"Well, frankly, most of the attention is going to be on you tonight. Katie
has been so busy trying to please Mr. Dover that she's been leaving me alone,
for the most part. It's been a nice respite." </p>
<p>"Mr. Dover? That's his name?" </p>
<p>Ashley laughed about that. "No! I don't really know his name, he never 
said, and Katie never told me. I call him Benjamin Dover." She laughed some
more. Nina looked puzzled for a few moments, then got the joke. 'Ben Dover.' 
</p>
<p>"So you don't even know who he is?" </p>
<p>"No. I just know that he really knows how to spank. Don't plan on sitting 
down anytime in the next few days. But, it's not without its pleasures, as
well." Nina wondered how getting a hard spanking could be pleasurable. </p>
<p>Ashley had finished putting her outfit on. She actually looked kind of
good in it, Nina thought, even with the addition of the collar that was around
her neck. I hope I can wear it as well as she does. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
"I need to go to help out with the food, and Katie will probably want to...
well, I need to go. See you later." </p>
<p>Nina watched her go. She wondered what Katie had over her, and if Ashley 
would ever get out from under it. Nina finished getting dressed, but was in
for a shock. Her uniform did not have the back part of the skirt. It left
her butt uncovered. Nina sighed, wondering if it was a mistake or done on
purpose. She found her shoes and put them on. They were very high-heels, and
she had to practice walking in them for a few minutes before she was sure
she wouldn't trip and fall. She went out of the room and back to the front.
Katie noticed Nina coming. </p>
<p>"Nina, you look great. Be a dear and help Ashley in the kitchen, would 
you?" </p>
<p>"Katie, there's no back to this thing!" Nina told her. </p>
<p>"That's the idea, dear. I want my friend to be drawn to you right off." 
</p>
<p>Figures, Nina thought, frowning. She went off to find the kitchen and help
out. </p>
<p>After a half hour or so, Katie found Nina and pulled her aside. "I need 
to tell you what to expect and how to act, Nina. The special guest will be
here in an hour or so. He'll talk with others, but you should be the only
one here he approaches and asks, since he's already done everyone else. He
already knows that my help is 'willing'. I'd like you to play hard to get
for just a bit, but not too hard." </p>
<p>Nina had been listening when something occurred to her. "Oh my gosh! He's
not going to do it in front of everyone, is he?" </p>
<p>Katie smiled. "No! As much fun as that might be, he'll take you to an empty
back bedroom. You won't have an audience." For some reason, that made Nina
feel a little bit better about the whole thing. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>-------------------- <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>-------------------- </p>
<p>"How will I recognize him?" she asked. </p>
<p>"He's hard to miss. He is very handsome, about six-foot tall, and very 
muscular. And he should be the only one here asking you if you want to go
in the back so he can spank you." Katie grinned. "After he does it, he'll
leave you alone. He might come back out and try to pick someone else up,
for, um, other things. You can rest a while, but I must ask that you come
back out and help with the serving again." </p>
<p>Nina wanted to protest, but decided against it. Hopefully, the party wouldn't
go on too late. By going back out afterwards, she was risking other pieces
of her uniform being taken from her </p>
<p>"I just thought, what if he doesn't like me for some reason? Or chooses 
someone else?" </p>
<p>"I don't think you'll have to worry about that. I suppose you're asking 
about our agreement. Well, of course, it would be off." </p>
<p>"That's not fair. I've come here willing tonight, to help you out. I want
more than that or I'll leave now." </p>
<p>Katie blanched. "All right, all right! Tell you what. I'll hang on to the
tapes, but I will give you Helen, just for your cooperation tonight. How's
that sound?" </p>
<p>Nina considered the offer. At least she'd get something out of it. "Okay, 
deal." </p>
<p>Guests started arriving, and Nina became anxious each time the doorbell 
rang. She recognized some of the guest from the other party she'd been to
at Katie's house, although this time there seemed to be fewer politicians. 
</p>
<p>Ashley was the first one to loose a piece of her outfit, and it was the
front part of the top, leaving her breasts exposed. Nina was amazed to see
that Ashley had both nipples pierced. There were gold rings through them,
and a short gold chain hung down between them. She seemed embarrassed about
having to show them off. </p>
<p>Besides serving drinks to the guests, Nina seemed to often get asked to
do clean up duty. She was asked to go around and pick up empty glasses, a
task that had her bending over a lot. </p>
<p>Nina had missed his entrance, but she was pretty sure that the man she 
saw near the punch bowl talking with Katie was her mystery man. He looked 
the part, and she'd been right, he was handsome. The suit he had on was impeccable,
and he had an air around him that exuded charm. If Nina hadn't been engaged
to Jim, she might have thought about flirting with the man for real. </p>
<p>Katie was nodding and laughing, and seemed to be pointing out the servers 
to the man. Nina turned and started walking slowly in the opposite direction, 
giving the man a good view of her butt. She wondered when he might make his
move. </p>
<p>Throughout the evening, Nina watched the man mingle, and even served him
a drink at once point. He didn't seem to be paying much attention to her. 
</p>
<p>Almost another hour passed before he came up to her. Nina was worried that
he might not choose her, but then she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned
and he was there. His gaze on her was intense, and Nina felt her heart skip
a beat. The man seemed to have an aura around him. I love Jim, I love Jim,
Nina repeated to herself. </p>
<p>"Excuse me, but I couldn't help but notice you, young lady," he told her. 
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir?" Nina replied. "Can I get you something?" </p>
<p>"Perhaps later. I'd like to ask you something, if I may." </p>
<p>"All right," Nina said. "What can I do for you?" </p>
<p>"There is nothing more I like than a beautiful backside. And while the 
rest of you is gorgeous, your buttocks are magnificent." </p>
<p>Nina blushed. She was supposed to flirt with the man and play hard to get.
Flirting was going to be easy, but playing hard to get, not so easy. </p>
<p>"Thank you, sir." </p>
<p>"I like to - sample beauty, and would be happy if you would allow me to
examine yours more closely." </p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, sir," Nina said, smiling. "I have work to do, and 
my employer might not take kindly to my taking a break." </p>
<p>"I'm sure Katie won't mind at all. In fact, I imagine she'd insist. Trust
me, you'll enjoy it, too." </p>
<p>Nina tried to look concerned, but the truth was that the man had almost 
hypnotized her. Under normal circumstances, she would have gotten up the strength
to refuse his advances. But she was supposed to give in, and even Jim knew
what was going to happen. She was very conflicted, because she was suppose
to go with him, but also because she wanted to. </p>
<p>"Okay," she answered in a small voice. The man guided her through the party
and out of the room. Nina managed to give her tray to one of the other servers
before she left. She had hoped to catch a glimpse of Jim before heading off,
but he apparently hadn't shown up yet. The man led her down the hall to the
end, to one of the back rooms in the house. </p>
<p>The room was sparsely furnished. There was a rather plain bed in one corner,
a bedside table with a lamp on it, a mirror on one wall with a narrow table
below it, but otherwise the room was empty. The curtains had been closed,
and the lamp was on low, making the room dark, although it was still fairly
easy to see inside. There was a door to one side, apparently to a bathroom. 
</p>
<p>In the middle of the floor was a lone chair. It had a padded seat and a
straight back. Nina supposed it was put there purposely to allow someone to
sit with someone else draped over their lap. </p>
<p>"Come," the man said, leading her inside. Nina followed him in, and he
shut the door. He went to the chair and sat down, and motioned Nina to come
and stand in front of him. "I find it best if you aren't encumbered by that
uniform. So before we start, perhaps you could indulge me. Remove it." </p>
<p>Nina gulped. This was it. She began to take off the skirt. "Wait. Put some
movement into it. Dance a bit." Nina felt odd, because she didn't feel like
she could dance all that well, and there was no music playing. She tried
to think of a song and move to it. If it was awkward, the man in front of
her didn't seem to mind. </p>
<p>She slowly removed the front half of the skirt and tossed aside, turning 
her back to the man. "What should I call you?" she asked him. </p>
<p>"You may call me Tony," he answered her. Nina tugged at the back of the
top, pulling it off and tossing it onto the skirt. As she danced, she wished
that Jim were there. She would have felt better about her performance if
it were also for him. </p>
<p>She didn't know that Jim was about to see it anyway. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Jim arrived shortly after Nina and Tony headed for the back room. He found
Katie and asked what was going on. </p>
<p>"They've just gone back," she replied. </p>
<p>"Damn. I was hoping to get her before that happened. I don't suppose there's
anyway I can see what's going on?" </p>
<p>Katie smiled. "Well, there's no cameras set up like last time, if that's 
what you mean. However... Follow me." </p>
<p>Katie led Jim down the hall and into a bedroom. She opened the closet and
motioned him to step inside. It was a walk-in closet, but had nothing in
it. She closed the door and it was dark inside. Then she headed to the back
wall and pulled up a window shade. The window looked in on the next room,
where Nina was dancing in front of Tony. It was obvious that the window was
a one-way mirror; the couple in the room could not see them. Nina had just
finished taking the last piece of her uniform off and was dancing in garters,
stockings and heels. </p>
<p>"Why is she dancing?" Jim asked. </p>
<p>Katie kept her voice low, explaining things to Jim. "He probably asked 
her to. He can be very persuasive. By the way, this is soundproof, but don't
yell or anything, they still might be able to hear it. I never tape him,
we have an ... agreement. But I don't think he'd mind us looking on." </p>
<p>Jim wondered what this man had on Katie that would kowtow her like that. 
He'd never seen her that way before. So he asked her. </p>
<p>"It's complicated. I owe him a lot, and just for insurance, he has a few
things on me. He's never really threatened to use them, too much the gentleman.
But I'm afraid of some of the things coming out, so I try to please him." 
</p>
<p>"Would he really have been upset if there wasn't a new butt to spank at
the party?" </p>
<p>"I've never found out. He's made it clear what he wants, and so I always 
oblige. I had two other candidates this time, you know. Both of them are out
of town. And his visit was a surprise. I knew that you spanked Nina on occasion-" 
</p>
<p>"How, how did you know that?" Jim asked. He'd told no one, and didn't think
Nina would have told. </p>
<p>"She goes to work nude, Jim! It's not like she can hide something like 
that. I keep my eyes and ears open. Anyway, I don't ever want to find out 
if he'd get mad or not. He probably knows that. It doesn't matter, though. 
I keep him happy, he does an occasional favor for me. It's mutually beneficial." 
</p>
<p>"He won't hurt her, will he?" Nina was down to rolling the last stocking 
off her leg. </p>
<p>"Well, Jim, it's not like that. Does Nina like it when you spank her?" 
</p>
<p>Jim nodded. "I think so. It's not that I do it very hard most of the time." 
</p>
<p>"It will hurt, like a bad spanking. But it will also be - it's hard to
describe. After he's done, he'll let her rest in there. Go to her. You won't
regret it." Jim wondered what Katie could mean. He watched the man intently.
Maybe he could get some pointers. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Nina was now completely naked, having removed her garters, stockings and
shoes. Tony motioned with his hand, and Nina came up and lay across his lap.
Tony adjusted her until he was comfortable. He ran his hand over her buttocks.
"Try not to kick," he told her. Nina hope she could keep her feet still. </p>
<p>Up until that point, only Jim had ever spanked her. She had found it strangely
exhilarating. But it was because she loved Jim, and he loved her. And they
usually ended up making love afterwards. There was no love between her and
this man, and there would be no sex afterwards. She was only doing it to
please him, to help Katie. She hoped it wouldn't hurt too much. </p>
<p>Nina was unprepared for the first blow, and let out a yelp. "Shhh," Tony
told her. "There will be time for that later." He began the spanking in earnest.
The room echoed with the slapping sound of his hand hitting her buttocks.
Nina could feel the stinging heat grow over her buttocks. </p>
<p>Nina wasn't counting, but she figured probably fifty swats went by before 
Tony changed what he was doing slightly. The blows seemed directed somehow, 
and they sent shock waves through her flesh. She was starting to get turned 
on! She definitely felt vibrations in her pussy. She tried to think of Jim,
and naturally thought of the last time he'd spanked her. That made her even
more horny, because they'd made love right after that. Nina was fast approaching
an orgasm. She began to whimper, from the pain and from the pleasure Tony
was causing. </p>
<p>"That's okay, little one. Try thinking of your boyfriend or ... it is a
boyfriend, isn't it?" Nina nodded, afraid to speak. "Think of him, if he
were here, watching you." At that point, Tony, while still spanking Nina,
looked up and diredtly at the mirror. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>"Can he see us?" Jim asked Katie. </p>
<p>"No, but he probably knows we're here. Me at least. Not sure how he guessed
about you. He's damn smart." </p>
<p>"Who is he?" </p>
<p>"Call him Tony. That's all I can really tell you, Jim." </p>
<p>Jim didn't understand. He turned back to watch his fiancee as she began 
to writhe on Tony's lap. </p>
<p>"Don't be too jealous, Jim. He's an expert at this, he's done it thousands 
of times, on thousands of women. I know of some women who've begged him for
a second time. As far as I know, he's never spanked the same woman twice.
And Nina wouldn't be there if I hadn't asked her." </p>
<p>Jim wasn't actually jealous. He was wondering if he could learn how to
spank like that. </p>
<p>Katie and Jim couldn't clearly hear what was going on in the next room, 
but it was obvious that Nina was having an orgasm. It looked to Jim like she
was crying out "No, no, no", and maybe even saying his name a few times. He
felt a bit better then. </p>
<p>--- <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>------------------------ </p>
<p>"Oh, god, no, no, no, ahh, Jim, Jim, JIM! Ahhh!" </p>
<p>Tony finally stopped his spanking. It had been most satisfying for him. 
This one had a beautiful butt, nice and firm and tan, and it looked even better
the shade of red he had made it. He inspected her butt closely, admiring
his handiwork, feeling the heat rising from it. It was a point of pride for
him that he seldom caused bruises, and it seemed that there were none this
time either. Her butt was a wonderful shade of red. Nina winced slightly
from his touch, and seemed worn out from the ordeal. </p>
<p>Tony easily lifted her up and carried her to the bed. He placed her on
her stomach. "Stay here a while. I'll be right back. Tony went to the bathroom
and used one of the towels there to wipe his pants off. Nina had left a wet
spot on them. There was a blow dryer as well, and he used it to dry the spot
so that it soon was gone. Then he soaked a towel in cold water and took it
out to Nina. He laid it across her buttocks. </p>
<p>Nina flinched when the towel was put on her, but then felt better under 
its coolness. "Stay here for a while before going back out, all right?" </p>
<p>Nina turned and looked up at Tony and nodded. "Thank you, Nina. You were
most enjoyable." He turned and left the room. </p>
<p>Before leaving, and unseen by Nina, Tony gathered the top and front half
of her skirt from the floor, taking it with him. Out in the hall, Katie and
Jim stood outside another bedroom door. Tony handed the outfit to Katie. </p>
<p>"She won't be needing this the rest of the night. Very nice, Katie, you've
done exceptionally well this time." </p>
<p>Katie smiled the biggest, happiest smile Jim had seen on her in some time.
"Thank you, Tony. It's getting harder and harder as time goes by." </p>
<p>Tony smiled thinly. "I'm sure you'll come through, as always." Tony nodded,
and Katie left him alone with Jim. </p>
<p>After she was gone, Tony laughed. "I always like to keep her on her toes,"
he told Jim. </p>
<p>"Well, I've never seen her like this before. You certainly have a way with
women." </p>
<p>"You must be Jim, whose name I've heard so much recently," Tony said, continuing
to smile. </p>
<p>"That'd be me. Speaking of women, I don't suppose you could teach me some
of those moves you had in there. I'd like to get that kind of reaction sometime." 
</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll learn, especially with her. From what I can tell, she 
loves you very much. I can't imagine what Katie had to do to talk her into 
consenting to my request." </p>
<p>"Yeah, that Katie. Always an angle on everyone. Says she learned from a
pro." </p>
<p>"I'll take that as a compliment," Tony replied. "You should probably get
in there. I think your Nina will be very happy to see you." </p>
<p>"I'll do that. You do realize that this was a one time deal, don't you? 
I won't allow you to do this again, regardless of what Katie does." </p>
<p>Tony put his large hand on Jim's shoulder. "Son, they are all one-time 
deals. I wouldn't have it any other way." He turned and walked back to the
party. </p>
<p>Jim went into the room and found Nina on the bed, softly muttering, "Ow,
ow, ow" over and over. </p>
<p>"Are you okay, wench?" he asked her. </p>
<p>"Jim, oh my god, I'm sorry, but the way he spanked me, I, I just couldn't 
-" </p>
<p>"Nina, Nina, it's okay. You did what we both thought you had to." </p>
<p>Nina looked up at him. "James Barb, I love you. Make love to me." Jim raised
his eyebrows, then began to remove his tuxedo. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>A while later, laying in each other's arms, Jim broke the silence. Not 
that their lovemaking had been silent; it was anything but. Jim had grabbed 
her butt as he thrusted into her, and the sensations he caused had sent her
off on several more orgasms. He had needed to kiss her to muffle her cries,
less the whole party come and see what was going on. </p>
<p>"I hate to say this, but they are expecting you to go back out and help 
again. Katie has been short a server for over an hour now." </p>
<p>"Can't she make due without me?" Nina asked. </p>
<p>"You should get back to work. I'll make it worth your while after the party's
over." Nina sat up, flinching from putting weight on her butt. </p>
<p>"I'll hold you to that, Mister," she told him. She got out of bed and went
to the bathroom to clean up. When she came out, Jim was starting to pull
his clothes on. Nina found her garter belt and stockings and pulled them
on. </p>
<p>"Have you seen my uniform?" she asked him, slipping her shoes on. </p>
<p>"Tony took it. Thought you didn't need it the rest of the night." </p>
<p>Nina grimaced. "I have to go out there naked?" </p>
<p>"Look at it this way. You might have lost most of your uniform to the spinner,
anyway." </p>
<p>Nina shook her head. She guessed that it kept up her streak of never wearing
clothes around Jim, but she just wished it weren't in such a public place. 
</p>
<p>"You know I like you better like that anyway," he added. </p>
<p>Reluctantly, she accompanied him back to the party. </p>
<p>Several of the other servers had lost portions of their outfits, but none
was completely naked yet. Ashley still had the back of her top and the front
of her skirt on. Nina made her way to the kitchen to get a tray of food,
knowing that people were staring at her red butt. She wondered if they could
tell she'd just made love to her boyfriend as well. Probably, considering
her luck. </p>
<p>At least I can't loose any more of my outfit, she thought. </p>
<p>It turned out she was wrong. When it came her turn at the spinner, since 
she had already lost all of her uniform, they had her remove her stockings. 
Now she served people in only high-heels. </p>
<p>At one point, she noticed Tony talking to Ashley, and the two of them heading
to the back rooms. Ashley was smiling and had even caught Nina's eyes and
waved before heading back. Nina made a point to remember to ask her how he
was. But with Ashley gone, Nina had to help pick up the slack. She kept busy
the rest of the night. </p>
<p>By the end of the night, most of the servers were naked or practically 
naked. Luckily, the other party-goers knew that Katie had a "look-don't-touch" 
policy at this party, so Nina didn't have to fend off any groping hands, other
than from Jim. Ashley actually ended up wearing the most; she had a collar
around her neck in addition to still having her shoes, garters and stockings
on. Nina had lost even her shoes. There were various jokes going around as
to what would happen if her turn came up again, but luckily she wasn't picked
another time. </p>
<p>After the guests had gone, a tired looking Katie told her she could leave.
"I'll get Ashley to clean up," she told Nina. "If you want to come by tomorrow,
we can take care of the tapes." </p>
<p>"I'll be here," Nina said. She and Jim went out front, and Nina stood by
the door, waiting for him to pull the car around. The headed off for the
long trip home. </p>
<p>On the way, Nina scooted over in the seat and sat as close to Jim as her
seatbelt would let her. She was turned sideways so that she could reduce the
pressure on her butt. It still hurt from her spanking. </p>
<p>"Hey," Jim said. "It's kind of late, and it's a long trip back to Brian's 
or my folks house. What would you say if we stopped off at, say, this motel 
here and spent the rest of the night? Then we could just head back up to see
Katie about the tapes in the morning." </p>
<p>Nina grinned. "I don't suppose there would be much sleeping going on," 
she said. </p>
<p>"Probably not," he replied. </p>
<p>"Sounds great!" Jim turned the car into the motel parking lot. Nina tried
to scrunch down in the seat to avoid being seen by the motel clerk. Jim came
back with a key and they drove down a ways to find their room. Jim got out
and opened the door, and Nina jumped out of the car and ran into the room. 
</p>
<p>"Great! Two beds. I guess that one's mine," she said. </p>
<p>"Not so fast, wench. I get the one next to the window." Jim grabbed Nina
and tossed her down on the bed. Despite the pain in her rear, she could feel
herself getting turned on again. Jim quickly joined her in nudity. </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>The next morning, after a fast food breakfast in the car, Jim drove Nina
back to Katie's. Ashley answered the door. She was in cuffs and chains that
hobbled her and reduced her reach, but she smiled when she saw them. </p>
<p>"We didn't expect you back so early, but it's good you came. Katie is in
a good mood. She's in the breakfast nook. Follow me." Nina and Jim followed 
the shuffling naked woman through the house to where Katie sat in a robe. 
</p>
<p>"Nina, Jim! I didn't think you'd be coming so soon. You must have gotten 
up early." </p>
<p>"Well, actually, we didn't make it very far. It was late last night, so
we stopped off at a motel," Jim told her. Nina playfully poked him in the
ribs for revealing more details than she thought Katie should know. </p>
<p>Katie smiled, a warm, friendly smile. "Can we get you anything, coffee 
perhaps? Ashley knows how to brew a great cup of coffee." </p>
<p>"No, no, that's fine. We've had breakfast already," Nina offered. </p>
<p>"Well, let's get to business, shall we? Come." Katie stood and led them 
through the house. She opened a door and inside was a variety of computer 
and video equipment. Katie had quite a collection of high-tech devices. She
sat down in a chair and opened a drawer. She pulled out three video cassettes,
each of which were labeled "Nina West/Donald Bell". </p>
<p>"This is the original, a copy and a slightly edited copy." She put one 
in a VCR and pressed play. The video showed Nina running around naked, finally
entering Donald Bell's office. Katie rewound the tape, then pressed a button
on the player. The word "ERASE" came on the screen and a whining noise could
be heard from the machine. Katie rewound it again and pressed play; only
snow showed on the screen. She ejected the tape and dropped it in a wastebasket.
She did the same to the first copy. </p>
<p>Katie then showed them the edited tape. When it came to the part where 
Nina entered Donald's office, Katie bookmarked the spot. She did the same 
when the tape showed Nina leaving the office. She used her machines to copy
the tape to a blank cassette, without the part including Donald's office.
The result was that Nina was shown running around the office floor, then
leaving. The skip was obvious, but there was no indication of what happened.
Since the office floors were pretty generic looking, it was hard to tell
even what floor she was on. </p>
<p>Katie erased the original tape. She pulled out the document Mel had signed
and put it through a shredder. </p>
<p>"Well, that's that. I don't have any other copies anywhere, and I think 
I've found all the other ones that were made," Katie told them. </p>
<p>"By the way, I talked to Tony last night. He told me, and I quote: 'Katie, 
you obviously saved the best for last. I know that you've felt obligated in
finding me someone new every time I come into town. But last night you outdid
yourself.'" </p>
<p>Nina stood shocked. She wasn't sure how to react to having a connoisseur 
of spanking pay her the highest compliment. </p>
<p>"Well, thanks, Katie. Except for my having trouble sitting down today, 
I guess everything worked out all right." </p>
<p>"Yes, thank you, Katie," Jim said. "I guess Nina and I will be going now." 
</p>
<p>Katie got up and showed them to the front door. "You know," she said along
the way, "It helped that he choose Ashley afterwards as well. They seemed
to enjoy themselves quite a bit, from what I've heard." Katie lowered her
voice conspiratorially. "Don't let her know, but I'm going to take it easy
on her for a few days." </p>
<p>Nina shook her head in wonder. Such odd happenings, and yet everyone seemed
happy, for once. She and Jim said goodbye and left Katie's house behind. </p>
<p>After Nina and Jim left, Katie went back to her high-tech room. 'Do I
really need this?' she thought, referring to the tape of Nina. 'It's not
like it's that big a deal any more. Nina goes to work naked because she likes
it now, not because of this tape.' </p>
<p>She put the tape back in the editing machine. She pressed the ERASE button,
wiping the tape clean. 'What she doesn't know won't hurt her,' Katie thought.
'I didn't mention what else Tony told me.' </p>
<p>"Katie," he had said, "I've never dissuaded you from the notion that you
needed to provide me with someone at your parties when I showed up. Tonight
was a treat indeed, so I'm letting you know that I don't expect you to top
this one. I'll release you from having to scrounge someone up next time.
I'll just find my own companion when I get to town after this." </p>
<p>Katie hummed to herself, putting the now blank tape back in her safe. 'Not
a big gesture, I suppose. Maybe I'll tell her someday. Now, I wonder what
Ashley would like to do today? I know what I'd like. Maybe she'd like it
as well.' Katie smiled, happy. </p>
<p>Nina was also thinking about the tape and what she thought was still on
it. </p>
<p>"Jim, I know I can't tell Donald or anyone about the tape being edited, 
but what's left on the tape, do you think it's really that bad?" </p>
<p>Jim thought a bit. "Actually, I suppose not. I mean, so you ran around 
the office naked? You do that now. Some of the other lawyers might not like
it, but since you're working for Sarah, I don't think they'd complain too
much. Hell, you could probably come up with a good excuse for it anyway. You
spilled something on your clothes, needed something to wear in the meantime,
thought you saw a sweater at someone's desk." </p>
<p>"So, the only reason I need to continue not wearing clothes at work is
so that it doesn't upset the 'balance' too much. Right now, no one has the
upper hand. We're all more or less equal, or at least, back to square one." 
</p>
<p>"Well, there's that, and the fact that I think you should continue to do
it as well." </p>
<p>"You do?" </p>
<p>"I've yet to see you wearing much of anything, other than that mermaid's 
tail." They both laughed about that. "Besides, I think you don't mind it that
much in any case." </p>
<p>"You're right," Nina murmured. </p>
<p>"What?" Jim asked, missing her comment. </p>
<p>"I said, okay. I'll keep doing it, for you, if nothing else." </p>
<p>"Say! You don't have to be back at Brian's at any particular time, do you?"
Jim asked. </p>
<p>"No, why?" </p>
<p>He pointed to a motel coming up. Nina nodded her head vigorously, so he
turned into the motel parking lot. It was some time before a very happy Nina
finally made it back to her room at Brian Cook's house. <br>
