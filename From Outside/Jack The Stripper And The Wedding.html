 Stacey woke up that morning with a hangover and some burning in her pubic area, lifted the sheets that covered her body and remembered what happened the night before and felt even more naked in the absence of her pubic hair. She got out of bed to stretch her muscles a little, tripping over Lucy who was on the floor, and emitted a subtle groan when she was awakened by Stacey who stepped on her hand, ignoring that she was there asleep barely covered by a sheet.<br>
<br>
Stacey looked around her room making sure she didn't bump into anyone again, she went to the room that looked like a student dormitory due to the apparent disorder, she saw Holly and Michelle sleeping naked on the couches and she was trying to remember everything that had happened the night before, without making any noise she thought she would go to the bathroom to take a hot shower and later put some cream on her pubes where she felt a little burning thanks to the improvised Brazilian waxing that was done hours ago.<br>
<br>
She approached the kitchen because of the aroma coming from there, when she entered she found her mother who woke up first that morning, fresh as a daisy, perfectly combed and made up, smelling Channel n°5 radiant with joy in her new high heels and nothing else on her body. Donna served breakfast to her husband Angus who was very pleased with the loving attention provided by his radiant and beautiful nude cook.<br>
<br>
They both said good morning to Stacey and offered her an aspirin in view of all her daughter drank the night before. She kissed Angus' cheek and immediately she took her place at the table and joined them for breakfast.<br>
<br>
Stacey wasn't yet sharp enough to process what was happening in the kitchen, beyond the gratitude she felt when she received that aspirin she took right away. Seconds later Emma and Lucy appeared in the kitchen and praised Donna for the delicious smell coming from the kitchen, as well as praising how radiant she looked that morning and wished their host a good morning and he kindly invited them to join them at the table.<br>
<br>
Rosa appeared in the kitchen attracted by the aroma of the bacon and the coffee that was freshly made, she said good morning while carving her eyes due to the daylight that filled that space through the wide windows and to which she was not fully accustomed, Since she barely had a minute to get out of bed without thinking about anything else but the aroma coming from the kitchen, she saw her father-in-law who said good morning to her and Rosa who since her arrival had only gone through unusual and painfully embarrassing situations, only able to cover herself with her hands before the burning in her pubis that reminded her how naked she was.<br>
<br>
Donna approached her to calm her down by extending a cup of coffee while she laughed at the reaction of poor Rosa who realized that the others had not been dressed since the night before. A car horn was blaring repeatedly outside the house.<br>
<br>
Angus - That must be Richard and Malcolm, I'm going to play squash with them - He got up from the table, kissed his wife and daughters, said goodbye to Rosa and Lucy while laughing a little like everyone else in the kitchen at Rosa's reaction.<br>
<br>
Rosa was intensely red because of how embarrassed she felt when her father-in-law saw her and this made it worse for her because of the mocking that everyone was doing to her ribs during the whole breakfast, Rosa was not very used to being seen naked and much less by her father-in-law, she calmed down a little bit her embarrassment when she saw her mother-in-law and all the others who had all night before to relax about it and acted in a very natural way.<br>
<br>
Michelle and Holly entered the kitchen also attracted by the smell of breakfast, they were a little sore and hung over. The breakfast did a lot of good for all the girls who took turns showering in the bathrooms of the house.<br>
<br>
Stacey was looking forward to her wedding trousseau which was already on her bed, she took a few minutes to try on the beautiful bridal lingerie for the occasion while the mirror gave her a rewarding image, she still felt some discomfort from the Brazilian waxing mainly because of the new panties which she removed immediately feeling a great relief on her skin.  Michelle and Holly went into the room with everything necessary to do Stacey's hair and makeup and she was ready for the photo session that would take place before the wedding.<br>
<br>
The house was a complete riot of women going up and down, a slight chaos reigned in the air for so many women getting ready for the big occasion. Holly, Samantha, Lucy, Michelle, Rosa and Emma would be the bride's bridesmaids. All of them would wear beautiful strapless dresses designed by Diana Gautier whose haute couture creations were the favorite of all of them. Diana achieved wonders by highlighting the beauty of any woman who put herself in her hands.<br>
<br>
The beautiful dresses were wine colored, adjusted precisely in the necessary places and endowed with a splash of elegance very close to perfection, it took several weeks for Diana and her team to achieve the desired results and it required many tests on the part of the bride and her bridesmaids, who were happy that morning when they were ready to go to the photo session that would take place in a section of the city's central park where there was a beautiful lake surrounded by trees.<br>
<br>
Stacey was ready to put on her beautiful wedding dress, filled with the idea that in just a few hours she would be the wife of Werner Von Humboldt with whom she was deeply and hopelessly in love.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
She spent several minutes looking at herself in the mirror in her wedding dress, the décolleté was deliciously sensual, highlighting her feminine forms with a touch of innocence, which sat wonderfully with the beautiful bride who imagined all the happiness she was waiting for for her as she walked out the front door into her new life as the wife of the man she loved so deeply.<br>
<br>
That morning the city was in a well deserved calm after the tumult of the previous night, Strip Boulevard was being cleaned up while many merchants opened the doors of their establishments as they did every morning and for many people, the memory of the previous night seemed like a horror movie presented on television by a sensually gothic woman known as; "The Mistress Of The Night" on Channel 8 every weekend night.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Shannon was a beautiful young art student who was heading to the park in a hurry that morning, wearing a comfortable short dress made of a light fabric that was very appropriate for the activity she was heading to.<br>
<br>
The entrance to the park was already in sight where her employer, the prestigious photographer Sabine McArthur, was waiting for her. She extended her hand to greet her as soon as she saw her approach and started to get out of the trunk of her car the equipment she would be using that morning.<br>
<br>
Without noticing it, agitated steps were approaching behind Shannon, who shot towards the Rrrriiiiip bushes. Sabine saw her assistant fall to the ground and the mysterious runner was going directly towards her, knocking her down to the ground without her being able to react while her comfortable pants and blouse were being torn off, resuming those agitated steps that went away gloating in their crapulence.<br>
<br>
Shannon stood up as best she could, she was a little dizzy from the attack and ran towards Sabine who was still lying face down on the ground with her bottom in the air and some pink panties tangled in her thighs, dazed by the blow she stood up with Shannon's help and accommodated the panties that her attacker was unable to tear off with the pants and blouse from which pieces of fabric were lying on the ground as a remnant of the recent attack.<br>
<br>
Sabine leaned back in her car trying to regain consciousness, her knees and arms hurt a little due to the fall and the quick struggle she had with "Jack the Stripper" she felt the sun caressing her naked legs and shoulders, Shannon brought her a bottle of water.<br>
<br>
Both were trying to process how this was possible and in a matter of seconds a single attacker ripped off the clothes of two women. Sabine was terrified when she saw her watch, because it was time to start the photo session, which she had scheduled for that morning in that place a month ago.<br>
<br>
Shannon was just as worried and invaded by the mortification of being in public, she thought that fortunately there would only be women who would possibly understand the situation in view of the wave of attacks and the growing fame of Jack "the Stripper".<br>
<br>
In the park Stacey with her mother and all her bridesmaids, arrived at the agreed upon place of the appointment, somewhat surprised not to see Sabine who was known for her punctuality and accuracy. Rosa offered to go and look for Sabine who was possibly very close by, Samantha wanted to accompany her and they both went to the south gate of the park located very close to that point where they thought they could find the photographer. Neither of them was aware of how all her movements were observed from a distance.<br>
<br>
Sabine and Shannon unloaded the necessary equipment for the photographic session and headed to the meeting point with the bride and her ladies. Rosa and Samantha saw them walking in the park and approached them imagining that they were delayed that morning, it was more and more normal to see a woman living the same situation, a year before they would have been scandalized by the woman who passed by in her panties jogging with her dog passing in front of them, or the 2 naked girls running around terrified looking to hide in the vegetation because of the recent stripping of their clothes.<br>
<br>
Sabine and Shannon were grateful that Jack could not manage to get them out of those clothes. And they walked with Rosa and Samantha to meet Stacey and her bridesmaids for the agreed upon photo session.<br>
<br>
In another part of town, preparations for the wedding feast continued. Elegant tents were being erected by a team with years of experience in the field. In the kitchen of the venue, another team worked tirelessly to prepare the banquet, under an atmosphere of threatening shouts that pressured all those working on the preparation of the reception, leading them to live in an unnecessarily tense atmosphere.<br>
<br>
The tent provider was arguing angrily with a woman who he demanded to be allowed to do his job. That woman was Evie Moriarty, a local socialite who had suddenly become a wedding planner, and she believed that attending so many luxurious receptions in her lifetime made her an expert on the subject, Her family readily conceded to any whim Evie might have, so her idea of becoming an entrepreneurial service provider for local jet-set events immediately gained the financial support needed to even out compete a couple of local companies that had to settle for working on events outside the city's aristocratic circle.<br>
<br>
Evie's whimsical refusal to take the competition out of the market was due to her relationships with the wealthiest families in the city who she convinced mainly by offering them in a very flattering way an ostentatious service at an extremely low price, was something that managed to get many contracts to Evie, who fed her vanity every week with the reviews of the social section in "The Sun" newspaper that thanks to a monetary impulse, was unleashed in praises to Evie as the maximum star in the organization of social events for the aristocracy.<br>
<br>
One of these companies affected by the situation was owned by the Toboni family whose youngest daughter, Aurelia, was more than unhappy with what they were going through. She was furious at the unfair way this had hit her family and caused them to contract many debts in order to continue working. Aurelia hated to see her parents, once happy and prosperous, passionate about their work, now dejected by losing their talented chef and many of their long time collaborators, who left them in the face of the tempting offers made by Evie Moriarty and to whom they agreed to leave the company that always treated them as family members.<br>
<br>
Aurelia spent months thinking about how to help her parents recover what they had lost and during all that time she worked secretly in the events organized by Evie to study in depth a way to achieve her goal. She went unnoticed by not using her last name and since Evie was such a snob, she never knew who that girl with black hair and big brown eyes was who waited tables under her dictatorial orders every weekend.<br>
<br>
In the park the photo session took place, Sabine managed to capture with her talent beautiful images of Stacey dressed up as a happy and excited bride, some with her proud mother, both looking especially radiant thanks to Sabine's skillful handling of natural light in that beautiful country setting provided by the park.<br>
<br>
 They began to take pictures of the bride surrounded by her ladies and you could still feel a little bit of Sabine and Shannon's mortification as they were working on their panties and bra despite their attempts to hide it. Lucy was located just behind Stacey for the next picture and wanting to break the tension and all that solemnity, She pulled Stacey's dress up to her waist just as Sabine was taking the picture, capturing a hilarious expression on Stacey's face the moment she was exposed and it became clear that the bride was not wearing underwear under her luxurious wedding dress.<br>
 <br>
Laughter was inevitable at Stacey's face as she tucked her dress back in, and the tension disappeared. After all, it was traditional for them to play pranks on the bride in her last hours of being single, and the night before was the best proof of that.<br>
<br>
They settled back down for another shot, Lucy was next to Stacey, Shannon moved the screen a little to cancel out some glitter in the shot, the camera was firing and Stacey's and Lucy's dresses were on the floor just as the flash was seen on Sabine's camera, they all had big smiles on their faces and were laughing at the 2 naked girls in the middle of the shoot.<br>
<br>
They both posed with laughter for a couple more pictures before putting their dresses back on and did so with funny and somewhat suggestive poses as part of a growing joke, the camera shutter not stopping and each posed next to the smiling bride who was looking more and more amused as the camera shot.<br>
<br>
"No, Lucy, stop! Please, no!" <br>
<br>
It was the screams of Rosa who was now chasing Lucy naked trying to recover her dress, she also couldn't stand the panties after the violent Brazilian waxing she had done the night before. The laughter did not cease as the camera captured every funny moment in that lonely part of the wooded park in front of the shining lake.<br>
<br>
Shannon helped Sabine by passing her a new roll of film for the camera, while Lucy, Rosa and Stacey caught the other ladies by surprise by unzipping their dresses, first it was Emma who helped with Holly, Michelle and Samantha's dresses. Donna as a mother was safe for the moment, while her daughters and daughter-in-law chased the others away from their panties, the camera again masterfully captured the fun scene.<br>
<br>
The group photos resumed, now with Donna and her midnight blue dress in the center with her daughters on either side, it didn't take long for Emma and Stacey to undress Donna during the next shot amidst a collective laugh, Donna posed in suggestive ways for Sabine thinking they would be a priceless gift for her husband Angus, While the others arranged their dresses in an orderly manner, they would pose for a few more shots as a group, and when they were finished, they would dress again, to head for the wedding in a carriage that would arrive in 20 minutes to pick them up at the entrance to the park.<br>
<br>
They all posed smiling for the photos that would be a fun wedding gift.<br>
<br>
Sabine was standing in front of them taking the last pictures with her camera when suddenly the fun atmosphere changed.<br>
<br>
-Rrrriiiipppp Come back here you miserable! Shannon was screaming as she ran after someone in a black outfit and a hoodie shaking a pair of pastel blue panties in her left hand, it was Jack The Stripper himself.<br>
<br>
Lucy came out of her heels and ran after Jack, she wanted to realize that macabre plan that she developed during months of reversing roles to turn the stripper into her victim.<br>
<br>
They all shouted "Lucy, stop, come back here!" as Emma and Michelle went out behind Lucy to stop her and keep things from getting worse, while the others watched Shannon calm down from the attack she suffered for the second time that day, making sure she wasn't hurt.<br>
<br>
Shannon soon calmed down, panting at first from the shock and running in a failed attempt to recover her panties.<br>
<br>
Emma and Michelle lost sight of Lucy in the vegetation and kept calling her, worried about what might happen to their friend.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later they saw Lucy coming out of some bushes a little exhausted from the race, but victoriously waving what seemed to be part of the famous stripper's pants, stunned they saw the perverse joy illuminating Lucy's face.<br>
<br>
Emma: Did you catch it? I hope you hit him in the face.<br>
<br>
Michelle: Lucy, we were so worried about you, that guy might have hurt you.<br>
<br>
Lucy: I knocked him down and tore his pants, he was very slippery and pushed me to the ground and ran away. When I got up, he was lost in the bushes, but I brought this trophy.<br>
<br>
Emma: Let's go back soon, remember the wedding and we still have to get dressed again.<br>
<br>
Lucy broke out laughing and nodded. The three of them went back to where the others were who might be worried about them.<br>
<br>
Once Shannon recovered, Samantha got up to look for the dresses because the time of the ceremony was very close, she was petrified to discover that all the dresses were gone.<br>
<br>
Holly: Michelle, can you pass me my dress, the one with the black lace panties on it?<br>
<br>
Samantha: Someone took them, they didn't leave anything behind!<br>
<br>
The others heard that, not being able to believe what was happening. Stacey went into shock, Rosa broke down in tears and fell on her knees in the meadow. Donna was frozen and wondered how it could have happened, she was looking at the dresses and in the blink of an eye they were gone, plus the carriage was already waiting for them.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Meanwhile, in the area where the wedding ceremony and the reception would take place, Evie's hysterical screams continued to harass all the staff, who turned down the volume a little as soon as Werner arrived at the site accompanied by his parents Wilhelm and Annelise Von Humboldt who had arrived from Germany two days before for the wedding of their only son, minutes later the guests arrived as well as the McClaclans; Angus who would give the bride as his father, his brother Richard who was accompanied by his beautiful wife Magda who looked like a movie star because of the fine black dress he chose for the occasion and also Malcolm, the bride's brother and Rosa's husband, all ignored how the photo session ended and were anxious for the bride and her bridesmaids accompanied by Donna to make their entrance into the venue.<br>
<br>
Soon they would be joined by Julia who was in the habit of making spectacular entries with her presence, she was wearing a beautiful long red dress with bare shoulders and an elegant opening in the front, delicately fitted in the right spots of her exuberant anatomy, the color highlighting her pale skin and long red hair.<br>
<br>
It was difficult for the male eyes present there to avoid noticing the arrival of the beautiful Julia, who radiant with her smile was received by the McClaclans and presented with the Von Humboldt by Werner himself.<br>
<br>
Aurelia quietly went about her business without losing focus on what she had been planning for months. In the center of the garden, an elegant Victorian-style structure was erected, covered by a tent in which the ceremony would take place.<br>
<br>
The wind at times came to blow with some force and calmed down, it was nothing out of the ordinary in that season of the year given the geography of the place.<br>
<br>
Evie received the guests and talked to many of them, being an active and well-known member of that aristocratic circle. She would not stop walking around the place, casting murderous glances at all her staff, who could no longer stand her.<br>
<br>
Aurelia waited patiently for everything to start, waiting for Evie to stand at the entrance of the temporary chapel, ready to receive the bishop who would officiate the ceremony. Aurelia approached Evie naturally to ask for some directions, while Evie pointed out where she should be located, Aurelia hooked a discreet device built by her right in the central seam of Evie's dress where the zipper was, and inside the tent one of the fastening points would be already loose so that the wind would contribute to the fun.<br>
<br>
Evie received the bishop ceremoniously and bowed in reverence to greet him, Aurelia's home device consisted of a modest hook attached to the seam of the dress on one side and a smaller hook attached to the seam of the zipper, When Evie bent down the seams tightened and discreetly began to open, so that this could happen, Aurelia had some time alone with that dress which she carefully and thoroughly sabotaged once Diana Gautier handed it to Evie through her employee Aurelia.<br>
<br>
The wind blew strongly making the tent expand outwards, as it was not perfectly attached to the stakes on that side, the loose tent pushed Evie when she leaned over and sent her to the ground making the seams of the dress burst, the bishop stepped aside to avoid being hit by the tent that was repeatedly shaking, the wind unexpectedly hitting more strongly, causing more stakes to come loose, this was not planned by Aurelia who was standing in the place indicated by Evie watching as things were getting out of control.<br>
<br>
Evie got up stunned by the continuous pounding of the tent, her dress was on the floor and instinctively sought to get away from there, the stake that was to hold the tent did not stop shaking, Evie ran without realizing what had happened to her dress which like almost all the designs of the house Gautier, was designed not to wear a bra, Diana applied some fillers at Evie's request with the specifications she used in all the bras she wore to hide a couple of extra cups over her extremely tiny breasts, which she could never correct with a surgeon, due to a strong religious belief of her family who opposed to change surgically anything in their bodies because of vanity, so things like tattoos, piercings and breast prosthesis were the only things that were denied to the capricious Evie, who lived more than complex with that part of her anatomy and whose secret was now in sight of the local aristocracy.<br>
<br>
Evie noticed the loss of her dress and covered her chest with her hands in shame, the tent was being put under control, she walked terrified among the guests, tripping over 2 members of the kitchen who were carrying an elegant and huge pot of soup that would be served at the banquet.<br>
<br>
Her heels previously sabotaged by Aurelia came off causing the trip with the people in charge of carrying the pot on which now Evie was inside splashing mushroom cream all around her. Among those affected was Annelise Von Humboldt whose dress was ruined thanks to Evie's fall, who stood up like a spring from the floor and furiously threw the big pot that completely tore the lace that shaped her panties.<br>
<br>
The photographer that she requested to "The Sun" newspaper to cover the event, did not miss the opportunity to capture graphically every moment since Evie lost her dress in front of the bishop and all the attendants to this lavish wedding.<br>
<br>
Shame and anger filled Evie who forgot for a moment her place in the event and immersed in a childish tantrum was shouting at her staff with curses and even violently attacking Annelise who Magda and Julia ran to assist her with the intention of taking her to the bathroom and trying to clean her dress.<br>
<br>
Julia who heard the racist insults that Evie was shouting to both staff members and Annelise, was soon putting the arrogant wedding planner in her place, who, overcome by her anger heightened by the sensation of the hot cream on her skin, was shouting insults left and right, forgetting her nakedness, and tried to beat Julia who nimbly avoided her, which made Evie fall back into the mushroom soup sprinkled on the floor.<br>
<br>
She was soon rebuked by the McClaclans and by Werner accompanied by his father, both of whom had their eyes lit up with fury due to the insults received by their sweet Annelise.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the park the photo session had an unexpected and distressing conclusion, the ultimate joke that could be made on the bride and her entourage went beyond what was expected. None of them had a dress for the wedding and time was pressing them to get there, it was impossible to solve this since the recently stolen dresses took months to make and no matter how much money Diana Gautier was paid, she could not put a remedy to the problem, added to the fact that the boutique was far away from there. Everyone thought that this time "Jack the Stripper" had gone too far.<br>
<br>
Lucy stopped waving the torn pants she ripped off Jack as Stacey came to after the shock of the print.<br>
<br>
Misfortune once again clouded the fate of these women for whom it was impossible to escape the circumstances. Fate showed its face and they would have to deal with that latent expression.  Rosa was the most affected by the shame that invaded her.<br>
<br>
Stacey remembered that the carriage was waiting for them and for no reason would she allow her wedding not to take place. Shannon approached Rosa to comfort her, took off her bra and used it to dry her tears as she did not have a handkerchief available and that was the only fabric available.<br>
<br>
Lucy and Samantha went to the carriage to ask the coachman to wait a little longer, they would tell her the truth, Stacey saw them leave and she remained pensive, never allowing frustration to invade her, she would hate to ruin her makeup on such an important day, she would not lose the radiance of her face, she would not do it at that moment!<br>
<br>
Sabine: This morning the parliament validated the public nudity, a few minutes ago you looked so happy posing without your dresses for the camera. That maybe.... Shannon and I can go with you, you know how I support, after all we are also victims of the serial stripper.<br>
<br>
Stacey saw Sabine putting away her lingerie with her photographic equipment, she helped Rosa up and realized that it was true, after all she still had the veil and her bouquet, the shoes and the garter, in a way she still looked like a bride.<br>
<br>
Stacey - I am getting married this day, I would like very much that my bridesmaids and my mother can share with me this great step in my life. Sabine and Shannon Would you like to join me? I would be honored if you would also agree to be my bridesmaids, after all you all have the same outfit.<br>
<br>
They all nodded and headed off to catch up with Lucy and Michelle in the carriage, Sabine and Shannon would follow in their car.<br>
<br>
At the entrance to the park was a luxurious antique white carriage and an elegant gold pinstripe on the sides, with 2 rows of fine red leather seats located behind the coachman's bench and this was pulled by 2 beautiful white steeds.<br>
<br>
A car stopped behind the carriage when a beautiful naked redhead approached it.<br>
<br>
"Lucy, where are the others?<br>
<br>
Lucy. - Hi Cynthia! -She ran to hug her followed by Michelle who came out of the bushes to greet her friend and tell her what happened.<br>
<br>
The carriage driver didn't believe his eyes and tried to keep a certain amount of concealment and seriousness.<br>
<br>
Cinthya had gotten out of her car driven by her husband William and they were on their way to the wedding, she was wearing a beautiful low-cut black dress whose straps surrounded her neck with a beautiful golden belt, made in the Art Deco style and her beautifully combed blonde hair, a classic worshiper would think of a glorious remastered return of Marlene Dietrich when he saw the beautiful Cinthya standing next to William's golden Rolls Royce Corniche.<br>
<br>
Cynthia: Girls, you never cease to amaze me, it's so nice to see you. Shall we go to the wedding?<br>
<br>
Cinthya was very perceptive and imagined what was happening with her young friends. She soon saw Stacey, Donna, Holly, Samantha, Rosa and Emma coming, whose nakedness confirmed her theory about what would happen. She turned to see William, who sighed and gave her a tender glance approving of whatever she wanted.<br>
<br>
William got out of the car to open the trunk where Cynthia carefully arranged all her clothes as she took them off. William knew himself to be a lucky man and loved his wife deeply and he indulged her even more when his wife was naked in public, the night before it was so pleasant for him to see her arrive home accompanied by Michelle and Holly. Now the excitement grew as she decided to put all her clothes in the trunk of the car with the disposition of arriving naked at a wedding with an almost revolutionary spirit, William thought that tomorrow he should visit the jewelry store in the center of town or maybe the Aston Martin dealer if things continue like this.<br>
<br>
Cynthia: Is there room for one more?<br>
<br>
They were all thrilled by the presence of Cinthya who warmly embraced each and every one of them, she glanced at Michelle and Holly who she praised for looking so beautiful that day and told them she would soon show them something when the reception started.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Back at the party Magda and Julia conducted Annelise to the bathroom where she removed her dress to try and clean it. Annelise was a beautiful 46 year old woman with green eyes and a generous, youthful anatomy, she had a sweet natural expression on her face. She married very young at 18 with Wilhelm with whom she fell in love almost immediately and 2 years later they had Werner who left Germany for graduate school and when he met Stacey he decided to settle down in this city and visited his parents once a month. She was very grateful to Magda and Julia for intervening in that distressing incident and she kept praising Julia for the elegant way she put that insolent and rude girl in her place.<br>
<br>
Outside, Angus, Richard, Werner and Wilhelm continued to rebuke the violent, naked Evie, the newspaper's social reporter, who already had about 5 rolls of Evie's images. He was eager to get to the newspaper's newsroom.<br>
<br>
Soon the bishop intervened in the discussion rebuking the capricious and angry socialite and was seconded by many people of the highest aristocracy present there who were highly indignant at the incessant litany of insults Evie uttered towards each of them.<br>
<br>
Evie drained mushroom cream from her hair to her feet, her tantrums were famous, which until that day were only a rumor that very few people in high society could testify in person.<br>
<br>
Angus: You are a terrible service provider, you are ruining my daughter's wedding and let me tell you, young lady, that this was your last event as an organizer, you have offended my daughter's mother-in-law and my family, you know perfectly well who I am in this city and that I am part of the parliament of which several members are present to witness your shameful behavior. Leave here immediately before I call the police.<br>
<br>
Evie had a psychosis of anger, she was about to pounce on Angus, when Aurelia took her from behind by twisting her arm up behind her.<br>
<br>
Aurelia: Mr. Mclaclan.  I'm very sorry about what happened, I'll take care of getting this annoying woman out of here.<br>
<br>
Angus: Thank you very much. What is your name?<br>
<br>
Aurelia: My name is Aurelia Toboni, sir.<br>
<br>
Angus: Are you the daughter of Francesco and Maria?<br>
<br>
Aurelia: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
Angus: I should have hired your parents for this event, but the flattery of this girl with my wife and daughters was more than enough. Can you make sure my daughter's wedding goes well?<br>
<br>
Aurelia: It will be a pleasure for Mr. McClaclan, and I appreciate his confidence.<br>
<br>
Aurelia kept applying force to Evie's arm as she carried her out into the street - you're ruined and socially wasted, how does it feel? Evie screamed in pain and kept cursing which caused Aurelia to increase the pressure on Evie's arm as she held the other one.  -By the way, you're naked. It's a shame I can't see you trying to get home like this, so be sure to read the socials section tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Aurelia threw Evie onto the street without much work, and she was left on the ground, her arm hurting so much from the blow, and her pride was violently destroyed that day. -By the way, Evie, now everyone in town knows that you don't have tits," said Aurelia with a laugh and before going back in she said, "You better go home, because I'll call the police before I take you out of here.<br>
<br>
Evie, terrified, covered her tits and started running, she was close to being run over by the steeds that were pulling the carriage, the coachman stopped shouting at her and preferred to calm down the horses that were frightened by that naked runner, she thought her day was getting stranger and stranger. The carriage entered the enclosure before the astonished and silent reaction of all those present.<br>
<br>
The beautiful bride and her retinue were getting out of the carriage, Werner immediately appeared to help the bride out of the chariot, told her in his ear how much he loved her and thanked her infinitely for her generous gesture, as if she knew the greatest fantasy of her future husband.<br>
<br>
Stacey hid her surprise - "I hope you can please mine" - she said - Werner kissed her lovingly and put on a necklace that has been in his family for generations and it is tradition for the bride to wear it on her wedding day. -Perhaps this will be the only thing you will wear in the next few weeks," Werner added. Stacey smiled delightedly and walked down the aisle.<br>
<br>
Annelise's dress required something stronger than a wet towel to get rid of all that mushroom cream. Through a window the three women saw the bride and groom come down naked from the carriage.<br>
<br>
Annelise smiled at what her eyes saw and immediately put all her lingerie over her dress. Magda and Julia exchanged glances knowing perfectly what was coming. The three women came out of the bathroom naked and asked someone from the service to put those dresses in storage, since it was getting late and they had to be present for the ceremony.<br>
<br>
The bride and her retinue of bridesmaids looked radiant at the altar, Angus proudly handed his daughter to Werner who exchanged his wedding vows with Stacey swearing to love each other forever.<br>
<br>
The wedding took place happily for everyone, the banquet and party was a delight where many women left their dresses to have as much fun as the bride, her entourage and the ladies who were naked from the ceremony.<br>
<br>
 The members of parliament invited by Angus were proud to approve the public nudity that morning and toast endlessly waiting for more weddings with a CMNF atmosphere.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Epilogue<br>
<br>
Werner and Stacey spent a fabulous wedding night and the next day left for an exclusive nudist resort located in the Riviera Maya in Mexico.<br>
<br>
Sabine printed the photos from the session that were treasured by her models as well as the brand new Von Humboldt -McClaclan couple.<br>
<br>
Shannon received proposals to model with the McClaclan firm and assist Sabine in the photographic production.<br>
<br>
During the banquet Cinthya fulfilled her promise to surprise Holly and Michelle when her nephew Danny appeared with his friend Albert, happy to see the girls with whom they danced all night and arranged to go out with them and take them to dinner. There was romance in the air that night.<br>
<br>
Lucy, Samantha, Emma, Stacey and Rosa reminded Michelle and Holly that they had a challenge to meet after that night. Which is another story.<br>
<br>
Angus thanked Aurelia very much for taking care of everything and offered his political support to her as well as to her parents Francesco and Maria who he would hire to host a banquet in her honor at City Hall next week. Aurelia immediately offered all the staff to continue working back with Toboni's where no one would ever mistreat them again, they all happily accepted and toasted to her later in gratitude for how she heroically got rid of Evie.<br>
<br>
Evie Moriarty walked home 2 hours after being thrown into the street by Aurelia, her parents were not home and aware of all that had happened, they left precise orders to the servants not to let their daughter into the house, as well as a fancy sealed envelope with a letter from her parents expressing to their daughter how embarrassed they were by her tantrums.<br>
<br>
 "Your credit cards have been cancelled, now you are on your own. We were wrong to give you everything and never put a limit on it, it is never too late to do so and now you are free to make your life as you please, you leave with what you have on and maybe when life shows you the value of humility and hard work, you can come back and we will receive you with some conditions.<br>
 <br>
Your parents love you."<br>
<br>
Evie was destroyed, in another attack of anger she demanded her butler to let her in, he saw with some contempt the girl who was starting to smell bad because of the mushroom cream that was decomposing on her, he closed the door in her face and threatened to call the police. Evie did not stop and made a big fuss, the neighbors called the police who in 5 minutes arrived at the place, submitted and put under arrest the scandalous girl who would go to jail on charges of damage to property and disturbance of public order. The next day she was the laughing stock of the entire aristocracy and society in general when a detailed article on her wedding scandal appeared on the front page of the social section, as well as some photos of her naked and covered with mushroom cream. It was a delicious gossip that lasted months to dissipate throughout the city.<br>
<br>
Several days later she was dressed in prison uniform to appear in court, where she was assigned a public defender and the trial was presided over by the honorable Judge Angus McClaclan who expedited the evidence presented by the prosecution and sentenced her to spend a year in a psychiatric institution where she would receive treatment for her mental disorder. After her sentence was completed, she would spend 3 years on probation under strict supervision of her family.<br>
<br>
Thanks to that hectic weekend and the photographs Angus received from his wife as a very special gift, with artistic nudes of his dazzling and beloved wife in the park.  Who looked more beautiful and spectacular than ever. Donna and Angus would intensely rejuvenate their marriage after the Moriarty trial.  It was a month-long vacation to the Riviera Maya, possibly to the same resort where Stacey and Werner spent their honeymoon.<br>
<br>
William visited the Aston Martin dealership where he purchased a beautiful silver Vantage coupe for Cinthya, which she received at her home the next morning during breakfast. William handed her the keys and gently whispered that friends would be coming over Friday to play cards. Cynthia looked at him sweetly, kissed him tenderly, put his robe in the trunk of the car and the two of them went for a ride around town.<br>
<br>
Rosa after that crazy weekend was finally able to free herself from some complexes and decided to follow the example of her mother-in-law. Malcolm enjoyed the most pleasant and sensual breakfasts from then on.<br>
<br>
Jack The Stripper was enjoying the headlines of the last few days and the pictures from last weekend's wedding, he would continue to make headlines in the city and planned to sophisticated his moves.</span>
