<br>
<br>Bailey and Jordan had a lot in common. Both were first-year engineering students, both liked computer role-playing games, and both were on the school's tennis team. There were even some similarities in their appearance - they were nearly the same height, had brown hair and dark eyes, and were pleasantly curved, particularly in the areas of their chests and hips.<br>
<br>
They were not, however, so similar that they could ever be mistaken for twins. Although neither girl was overweight, Jordan had a trimmer, more slender build and had a much lighter complexion. Jordan's facial features were more petite, and her eyes were dark green as opposed to Bailey's dark blue. Jordan's brown hair was very dark and was cut shorter than Bailey's medium length light brown hair.<br>
<br>
The two girls tended to have a competitive nature, particularly with each other. Most of the time they got along fairly well, even approaching friendship, although never to the point of being best buddies. Their rivalry sometimes caused disputes, which limited their closeness. If their academic and extracurricular activities weren't quite so closely aligned, things probably would have been less complicated, but being together so frequently added fuel to their competitive fires.<br>
<br>
Fortunately their disagreements never got too out of hand, one or the other of them applying the brakes before the situation could race out of control. At least that's how it had been through most of their first year at school.<br>
<br>
But today was different.<br>
<br>
There was nothing special about the day, nothing obvious at least. It was a bright spring morning, with a light breeze carrying the sounds of bird chirping merrily. The biting cold of winter had left, but there were still a few nibbles remaining before the warmer weather set in. Bailey and Jordan, wearing light jackets, had just finished tennis practice and were standing off-court talking.<br>
<br>
First, not surprisingly, they talked about tennis, but then their conversation drifted into other areas. There was some discussion about food, and french fries in particular. Jordan made a disparaging comment about them (which was odd, as it was a form of sustenance both girls liked a lot) which irritated Bailey. Wisely they changed topics, deciding to discuss the latest popular RPG game. This time Bailey said something which annoyed Jordan. Some more subject changes ensued until they alighted upon a topic which they both should have known to avoid: cards.<br>
<br>
Card playing was something both girls were good at. Not that they were experts, but they nevertheless took it seriously and had a lot of pride in their ability. Cards had been a flashpoint in the past, with both girls sharing the blame. When playing on opposite sides neither could resist the temptation to let an occasional snide comment slip. There was some body language that didn't help either - a quick smirk while melding, an amused snort when grabbing an opponent's card from the discard pile, going out with just a little too much gusto, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Their conversation heated up, but rather than changing the subject yet again, this time they both stuck to it. Even worse, for whatever reason, on that morning neither girl was willing to try to reign themselves in. Before long they were standing there red-faced and nearly shouting, their dark eyes peering into each other's with open hostility.<br>
<br>
They were making quite a scene, and some of their friends came over to find out what was going on.<br>
<br>
"SHE THINKS SHE'S BETTER AT CARDS THAN ME!!!" was Bailey's explanation for their disagreement, with Jordan offering up a similar account.<br>
<br>
As silly as the explanation for the argument was, their friends had plenty of first-hand experience with the two going at it over seemingly trivial things... although not to THIS level. It took some time to get both girls calmed down at least to the point where they could communicate at normal volume levels. It was obvious, however, that the two were more than ready to reengage, and would almost certainly do so if their friends left.<br>
<br>
"Why don't you have a tournament?" Vanessa, a friend to both, suggested. "Then you'll know who's better."<br>
<br>
Bailey blinked, then frowned.<br>
<br>
Jordan frowned, then blinked.<br>
<br>
Bailey and Jordan looked at each other, glanced over at Vanessa, then looked at each other again.<br>
<br>
"A FRIENDLY tournament!" Vanessa qualified, noticing some residual hostility in her friends' gazes.<br>
<br>
"That's a good idea," Jordan said a little while later.<br>
<br>
"Yes, I agree," said Bailey.<br>
<br>
The idea had been planted and was all set to grow... although not quite into what Vanessa had in mind.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Later that day, Bailey and Jordan sat down to discuss Vanessa's idea. They were both a little sheepish about the way they had lost control, yet there were still some bad feelings lingering just under the surface, for each girl felt the argument had been the other's fault.<br>
<br>
Their discussion went well, possibly because they were strongly motivated to succeed - Bailey was looking forward to the sweet taste of victory when she defeated Jordan, and vice versa. It didn't take them long to agree to a format for the tournament: they'd play nine different card games, with the winner being whoever won the most.<br>
<br>
But the discussion didn't end there.<br>
<br>
Simply winning the tournament didn't seem like enough; something was missing. There should be something to make the winner's victory more intense... and the loser's failure felt more keenly. Perhaps a reward for the winner? Or better yet, a penalty for the loser.<br>
<br>
Bailey came up with the idea that the loser would have to publicly acknowledge that the winner was a better card player. That would surely be a bitter pill to swallow.<br>
<br>
Yet that still didn't seem like enough.<br>
<br>
"How about if the loser has to do something really humiliating?" suggested Jordan.<br>
<br>
That led to a lengthy discussion, with ideas flying back and forth like a ping pong ball. Eventually they converged on a plan. It was a strange idea, yet seemed to fit the bill: the loser would have to negotiate the school's obstacle course... wearing an outfit designed and prepared by the winner!<br>
<br>
While they both liked the idea, and would have been perfectly satisfied to leave it at that if they were guaranteed of winning, neither girl was stupid. Despite their rivalry, they recognized that their opponent's skill level was nearly as good as their own, meaning losing was a distinct possibility. Without some additional restrictions they might well find themselves negotiating the obstacle course in nothing but socks and sneakers!<br>
<br>
Hence the discussion turned to the creation of a set of rules for the design of the loser's "uniform."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The first decision made was that there needed to be a minimum of one lower garment and one upper garment. There could be MORE than the stated minimum, should the winner so desire, but there had to be AT LEAST one garment above and below the waist. Without this basic requirement neither Bailey nor Jordan would even consider entering into the competition.<br>
<br>
An additional rule was immediately suggested by Bailey: "There can be no holes or slits in the material."<br>
<br>
The reason for that rule was pretty obvious, for without it the garments' material could be cut out at some rather unsuitable locations.<br>
<br>
"But there need to be SOME holes, like for the arms and legs," Jordan pointed out.<br>
<br>
This led to the rule being updated to "The material must form a continuous, solid surface without any holes or slits."<br>
<br>
Satisfied with rule 2, the girls moved on to another limitation: "The material must be completely opaque."<br>
<br>
Again, the reason for the rule was obvious. Bailey, however, asked for the clause 'at all times' to be added, for it wouldn't do to have the material become transparent if it was splashed with water or even just from sweat.<br>
<br>
On to rule 4. This rule was suggested by Jordan, and was indicative of the level of mistrust between the two girls:<br>
<br>
"Under normal use (including running an obstacle course), the garments must not open, tear, slide off, disintegrate or in any way reveal what's underneath."<br>
<br>
Bailey, not wanting any of these extremely awkward things to happen to her should she lose, agreed with no debate.<br>
<br>
Bailey thought these rules were sufficient, but Jordan thought more requirements were needed. She was picturing herself having to navigate the obstacle course in a bikini, or even worse, a thong!<br>
<br>
"Shouldn't we make a rule about the size of the garments?" she asked. "You know, like a minimum?"<br>
<br>
"Oh," Bailey replied, "I hadn't thought of that." She pondered a bit, then said, "Well, we could say the lower garment has to be at least as big as our gym shorts."<br>
<br>
The school's gym shorts weren't especially long, only extending about two inches below the butt.<br>
<br>
A moment later Bailey added, "Or we could go even smaller. You know, like booty shorts."<br>
<br>
"Uh, no!" Jordan replied. "Not THAT short!"<br>
<br>
This led to a discussion about various types of shorts - Jamaican, cut offs, Bermuda, boy shorts, and so on - along with the suitability of each. As the discussion continued, the girls started to argue about which types of shorts were the best to wear, and on what occasions, never seeming to agree about anything. This in turn led to a discussion about the various materials from which shorts were made.<br>
<br>
"Denim shorts are the best," Bailey proclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Denim is crap. Cotton's WAY better," Jordan argued.<br>
<br>
"You're wearing a pair of blue jeans," Bailey pointed out.<br>
<br>
"That's different! Denim's fine for long pants, but it sucks for shorts!"<br>
<br>
"That's ridiculous."<br>
<br>
They argued a while longer about materials, then moved on to colors and patterns. By this time both girls had gotten red in the face, but at least the volume of their speech had stayed at a reasonable level.<br>
<br>
It's likely their argument would have gone longer except for one thing: they had completely exhausted the subject of shorts. Neither girl could think of a single additional thing to say about them!<br>
<br>
Then Bailey said, "Uh... I think we may have gotten a little off topic."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean, off topic?" Jordan angrily snapped back. Then... "Oh. Uh, yeah."<br>
<br>
Calmer now, Jordan said, "Maybe we should just say the shorts have to be at least as long as our gym shorts."<br>
<br>
"Kind of what I said in the first place," Bailey couldn't resist pointing out.<br>
<br>
"BAILEY!"<br>
<br>
"OK, OK. Yeah, we'll go with that."<br>
<br>
Rule 5 had, with effort, been established.<br>
<br>
Bailey said, "Well that takes care of the shorts. What about the top?"<br>
<br>
This time an agreement was reached in less than a minute. With the minimum length for the top having been established, this gave them their set of rules:<br>
<br>
1) There must be at least one lower garment and one upper garment.<br>
<br>
2) The material must form a continuous, solid surface without any holes or slits.<br>
<br>
3) The material must at all times be completely opaque.<br>
<br>
4) Under normal use (including running an obstacle course), the garments must not open, tear, slide off, disintegrate or in any way reveal what's underneath.<br>
<br>
5) The lower garment must come down to at least the same point as a pair of size Medium school gym shorts.<br>
<br>
6) The upper garment must come down to at least a point two inches above the navel.<br>
<br>
There were still some other details to be worked out, but Bailey and Jordan sailed through these, agreeing on which nine card games to play as well as the time and place for their tournament.<br>
<br>
It seemed like they were all done, but then Jordan brought up a point that had been overlooked.<br>
<br>
"How can we be sure the loser will honor their debt?" She asked. "What's to prevent backing out?"<br>
<br>
It was a valid concern. A few ideas were proposed but none seemed adequate. It turned out to be somewhat of a tricky problem.<br>
<br>
Then Bailey came up with another suggestion. "Hey, remember those two sorority girls who had the big fight? Maybe that sorority could help."<br>
<br>
Jordan remembered clearly; the two girls had tried to tear each other's clothes off... right in the center of campus! Their actions had been a serious violation of the sorority's rules. To settle the dispute - and to make a point that such behavior was completely unacceptable - the sorority decided that the two girls would have a competition: they'd race each other for four laps in the swimming pool. Following the race, both girls would be punished, but the loser's punishment would be substantially worse.<br>
<br>
The two girls went through with their race, since the alternative was to be kicked out of the sorority. After the race was over, the winner received ten swats with the sorority's impressive wooden paddle. The loser, to her dismay, received twenty.<br>
<br>
Their penalty didn't end there, however. For the next week, whenever she was inside the sorority house (which was often), the winner was only allowed to wear a bra and panties. The loser, on the other hand, had to traipse around stark naked!<br>
<br>
"Hmmm... yes," Jordan said, "that sorority doesn't take any crap! OK, we'll see if they'd be willing to give us a hand."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Jordan and Bailey had scheduled their tournament to be held in two weeks. It wasn't that they needed that much time to hone their card-playing skills - in that regard, they were both ready to start the games immediately - rather, they needed some time to produce the loser's uniform.<br>
<br>
One thing they discovered they had missed had been footwear. They were in complete agreement that adequate footwear was a necessity to navigate the obstacle course, and they thus modified the first rule to include a pair of sneakers.<br>
<br>
They contacted the Beta Alpha Delta sorority about their proposal; happily, the sorority agreed to oversee the contest. They gave their solemn word that the loser would not be allowed to back out of their consequences.<br>
<br>
It was also decided that the sorority would be responsible for all rules concerning the obstacle course, including its configuration. The school's obstacle course could be set up in a variety of ways, from simple obstacles suitable for children all the way up to an expert-level challenge. Jordan and Bailey requested the sorority to set it at an intermediate level. Neither of them were super athletes, but they had experience with the course and could definitely handle a moderate level of difficulty. Ultimately, however, it would be up to the sorority to set up the course however they saw fit.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
As the days ticked by, Jordan struggled to come up with a suitable uniform for Bailey to wear, should she be the loser. The rules seemed far too restrictive; all Jordan's ideas seemed too tame - hardly embarrassing at all.<br>
<br>
Yet when she talked to Bailey about the uniforms, Bailey told her she had had no problems coming up with one, and in fact she had already finished preparing it!<br>
<br>
That of course bothered Jordan, and she redoubled her efforts. But another couple of days went by and the best she could come up with was a silly bunny costume. This consisted of a pair of shorts of the required length made from a stretchy material and with a fluffy bunny tail attached to the back. Accompanying this was a bare-midriff sleeveless top made from the same material. To complete the ensemble there was a pair of big, floppy bunny ears to be worn on Bailey's head.<br>
<br>
Granted, it would be pretty embarrassing having to wear that outfit, especially the top, since there would be no bra beneath it. Yet it just didn't seem enough.<br>
<br>
Not only was Jordan concerned about the inadequacy of her own creation, but she was also plenty worried about what Bailey had come up with! The girl had seemed so confident when she had talked to her. Had she come up with something really bad for Jordan to have to wear? Had she found some loophole in the rules?<br>
<br>
Jordan decided she had to know.<br>
<br>
She generally wasn't a dishonest individual, but there were limits. She felt that in this instance she was justified in bending the rules just a little. Nothing major, just a brief, temporary suspension of her usual standards. It would be a simple, harmless information-gathering exercise.<br>
<br>
In this vein, she struck up a conversation with a girl she knew, but not well. This girl, Kim was her name, was known for having the skills necessary to accomplish unsavory tasks - nothing too bad, just a little bad... exactly what Jordan needed.<br>
<br>
For a modest fee she agreed to help Jordan with her plight. In fact, since Bailey was scheduled to be in class for the next three hours, she agreed to help Jordan right away.<br>
<br>
The pair ambled over to Bailey's dorm building, then took the elevator to the third floor. They walked casually down the hallway until they reached Bailey's room. The door was closed and locked. Without a single bead of sweat forming, Kim picked the lock, then motioned for Jordan to enter.<br>
<br>
Since Bailey had the room to herself, there was no risk of encountering a roommate. Jordan, far more nervous than Kim, glanced up and down the hallway, then quickly opened the door and zoomed inside. She shut the door quietly behind her, Kim remaining outside to stand guard just in case Bailey would happen to return.<br>
<br>
Breathing shallow and fast, Jordan stood just inside the room, trying to look in all directions at once. She wanted to spend as little time in there as possible!<br>
<br>
The most obvious place to look was in the closet, the door to which was on the other side of the room. Jordan, trying to force herself to move quietly (but nevertheless stumbling once en route and nearly falling flat on her face), went over to the closet door, then opened it. Just inside, hanging on a peg attached to the wall, was what looked like a light blue gym uniform. Was that it? It had to be!<br>
<br>
There were two garments hanging there. She took the first - a pair of shorts - off the peg.<br>
<br>
"Holy shit!"<br>
<br>
Jordan's whispered exclamation was a direct result of her inspection of the garment. It was very much like her standard gym shorts except for the color... and the decorations on it! Right at the crotch there was a big, bright yellow smiley face with a long, dark red tongue sticking out, like it was all ready to lick something! Truly obscene!<br>
<br>
On the flip side there were two bright red "kiss marks," making it appear that a giant pair of lips had given her two huge smooches. If she were to wear those shorts there would be one kiss mark right smack in the center of each of her bottom cheeks!<br>
<br>
"I sure wouldn't want to be seen wearing this!" she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Putting the shorts aside, she took the other garment, a short-sleeved crop top, off the peg.<br>
<br>
In most respects the garment was fairly unremarkable. It would leave her tummy exposed - not an issue, although given the choice she would have preferred to have it covered. More of a concern was that the material was thin and stretchy, very similar to what she had used for the garments she had made for Bailey. Her braless breasts would put on quite a display in that thing.<br>
<br>
But the most noticeable feature of the top were the two bright yellow circles positioned right where her breasts would be, further emphasizing those anatomical features. Bailey had even gone a step further, having two small red circles inside the large yellow ones. They would be lined up with her nipples, making the garment, just like the shorts, pretty obnoxious!<br>
<br>
"Hey, maybe I could wear it backward," Jordan thought.<br>
<br>
But she immediately dismissed the idea. During their talks with the Beta Alpha Delta girls, it had been mentioned that the loser would have to wear their garment exactly as the winner had designed it. Wearing the top backward would violate that.<br>
<br>
Having gotten the information she needed, Jordan returned the garments to the peg, being careful to put them back as they were before.<br>
<br>
She shut the closet door, then walked across the room. She cracked open the room door and peered through. Kim motioned for her to come out, so she did so, quickly closing the door behind her. The two sauntered down the hallway to the elevator, rode it down, then left the building.<br>
<br>
Parting company with Kim, Jordan walked over to her own dorm building, located nearby. She had to think about what she had seen!<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The uniform Bailey had designed was actually pretty clever, Jordan had to admit, and it gave her some ideas for how she could improve her rabbit costume. Her first idea was to use a different color to emphasize Bailey's breasts. She would not, however, use bright yellow. Instead, Jordan decided she'd use a color that matched Jordan's skin. That would give the illusion that there were holes in the uniform, with Jordan's bare breasts sticking through them! To make it even more realistic she'd attach fake nipples to the flesh-colored material. Now THAT would be embarrassing!<br>
<br>
She could do something similar to the shorts, too. By carefully dying and drawing on the material at the crotch she could make it look like there was a hole cut out there. Yes, she'd draw a fake pussy right where the real one would be!<br>
<br>
Jordan was smiling now; she knew she was onto something. Although it would take a little work, she could do the same thing to the back of the shorts - make it appear that Bailey's bare bottom was exposed! She thought she'd be able to make it look pretty realistic, especially from a distance.<br>
<br>
She thought about it further. Instead of making it appear that there were holes in the material, should she instead make the entire uniform flesh colored? Could she make it appear that Bailey was completely nude?<br>
<br>
"Maybe, maybe..." she thought.<br>
<br>
To accomplish that, rather than a crop top it would probably be better to use something that came all the way down to the waist, otherwise it would be too obvious where the material ended and Bailey's actual skin began. The top should be long-sleeved as well. It would be the same for the shorts - they should come all the way down to the ankles.<br>
<br>
"Oh... but then they'd no longer be shorts, would they?" thought Jordan.<br>
<br>
"Wait a minute," Jordan instructed herself. "Do they HAVE to be shorts?"<br>
<br>
She pulled out a copy of the rules and focused in on rule 5:<br>
<br>
"The lower garment must come down to at least the same point as a pair of size Medium school gym shorts."<br>
<br>
When she and Bailey had come up with the rules, all they had been talking about was shorts. In fact their discussion covered them in great length, and had even turned into a big argument. But the rule only mentioned shorts as a reference point for the lower garment's length. The term "lower garment" could mean anything - a full length garment would be perfectly acceptable.<br>
<br>
<DING!><br>
<br>
There had been no actual bell sound, but there might as well have been, for an idea had just popped into Jordan's head. It was a clever idea. An evil idea.<br>
<br>
There was nothing in the rules forbidding her from making Bailey's lower garment a skirt!<br>
<br>
Although the length requirement was OK for shorts, a skirt of that length would be quite adventurous to wear. It would be an especially short mini - a micro, really. It would be embarrassing enough for Bailey to have to wear such a short skirt in public, but to wear it while racing through an obstacle course? Wow. Added to this was one small detail which would make the skirt particularly humiliating: Bailey would not be wearing any panties!<br>
<br>
"Oh, I couldn't do that. I just COULDN'T!"<br>
<br>
After a brief debate with her conscience, Jordan decided that she could.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Games day had arrived. Bailey and Jordan were sitting across from each other at a table, several pristine decks of cards close at hand. Two sorority representatives were there to keep an eye on things. This actually wasn't necessary, for neither of the two combatants had any intention of cheating, but the sorority was now in charge and that's how they wanted to do it.<br>
<br>
Strangely, this was one of the few times Bailey and Jordan had played by themselves. They nearly always played with a larger group, typically at least four people. Some of the rules for the games they were about to play had been adjusted to work with two players and to fit within the desired tournament time frame of approximately five hours.<br>
<br>
One of the sorority girls motioned to them, indicating they could begin.<br>
<br>
"Ready?" Bailey asked.<br>
<br>
Jordan gave a confirmatory nod.<br>
<br>
The cards were dealt and play began. Both girls had solemn, determined expressions on their faces. Even when playing casually they took their games seriously, but under these circumstances even more so. That was the reason neither would even consider cheating - in their eyes, such an act would sully the game.<br>
<br>
They started with Canasta, a game they were both fond of. Neither had any difficulty adjusting to the two-player version of the rules. At first Jordan and Bailey glanced frequently at each other, but as the game progressed the only thing they focused on was the cards. In fact, their level of concentration became so great that if someone had asked who their opponent was, they would not have been able to immediately answer.<br>
<br>
Bailey unconsciously left out a small grunt as Jordan placed the fourth red three in front of her. Jordan made a similar sound when Bailey grabbed a hefty discard pile. The two battled back and forth, neck and neck, as time flew by. Unlike their typical games, there were no inflammatory comments, no banging of cards on the table, no sneers or chuckles.<br>
<br>
When it was over, Bailey had won, but not by much.<br>
<br>
They took a short break before starting the next game. Although Jordan had lost the first, it was far too early for her to worry. She thought about the uniform she had prepared for her opponent. She had kept the original sleeveless top, not bothering to make any changes to it. She had also kept the bunny ears. But instead of the shorts there was now a severely length-challenged maroon skirt. If Bailey lost, she was in for the surprise of her life! What a show there would be!<br>
<br>
Then Jordan thought about the alternative: losing. Well, she'd really hate to be seen wearing the lewd costume Bailey had made, but at least everything would be covered. But there was no point wasting time thinking along those lines - she needed to put all of her thoughts and efforts into winning!<br>
<br>
The tournament proceeded, the games blurring together into one long, exciting contest. It was exciting for the two contestants, at least. After the first hour the two sorority girls were getting pretty drowsy. After the second, they had to take turns waking each other up. And after the third, they were both sound asleep, sitting at opposite ends of the table with their heads resting on their arms.<br>
<br>
The tournament score stayed as close as the individual games that were played. Jordan won the second game, Gin Rummy, tying things up at one apiece. Winning at Pinochle pulled her ahead by one, but then Bailey tied it up again by winning at Hearts.<br>
<br>
After eight games, each girl had four wins. The ninth and deciding game would be Spades. They had been playing for over four hours now, with only short breaks between games, yet neither player was tired.<br>
<br>
They didn't play Spades all that often, and Jordan had never played it 2-handed before. It seemed that her opponent was just a little better at it than she was, for Bailey gained a small advantage early on and gradually added to it as the game progressed. Her lead wasn't insurmountable, yet it definitely made things more difficult for Jordan.<br>
<br>
Late in the game, Jordan began to close the gap, but she was running out of time. Then came the moment of truth: she had drawn an especially good hand. If she played it correctly it could propel her into the lead!<br>
<br>
Jordan thought about it carefully before announcing her bid. She took so long to decide that Bailey looked over at her... not with annoyance, just with curiosity. Seeing Bailey watching her, Jordan made up her mind. Overcautiousness at this point would be her undoing; she had to be bold. She SO wanted for Bailey to have to wear the uniform she had made for her!<br>
<br>
When she announced her bid, Bailey's eyebrows rose a bit. "Uh oh," Jordan thought. "I hope I didn't overbid."<br>
<br>
Well, it was too late now. It would be close, but she knew that before bidding. She couldn't afford any slipups though - not a one!<br>
<br>
The game started well, Jordan taking trick after trick. But towards the end of the hand Bailey took a couple herself - just enough so that Jordan missed her bid by a single trick. With a zero score, Jordan was now hopelessly behind, and Bailey won the game - and the tournament - on the very next hand.<br>
<br>
"Crap," thought Jordan, thinking ahead to the embarrassing task which now lay before her.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The sounds of victory emerging from Bailey woke the two sorority girls.<br>
<br>
"Huh?" said one.<br>
<br>
"What?" said the other.<br>
<br>
Bailey was smiling. Jordan was frowning. Based on this evidence, the Beta Alpha Delta pair were able to deduce the results of the tournament they were supposed to have been monitoring.<br>
<br>
Fully awake now, the two sorority girls walked with Jordan to a room which had an exit to the obstacle course. Neither Jordan nor Bailey had seen the course as configured by the sorority, so the exact layout would be a surprise.<br>
<br>
Embarrassingly, Jordan had to undress and give her clothes to the pair. Then they left.<br>
<br>
Now naked and alone in the room, Jordan walked over to a table in the corner on which rested a box and a pair of sneakers. On the wall above the table were the six uniform rules she and Bailey had agreed to. She was already plenty familiar with them so she just gave them a quick glance.<br>
<br>
She took the lid off the box, then frowned. The garments inside were navy blue.<br>
<br>
"This isn't my uniform," she muttered.<br>
<br>
Her frown deepened as she took the uniform out of the box. She had expected there to be a top and a pair of shorts. Instead, the uniform consisted of five pieces, and it wasn't at all obvious to her how they were to be worn.<br>
<br>
She inspected the pieces more closely. Each piece was simply a tube of material, open at each end. These varied in size: there were two long, thin ones, two long, wider ones, and one which was shorter but much wider than all the others. Obviously some assembly was required, but she didn't see any snaps, buttons, zippers, or even Velcro on any of the pieces.<br>
<br>
She noticed an envelope at the bottom of the box. Taking it out, she opened it and removed two folded papers. Unfolding the first, she read:<br>
<br>
"Hi Jordan. I wasn't happy when I found out that you had broken into my room to sneak a peek at my uniform. I got over it though, so no hard feelings, even though I had to spend a lot of time and effort preparing a new one for you! I had to make a new one from scratch, you understand, otherwise it wouldn't have been a surprise! I hope you enjoy your new uniform. XOXO Bailey."<br>
<br>
"Whatever," groused Jordan. She wasn't thrilled that her activities had been discovered, and the 'XOXO' annoyed her, for she was definitely NOT on XOXO terms with Bailey!<br>
<br>
She looked at the uniform again. There were no embarrassing decorations on it, unlike the prior version. Once she figured out how to get it on, it actually didn't seem like it would be embarrassing at all.<br>
<br>
She unfolded the second paper. It was a diagram which illustrated exactly how the uniform was to be worn.<br>
<br>
"Oh, come on, Bailey," she complained, for the uniform clearly violated the rules. Obviously Bailey was just trying to be funny; Jordan looked around the room to see if there was another box with her REAL uniform in it, but she didn't see one.<br>
<br>
"Where's my uniform?" she called through the outside door. A sorority girl called back: "It's in the box on the table."<br>
<br>
This joke had worn thin, in fact it hadn't been the least bit funny right from the start. Jordan already wasn't in the best of moods, having just been defeated by her rival, and this wasn't helping.<br>
<br>
"This uniform's illegal. It doesn't follow the rules," she called back.<br>
<br>
"What rule does it violate?" asked the sorority girl.<br>
<br>
Jordan didn't have the rules memorized THAT well, not by number, so she walked over to the list on the wall. Focusing in on rule 5, she opened her mouth to call back. Rereading the rule, she closed her mouth again:<br>
<br>
"The lower garment must come down to at least the same point as a pair of size Medium school gym shorts."<br>
<br>
"uhoh" a voice whispered in her mind.<br>
<br>
She focused in on the phrase, "... must come down to at least..."<br>
<br>
She looked back at the picture.<br>
<br>
Well, since the garment as pictured came all the way down to her ankles, it actually DID fulfill the rule's requirement. But...<br>
<br>
She walked over to the door.<br>
<br>
"I am NOT wearing this thing!!!" she called out firmly.<br>
<br>
"Hey girls, did you hear that?" said a voice on the other side of the door.<br>
<br>
Then she heard several voices, all vying for attention:<br>
<br>
"Wanna BET?"<br>
<br>
"Oh yes you will."<br>
<br>
"Would you like us to come in and help you?"<br>
<br>
"You'd BETTER!"<br>
<br>
There then followed some indications about what would happen if she continued with her obstinate behavior. The first was that her hands would be tied behind her back and she'd be marched stark naked all throughout the campus. Another was that she'd be tied to a tree, naked and spread-eagled, right in front of the student union building and left there for the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
Those were the mildest of the suggestions; from there they went downhill. Jordan clearly did not have a choice in the matter - she was going to have to honor her agreement!<br>
<br>
"OK OK," she said through the door so the increasingly vile suggestions emanating from the other side would cease.<br>
<br>
Maybe there was still a way out; she tried going back through the interior door through which she had first entered. Ugh, locked.<br>
<br>
"Nice try," said a girl's voice from the other side.<br>
<br>
What about trying to climb out of a window? Crap... this room didn't have any. A trap door in the ceiling, like for access to an attic? No, no trap doors in the ceiling. A trapdoor in the floor? Nope. A ventilation shaft? There had to be one there somewhere! Oh... well, there was one, but unless she got hit with a shrink ray it wasn't going to be very helpful.<br>
<br>
Having exhausted all exit possibilities she could think of, Jordan walked back over to the table and picked up the diagram. She swallowed several times, then began to dress.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Jordan put on the first two pieces of her uniform: long, fairly narrow tubes of a stretchy fabric. They fit on her arms, extending from her shoulders all the way down to her wrists. Then she moved on to the next pair; these were made of the same material but longer and wider. One at a time, she pulled them onto her legs - they extended from her upper thighs down to her ankles.<br>
<br>
There was one more piece available to her, much wider than the others but not as long. She consulted the diagram just to ascertain what she already knew. She stuck her head and arms through it, then pulled it down to her waist.<br>
<br>
All that remained was her sneakers; she put these on her feet and tied them. Now she was all ready to take a run through the obstacle course... except she wasn't ready at all!<br>
<br>
She went back and reread rules 5 and 6 several times, but it didn't help. The trouble was that both rules specified how far DOWN the garments had to come, but there was no mention about where the garments needed to START from. She had assumed the lower garment would start from the waist and the upper one from the neck, yet that assumption was not actually stated.<br>
<br>
Jordan's arms and legs were completely covered with the dark blue material. Also, her torso was covered from the top of her stomach down to her waist. That was it. Everything else was left uncovered. There was nothing at all between her upper legs and her waist. Similarly, there wasn't a shred of material covering anything above her stomach. It was like her uniform was in reverse - everything that didn't need to be covered was covered completely, but the things that HAD to be covered were exposed!<br>
<br>
Looking down at herself she thought, "I can't go out in public like THIS!"<br>
<br>
"You have one minute!" a voice from outside warned.<br>
<br>
Jordan walked slowly toward the exit door.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
A minute later, the door was yanked open and two girls barged in. Both looked annoyed.<br>
<br>
Jordan had spent the last minute standing near the door, unable to get herself to open it. Now that it had been opened for her, she walked right past the two girls and went outside before they had a chance to react.<br>
<br>
Feeling the cool outside air against her skin, she took stock of her surroundings, trying to get a grip on a situation that was completely unlike anything she had ever experienced. The entryway to the obstacle course, a white archway with the curving word 'Entrance' overhead, was a short distance in front of her. There were a number of sorority girls - at least twenty of them - scattered about, wearing red sweatshirts with their sorority letters in yellow. They were all watching her. To the right, a couple of students, both young men, were jogging on a macadam path which ran alongside the course.<br>
<br>
She heard the door close behind her. Glancing back at it, she saw the two girls who had entered the room standing there with their arms folded. They had positioned themselves directly in front of the door. There was no going back.<br>
<br>
She saw a few other students walking farther down the path, then her attention returned to the two joggers. As she watched, one of them glanced over in her direction. He stopped in his tracks, an expression of astonishment on his face. Then he pointed right at her, generally not really a polite thing to do but not unreasonable under the circumstances. The other jogger, wondering why his partner had stopped, looked over at him. His eyes followed his friend's outstretched arm to its indicated destination - comprehension dawned, accompanied by great interest.<br>
<br>
With a yelp, Jordan put her left arm over her breasts and her right hand between her legs.<br>
<br>
"You won't get your clothes back until you finish the course," a sorority girl pointed out.<br>
<br>
Frozen in place, Jordan tried to think - it wasn't easy. She couldn't retreat. She couldn't just keep standing there. Her only way was forward, but that was completely unacceptable!<br>
<br>
A young woman, also out for a jog, began to pass by the pair of young men. She turned her head to see what they were staring at. Her eyes widening, she came to a sudden stop. Jordan heard a gasp as the woman brought her hand up to her mouth.<br>
<br>
"The longer I stay here," Jordan thought, "the more students will gather!"<br>
<br>
Like it or not, there was simply no choice.<br>
<br>
Keeping herself covered as best she could, she began to trot awkwardly toward the entrance to the obstacle course, her mind a chaotic swirl of embarrassment and disbelief.<br>
<br>
As she neared the entrance, she realized the trio of spectators were now behind her. That meant they could see her bare bottom! She began to move her arms behind her in an attempt to cover her backside, but then she spotted some more students on the path ahead of her. Wanting to minimize the damage, she moved her arms back to their original positions over her crotch and breasts. Her face began to glow red as she imagined what she must look like from the back.<br>
<br>
Jordan went through the entry arch and reached her first obstacle. This was simply two sets of rubber tires arranged side-by-side on the ground, stretching forward about 15 feet. To navigate them she had to first place her right foot in one tire, then her left in the tire aside of it, then step forward with her right to the next tire in front, and so on until she reached the end. Normally this obstacle could be negotiated fairly quickly, but trying to do it while her hands were occupied made it much more difficult.<br>
<br>
Slowly, one step at a time, she proceeded through the tires. She nearly tripped twice along the way, but finally made it to the end. A glance over to the path revealed that a few more students had added themselves to the group. Seeing the expressions on their faces - astonishment, curiosity, enjoyment, and amusement - made her face grow even hotter.<br>
<br>
Turning away from her admirers, she examined the next obstacle.<br>
<br>
"Oh no," she groaned.<br>
<br>
Before her was a set of hurdles placed at regular intervals over a smooth dirt track which was situated directly aside of the macadam jogging path. There were a number of students on the path that she'd have to pass by along the way. Unfortunately it would be nearly impossible for her to handle the hurdles while covering herself - if she tried, she'd almost certainly fall... multiple times.<br>
<br>
She stood there indecisively for a few moments, then realized once again there was no decision to make.<br>
<br>
"I have to keep going, otherwise this'll never end!"<br>
<br>
She began to sprint, her arms pumping at her sides. The cool air rushed against her; it felt truly bizarre. She couldn't feel it against her arms or legs, nor her stomach or lower back, for those areas were covered by her uniform. On the other hand, she felt it flowing over her breasts, rushing between her legs, and caressing her bottom. It made it impossible for her to forget, even for a moment, how completely exposed she was. Some obnoxious whistles impinging on her ears confirmed it: she was showing it all!<br>
<br>
She reached the first hurdle and leaped into the air. As she cleared it, her one leg was stretched out in front of her and the other was stretched out behind. She held this aerial split for just an instant, then landed and immediately went back into a sprint.<br>
<br>
As she raced through the hurdles, the dark blue of her uniform provided stark contrast to her light-complexioned skin. It was as if she had a spotlight shining on her, one that only lit up the bare areas. It emphasized her nudity, pulling the eyes of onlookers right toward her secrets. This was exactly why Bailey has chosen that particular color. Not that Jordan's secrets needed any help drawing attention to themselves - with her running and jumping, some of them were putting on quite a show!<br>
<br>
She cleared the final hurdle, then ran a short distance to the next obstacle - a set of monkey bars. This was like a horizontal ladder, mounted overhead, with rounded rungs. It was positioned so that as she traversed it she'd be facing away from the macadam path.<br>
<br>
Like the hurdles, she'd be unable to cover herself while meeting this challenge. She decided to not even try; instead she was going to put her full effort into getting past the obstacle just as quickly as she possibly could. Taking a glance back toward the path, she saw that there was now a group of eight or nine people watching her, and more were coming.<br>
<br>
Getting herself into position, she stretched her arms up over her head, then jumped up and grabbed the first rung. Dangling from the bar she knew the spectators were getting a perfect view of her from the rear, but there was no help for it. After just the briefest of pauses to ensure her position was stable, she swung herself forward and grabbed the next bar, first with her one hand and then the other. She repeated this procedure, moving forward rung by rung. Her speed was impressive, for she was highly motivated.<br>
<br>
Ahead and to the left, she spotted Bailey watching her with a big grin on her face. Bailey was standing near a couple of sorority girls and was apparently enjoying Jordan's plight. It was bad enough having to put on a totally humiliating show for a small group of spectators, but having to perform in front of her gloating rival made it much worse!<br>
<br>
"I can't let her distract me," Jordan told herself. She looked away from Bailey and continued forward. Soon she was three quarters of the way through.<br>
<br>
"Hey, you can't DO that!" someone behind her said in a loud voice.<br>
<br>
"This is too good to pass up," a young man's voice argued back.<br>
<br>
Jordan stopped and glanced over at Baily. Baily was no longer watching her; instead she was looking intently at something behind her.<br>
<br>
Jordan twisted around to see what was going on. There was a young man behind her pointing his phone right at her!<br>
<br>
"But that's not allowed!!" Jordan silently complained, for the school's policy, enacted earlier in the year to try to address student privacy concerns, forbid taking pictures of other students without first obtaining permission. The only exception was students working for the school newspaper, and they had to wear lime green caps to clearly identify themselves. This would-be photographer was hatless.<br>
<br>
The young man did not appear to care that he was violating the regulations. He was making adjustments on his phone, trying to maximize the quality of his planned shot.<br>
<br>
Jordan untwisted herself; she had to finish this obstacle posthaste!<br>
<br>
<CLICK><br>
<br>
Jordan heard the digitally reproduced sound of a shutter clicking. The young man had just taken picture of her posterior for posterity.<br>
<br>
Distracted and trying to go too fast, Jordan slipped and fell onto the soft padding below her. She quickly jumped up, grabbed the rung she had fallen from, and proceeded forward.<br>
<br>
"You have to go back to the start," a sorority girl told her.<br>
<br>
"But..."<br>
<br>
Jordan was going to argue, but there was no point. The rules stipulated that each obstacle had to be traversed correctly. Earlier, that had prevented her from simply running around the hurdles instead of jumping over them, and now the rules forced her to run back to the beginning of the monkey bars to try again.<br>
<br>
<CLICK><br>
<br>
The young man clicked off another picture as she was running back to the start. Apparently his definition of acceptable subject material included front views, as well as back.<br>
<br>
This time Jordan successfully navigated the bars, although she heard several more loud clicks while doing so. It was bad enough she was being photographed, but couldn't the picture taker have at least lowered the volume of the fake shutter sounds, or better yet turned them off completely?<br>
<br>
With the monkey bars now behind her, she moved to the next challenge: a rope traversal. This obstacle consisted of three ropes. One was about three feet off the ground and stretched out about twenty feet. There was padding under it in case of a fall. The other two were higher and positioned on each side of the first rope. The idea was to walk along the lower rope while holding onto the two upper ropes to maintain balance. Jordan had done this type of thing before - it wasn't particularly difficult provided she didn't try to go too fast.<br>
<br>
Using a set of portable stairs, she grabbed onto the two upper ropes, one in each hand, and then stepped out onto the lower rope. She took a careful step forward to begin her journey.<br>
<br>
The rope on which Jordan was walking headed back toward the macadam path. She could see that the group of spectators had grown to about a dozen students, and there were now THREE of them taking photos. Apparently the rule-breaking behavior of the young man who had taken the first pictures was contagious. She hoped none of those pictures ended up being posted on the internet! They probably wouldn't, since that would greatly increase the chances of repercussions from the school. Even so, she really would have preferred to NOT have super-embarrassing pictures of her populating students' photo collections!<br>
<br>
Oops! Her one foot slipped, almost causing her to lose her balance. "Focus! Focus!" she thought. The last thing she wanted was to have to go back to the beginning to try again! She deliberately pulled her attention away from her audience.<br>
<br>
Slowly, concentrating as best she could, she progressed along the rope. She was about a third of the way along when she heard a noise to her left. A quick glance revealed it was Bailey, still looking most annoyingly cheerful.<br>
<br>
"I wish SHE was the one up here!" Jordan muttered. Then she wisely turned away from Bailey and directed her gaze down to the rope she was traversing.<br>
<br>
But even though she was no longer looking at her, Jordan's thoughts were stuck on Bailey; that girl had gotten her as badly as she had ever been gotten in her life!<br>
<br>
She was really going to tell her off, just as soon as she was done with the obstacle course. No, that wasn't enough. Instead, she'd never speak to her again. No, that wouldn't do either. Could she tell her off and not speak to her at the same time? That would be ideal.<br>
<br>
Fuming about Bailey and fighting the intense humiliation which had plagued her right from the start, she passed the halfway point. She could see another set of portable stairs positioned just where the rope ended. She'd use those to dismount. Near those steps was a long, red mat. Like the hurdles, it ran right aside of the jogging path. It ran all the way up to the course's exit archway, off to the left. What was that about? That had to be the final obstacle, but it wasn't obvious what that obstacle would entail.<br>
<br>
But now wasn't the time to be thinking about the next obstacle. She had to keep concentrating on THIS one!<br>
<br>
She went a little farther, then some impulse made her take a quick look to the right.<br>
<br>
"Oh!"<br>
<br>
Surprised and dismayed by what she saw, she came to a stop. Off in the distance there was a huge group of people approaching, coming up the macadam path which would lead them right to her! They were still some distance off, but that situation wasn't going to last for long. Apparently word of her activities - and in particular her state of dress - had gotten around. It looked like the entire school was coming! Even worse, she could see some lime green caps scattered throughout the mob. Reporters for the school paper! She had to get out of there... NOW!<br>
<br>
Jordan moved forward at a reckless pace, knowing that if she slipped and fell there was no way she could reach the end of the course before the mob reached her. The world was a blur. She could hear noises coming from her small, nearby group of watchers, but the sounds of her own exertions were mostly drowning them out.<br>
<br>
Then... she was there! She had reached the end of the rope! Her recklessness had paid off! Down the steps she flew, right to the start of the mat. Was she supposed to just run on the mat the rest of the way?<br>
<br>
Then she saw a sorority girl pointing at a sign she hadn't noticed before; it was situated just to the left of the matting a short distance in front of her. It showed a silhouette of a person crawling.<br>
<br>
Now she knew exactly what she had to do.<br>
<br>
"But this isn't a standard obstacle!" she complained, for this particular obstacle wasn't one that was typically used. It wasn't that it was too difficult; if anything, it was too easy for an intermediate-level setup. But unfortunately the sorority had decided to include it, so she was stuck with it.<br>
<br>
She got down on her hands and knees and began to crawl, moving forward as quickly as she could. She was now offering a particularly lewd exhibition of herself. Not only were her breasts bouncing and jiggling as if they were possessed, but her bottom was wriggling back and forth like she had ants in her pants (although of course she had neither). To make matters worse, her legs were not nearly tight enough together, a fact of which she was acutely aware.<br>
<br>
Since the mat was positioned directly aside of the path, her audience was getting an excellent close-up view of everything. They signified their enthusiasm with a variety of loud sounds - whistles, laughter, catcalls, and cheering.<br>
<br>
She reached a point where there was a bright yellow line painted across the matting. Just to the left was another sign - another silhouette showing what she was supposed to do.<br>
<br>
She got down on her back and stretched herself out across the mat, her arms raised over her head. Then she began to roll, just like a log.<br>
<br>
Doing log rolls might not have been quite as humiliating as crawling on her hands and knees, but it was close. As she rolled along she kept presenting different views of herself - first the front and then the rear. If any of her admirers had a preference, all they needed to do was wait a bit and their favorite view would come around. Most members of her audience, however, were quite interested in both views, so for them Jordan's log rolls were a source of continuous entertainment.<br>
<br>
As enjoyable as this exercise was for the spectators, for Jordan it was just the opposite. First she'd feel the mat pressing reassuringly against her bare bottom, knowing it was hidden from view but at the same time aware that her flip side was presenting itself to the audience. Then a moment later the front of her body would be nestled against the mat, but she'd feel the cool air against her bottom and know it was exposed for all to see. She had to continually fight against the urge to curl up into a ball.<br>
<br>
But she knew she had to keep pressing onward, so she bravely rolled along - not pausing even once - until she reached another yellow line.<br>
<br>
She stopped then and tried to stand up, but she was a little too dizzy. Crouching down while waiting for the dizziness to let up, she glanced back down the path. The big crowd was much closer now! It would be there in no time!<br>
<br>
She had to move, otherwise every single one of her classmates was going to see her! And if that wasn't bad enough, there were the reporters for the school paper. Unfortunately the school had no control over the paper - if those reporters caught up to her there'd be a photoset of her in the next printing! There'd be pictures galore on the paper's web site, too, and undoubtedly movies as well! She was already feeling plenty embarrassed, but it would be NOTHING compared to what she'd be feeling if the mob caught up to her!<br>
<br>
She turned and looked at what lay ahead. There were no more yellow lines on the mat, just a thick white line which marked the finish. This would be her last exercise! She glanced over at the sign to see what it was.<br>
<br>
"Oh great... cartwheels!"<br>
<br>
Although her dizziness had started to subside, it wasn't completely gone yet and her next activity would not help! If she tried doing cartwheels now she'd likely as not fall flat on her face!<br>
<br>
She had to try. Standing up, arms overhead, she threw her weight to the side to begin her rotation. A moment later she was upside down with both hands flat against the mat and her legs above her. Still turning, she came back around until she was right-side up again. One down, a bunch to go!<br>
<br>
Like a rolling pinwheel, she moved down the mat, successfully performing one cartwheel after the next. From her perspective the people on the path, trotting to keep up with her, were spinning wildly. They were loud and exuberant... not surprising, considering that her legs were spread wide apart when she was upside down. Over the din she could also hear the growing sounds of the approaching mob.<br>
<br>
"Whoa! Whoa! Stop!" a female voice called.<br>
<br>
All of the sudden there were hands all over her, holding her upright and stopping her from any further progress.<br>
<br>
"You've crossed the line; you're at the end of the mat," the voice explained.<br>
<br>
Although the world was spinning around her, the message had been received and understood. She had done it! She had reached the finish!<br>
<br>
"Where are my clothes?" Jordan squeaked, for there was no time to lose!<br>
<br>
She could see now that she was surrounded by sorority girls in their red sweatshirts. They were still holding onto her, which was just as well because she would have fallen over otherwise.<br>
<br>
"They're back in the room you started from," one of the girls informed her.<br>
<br>
"WHAT???"<br>
<br>
Jordan hadn't expected that! She didn't have time to run all the way back there, not with most, if not all, of the school nearly upon her!<br>
<br>
"Go this way," another girl said.<br>
<br>
Then the girls surrounding her - there were four of them - helpfully guided Jordan to a place where the ground slopped downward. They guided her downhill, then stopped when the land leveled off again.<br>
<br>
"Just wait here until you're ready, then head back to the start."<br>
<br>
Jordan wanted to follow the second part of the girl's instructions immediately, but she was still too dizzy. Having little choice she sat down to wait, her bottom cheeks pressing into the soft grass.<br>
<br>
She looked around in a panic, fully expecting to see a whole lot of people watching her. She could certainly HEAR people - lots of them - very close by! But other than the four girls, who were now walking away from her back up the slope, she saw no one. Now she could see why: she was in a deep ravine, whose sloping sides were high enough to keep her out of sight. That was fortunate! But she still needed to get her clothes!<br>
<br>
A short while later she stood up. She was still a little wobbly, but not so much that she couldn't walk. She began to follow the ravine, walking away from the downslope where she had entered it. She was hoping it would take her close to the building she had started from, although even if it did she'd still need to break cover to get inside.<br>
<br>
Now that the dizziness had passed she picked up her pace, first walking quickly then trotting, the roar of the nearby mob accompanying her every step. Before too long she reached the ravine's end. There was a building there - just as she had hoped, it was the building she had started from! Even better, there was a sub-ground door she could use to get inside unseen! Once in the building, she'd just need to go up a flight of stairs, then get to the room with her clothes.<br>
<br>
But there was a pair of sorority girls standing aside of the doorway. Were they going to give her problems? She'd soon see. She walked up to the door, then tried to open it. It was locked!<br>
<br>
"Could you unlock this for me please?" she asked the one girl, having to nearly shout to be heard above the unseen crowd. She was not expecting a helpful response.<br>
<br>
"Sure," the girl replied, "as soon as you're done."<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
"Congratulations!" the other girl said enthusiastically. "You've reached the halfway point! Now you just need to go through the obstacle course one more time!"<br><br><br>
