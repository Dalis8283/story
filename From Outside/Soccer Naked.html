 style="font-size: 12pt;">The new Women’s World Soccer League debuts this
Saturday at the league’s opener in Chicago.<span style="">  </span>With its
six teams in Chicago, Montreal, Mexico City, New York, Los Angeles and Dallas
this ‘World’ league will struggle to capture a piece of the summer sports
market.<span style="">  </span>I, for one, wish it luck but feel that it
will not do well in the American market.<span style="">  </span>Soccer.<span
 style="">  </span>Outside of the Mexico City franchise the local apathy
to soccer will lead insufficient loyal fans to keep the league afloat financially.<span
 style="">  </span>The league’s inability to recruit any of the top athletes
from the recent women’s World Cup competition casts a doubt on the league
owners’ willingness to pay a respectable salary.<span style="">  </span>Rather,
I suspect it is that the top women players are holding out for a better opportunity.<span
 style="">  </span>I for one will be present for the opener and cheer these
women on.<span style="">  </span>After the recent strikes in baseball and
basketball it will be nice to see some players who play for the love of the
game AND the fans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attendance is already causing talk of bankruptcy for two of the six teams.<span

per game, I fear the WWSL players and owners alike will soon find themselves

was right.<span style="">  </span>The women were playing very good soccer
and the advertising should have drawn the fans.<span style="">  </span>Fans
just did not want to see so any 1-0 scores or scoreless ties.<span

death overtime period, defense ruled the games and made them boring to the
average American sports fan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to keep her breasts in her bra.<span style="">  </span>She was luckier than

Belles had scored a goal half way through the second quarter and now led
1-0.<span style="">  </span>As the end of the first half approached, the
NY Knickers were driven.<span style="">  </span>Three Knickers passed the
ball between them before making a break toward Bridget’s goal.<span

focused.<span style="">  </span>The crowd roar was picking up as the three
out-raced the Belles and drove to the center of the field in front of the

quickly before the woman of the right kicked it.<span style="">  </span>Bridget
drove to her left and felt both her breasts pop free as the ball passed Bridget’s

did not celebrate yet. If the score remained tied, both teams would lose
their short tight shorts.<span style="">  </span>Bridget saw the Knickers
take possession of the ball immediately and she once again faced three players
charging to the goal.<span style="">  </span>The Knickers saw that only three 
seconds remained and with their breasts bouncing free of their bras they
rushed the kick.<span style="">  </span>Bridget seemed to fly as her outstretched

it now impossible to keep her breasts in her nearly useless bra.<span

panties.<span style="">  </span>Whenever she moved she needed at least one 
hand to pull up one side or the other.<span style="">  </span>The other players
had to run with one or both hands at their waists. Bridget watched in horror
as one player and then another forgot to hold up their panties only to find
that after a few steps their panties were around their thighs or knees.<span
 style="">  </span>Bridget’s horror turned to fear as one of her teammates
charged the Knickers goal only to have her panties trip her up as they dropped
to and wrapped around her ankles.<span style="">  </span>While Bridget’s
teammate tried to pull her rebellious panties back up her legs, Bridget watched
the Knickers drive back at the Belles goal.<span style="">  </span>Bridget
reluctantly ignored her own panties.<span style="">  </span>Her vision narrowed
down to just the Knickers with the ball.<span style="">    </span>She ignored
her teammates rushing to help her and saw the Knicker prepare to kick.<span

fly directly into her outreached hands as her body struck the grassy field.<span
 style="">  </span>She smiled and held the ball triumphantly as the crowd
cheered even louder than ever before.<span style="">  </span>Her smile crumbled
as she turned and saw a pair of red lacy panties lying in front of the goal.<span
 style="">  </span>She looked down to see that her shaven pussy was exposed
to the world.<span style="">  </span>Before she could act a Knickers player 
scooped up Bridget’s panties and ran toward the Knickers end of the field.<span

her teammates yelling at her to kick the ball out.<span style="">  </span>If
Bridget continued to just hold the ball, a penalty could be accessed.<span

kicked it as strong as she could.<span style="">  </span>Her all but naked

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The rest of
the quarter continued in a defensive frenzy.<span style="">  </span>The score
remained tied and no attempts were made on Bridget’s goal.<span style=""> 
</span>That was good for the Belles because Bridget spent most of her time
crouched next to a goal post in an unsuccessful attempt to cover her most 
private of areas.<span style="">  </span>She realized she was stuck with
no help available until the game ended.<span style="">  </span>The new rules
said that any clothing retrieved by and opponent was forfeited for the rest
of the game.<span style="">  </span>The other Belles realized Bridget was
too embarrassed to defend their goal and feared they might soon suffer the
same fate.<span style="">  </span>With no offense the Belles were doomed,
but they’d take the Knickers down to doom too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the fourth quarter Bridget was completely naked save for her shoes and
socks.<span style="">  </span>Both teams had had to surrender their bras,
which in Bridget's case was her only clothing above her ankles.<span

period that they would all play naked if the score remained unchanged.<span

seesawed back and forth in the middle of the field.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bridget realized
her team’s dilemma.<span style="">  </span>If Bridget continued to cringe
behind the goal post, she would doom her team to the double humiliation of
a loss and being naked.<span style="">  </span>She slowly concentrated and
blocked all thoughts except the desire to win.<span style="">  </span>With
no players on either team watching her, but thousands in the stands enjoying
her naked splendor, she stood up straight and raced down a sideline.<span
 style="">  </span>Upon reaching mid-field she turned to the center and charged
into the battle with her breasts giggling vigorously.<span style="">  </span>Her
naked legs became a blur as she intercepted the ball and drove toward the
Knickers net.<span style="">  </span>Players on both teams were caught unaware
as Bridget’s all too naked and spectacular body moved as if propelled by
a jet engine.<span style="">  </span>A few moments passed before they reacted.<span

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With the goal
score Bridget’s concentration broke.<span style="">  </span>She froze standing
with her legs at least three feet apart.<span style="">  </span>Her heavy 
breathing made her magnificient breasts the target of all eyes.<span
 style="">  </span>Her sweat covered flesh glistened in the bright sunlight.<span
 style="">  </span>She broke toward her goal while the pandemonium continued.<span

normal defensive stance in front of her own goal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Knickers
spirit had gone out of them.<span style="">  </span>They tried to mount an
offensive, but the now invigorated Belles became an impenetrable defensive
wall.<span style="">  </span>When Bridget heard the buzzer at the end of the
game her composure evaporated.<span style="">  </span>She raced toward the
tunnel that led to the locker rooms only to find it blocked by photographers
and reporters.<span style="">  </span>Cameras flashed on all sides of her
as the male journalists and fans crowded around her.<span style="">  </span>Bridget
was the star of the game and they all wanted a piece of her in more ways
than journalistically appropriate.<span style="">  </span>Bridget felt herself
being lifted was placed on the shoulders of a shirtless beefy male fan.<span
 style="">  </span>Her breasts bounced against his scalp as he jogged back
out to the field and a celebration exploded with the rest of the fans pouring
onto the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

herself on nude display to thousands, the now naked Knickers players fought
their way to their locker room only to find it locked.<span style="">  </span>They
cowered with their hands over their crotches and breasts.<span style=""> 
</span>Vernon Etmond stood beside the door and told the Knickers that as the
losers they had to go out and sign autographs for thirty minutes.<span

we will charge you with breach of contract and insist that you be arrested
right now.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

barely hold back a smile.<span style="">  </span>“Then you will never play
soccer, as a professional or amateur again.<span style="">  </span>If that

on Etmond’s face.<span style="">  </span>“I’m sorry, but if you are in breach

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The new Women’s
World Soccer League has finally scored with the American fans.<span
 style="">  </span>The new, rather unorthodox rule changes have resulted
in sold out games at every event for the last two weeks.<span style="">  </span>This
is not the soccer seen elsewhere in the world, but it is already proving
to be an entertaining sport.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rumors of a
threatened players’ strike and law suit were dashed today when in uncharacteristically
swift move an appellate court in New York ruled yesterday that league contracts
with the players were legal and thoroughly binding.<span style="">  </span>The
court ordered the players to appear and play at all regularly scheduled games.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yes, this new
adult oriented soccer league is here to stay for at least the three seasons
specified in those same contracts.<span style="">  </span>So, either stay
away or come and enjoy, but it is going to be with us for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
