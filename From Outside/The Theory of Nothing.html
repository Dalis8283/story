<p lang="en-US"> <strong style="font-size:2em; text-transform: uppercase; font-weight:bold;">Original</strong><br><br><br>
It was the middle of the night that saw Ami out and about at the oddest of hours. She simply couldn't sleep; she had tossed, turned, fretted- sheer restlessness that wouldn't abate. Eventually she resigned that sleep was not coming to her anytime soon - so the pajama-clad girl climbed out of bed, rubbed at her eyes, slipped on some sandals and left her apartment. Maybe it was instinctive, maybe she was half-asleep... maybe she was totally asleep. Nonetheless, before long Ami found herself outside the moonlit confines of the school's indoor swimming facilities. It was a little known secret that the staff seldom if ever locked up like they should have. There was nothing of value to take, maybe they just didn't see a point... and no one ever went there after hours anyway.<br>
<br>
Little did they know, there was the exception of a certain isolated swimmer. Ami often went by in the late evening to clear her thoughts, sometimes even for a quick swim.. but never that late. She'd gone at 6, 7, 8... but never in the middle of the night. The streets were absolutely deserted. It was 2, maybe 3 in the morning... a ridiculous time for a girl to be out alone, and yet there Ami was, slipping into the pool facility's confines without a second thought. At some point the girl had left her sandals behind and wandered over to the poolside, barefoot. Ami sighed, sitting down by the water as her feet swayed, distant memories flickering into her mind. She just felt restless, and knew of only one way to clear her worries.<br>
<br>
Of course, other things had to be cleared away first. Ami paid little mind to what came next; her fingers tracing down the center line of her buttoned top, undoing one then another. The pajama top was undone, then removed, left discarded behind her on the cool tile. She then lifted her legs up to remove her pants, and toss them back as well. Any reasonable girl would have stopped there; even swimming in her underwear would have been a daring notion at best. Yet Ami couldn't... she didn't like having the slightest hindrance. Without but a moment's restraint, she reached behind her, undid her bra, and tossed it off. Lastly, her panties were tugged down and away from her legs, and away they went too.<br>
<br>
Then and only then did the naked girl dive into the water, swimming lap after lap. Some minutes, possibly many, passed before Ami finally stopped, gasping for breath at poolside before hoisting herself up onto the tiled ledge.<br>
<br>
"...ah." Ami yawned. She felt better. She rubbed at her eyes, finally feeling some drowsiness come back to her. The reclined lawn chairs were looking very appealing. A short nap wouldn't do any harm... it couldn't have even been 4 yet. She let the damp water drip along the floor as she left the pool and headed to the chairs lining the wall... and without a second thought, she hit the vinyl surface and blacked out.<br>
"Mm..." She tossed and turned, finally rolling onto her back before blinking her eyes open. Ami felt a lot better... and she had long since dried off. She stretched her arms and legs up and out, before drawing them closer and rubbing her limbs lightly along each other. She felt good. Her limbs were tense, but content. Her skin felt soft, the sun warm, her body free-<br>
<br>
Wait...the sun? Ami blinked again, and craned her head up towards the skylight. Sure enough, warm rays of sunlight glistened along her body from the ceiling. It was bright and sunny... and she stared down in horror at her blatant lack of clothing. "O, oh no..." What time was it!? Ami looked around in a panic, searching around the pool in fright. Then her eyes shot to the clock on the wall. 8:55... AM. "No way...!"<br>
<br>
She recoiled in fright, her eyes searching the poolside. Her pajamas! Her clothing! Ami clamored to her feet and stumbled over to the water to recover her discarded sleepwear... just in time to see a janitor leaving through the doors with a pile of clothing on top of a basket, appearing bewildered.<br>
<br>
"It c-can't be..." Ami spun around, staring at the reflective surface of the pool, and the empty environment. She was stuck there, without anything to wear. All her clothes had been taken... and she didn't keep a change of clothes there. Her uniform was at home! Ami tried to keep her panic at bay, hugging her chest to settle her frantic breathing. "O, okay girl, you can... you can just explain to someone that-"<br>
<br>
Ding ding, ding ding... ding ding, ding... ding. Ami spun around to see the morning bell, 9:00 AM.<br>
<br>
The doors parted as a group of girls entered, giggling and smiling as they approached the poolside with satchels of swimwear... and in unison, their eyes swung to the naked swimmer.<br>
<br>
"Wow..." "Who's she?" "I don't recognize her..."<br>
Ami turned bright red, and clamored to clear things up. Why didn't they recognize her!?<br>
<br>
"I, I'm Ami, Ami Mizu-..." Then she saw their uniforms... sea green. They were also clearly years older than her, which only meant one thing.<br>
<br>
This wasn't Juuban. She was at the only other pool in the district; the one frequented by Michiru Kaiou's elite school.<br>
<br>
"Y, you're not from our school...!" "Pervert...!"<br>
The girls began to scream.<br>
<br>
Ami tried to turn and run, but one of the girls pulled the naked girl by the wrist. "Uh-uh! We don't allow that kind of defiancy here...!" "No way!"<br>
<br>
There was an array of intent nods and voices of consent, then before Ami could object, she felt her world go dark.<br>
<br>
"...mm..." She awoke slowly, staring up at an unfamiliar ceiling. Her hands were bound beside her, wrists at opposite lockers... and her ankles were secured in a similar manner. She was in the school hall... and the clock on the wall clearly displayed 9:50AM.<br>
<br>
And Ami was still naked. "N.no....!" Diiiiing. Classes got out moments later.<br>
<br>
Ami was never seen within miles of that academy ever again, though they most certainly wouldn't forget her.

<p lang="en-US"> <strong style="font-size:2em; text-transform: uppercase; font-weight:bold;">Remixed!!</strong><br><br><br>
”Shouldn't we wake her?”<br>
<br>
It was an obvious question to ask, given that the girl in question was completely naked. Lying on a lawn chair at the school's public pool, slim and long-legged, stretched out in all her glory before the imposing main building of Michiru Kaiou in the dead of night. She was, in fact, quite glorious. She was dark-haired, built like a ballerina, small feet, thin calves, and thighs that curved together just so. Where they met, a small patch of bluish-black hair caught and reflected the moonlight, which seemed to highlight the contrasts and make her skin like ivory, her hair like coal. Only her nipples and her lips broke this monotony of black and white, as if the night's pale glow cast the rest of her figure in monochrome.<br>
<br>
Yoko put her hands to her hips, considering the situation.<br>
<br>
”She might get a bit of a shock, being woken up by two perfect strangers. You don't recognize her either?”<br>
<br>
Kiriko shook her head. This only made the present situation all the more puzzling. They had figured out that she'd been skinny-dipping, but they couldn't find her clothes anywhere, and their hushed conversation had done nothing to stir the nude stranger from her slumber. Nor had their eyes, wandering over the sleeping woman with a mixture of jealousy and something else that neither girl dared to name to the other. It was very tempting to reach out and touch her, feel what her skin might be like, but that would in all likelihood entail waking her up.<br>
<br>
”The responsible thing,” Yoko concluded, ”would be to get her something to wear. Her own clothes have clearly gone missing. Kiriko, you do it.”<br>
<br>
”Do what?”<br>
<br>
”Give her something to wear! Before we wake her up.”<br>
<br>
”Well, what about the plan?”<br>
<br>
”We'll have time, won't we? All we have to do is-”<br>
<br>
The stranger stirred. With a low moan, she rolled over faintly on her side, let a hand fall over her body so that it landed near the bottom of her stomach. Faintly the fingers lingered there, traced little shapes beneath her belly-button, and both Kiriko and Yoko blushed and turned away. The girl had opened her legs, and her adventurous fingers were quickly blazing a path to these unexplored territories.<br>
<br>
”Is she-?”<br>
<br>
”I don't- I don't think so,” Kiriko replied, biting her lips. ”She's probably just... covering up.”<br>
<br>
”With her hands.”<br>
<br>
”Right.”<br>
<br>
The two girls fell silent, the awkward pause only punctuated by low, whining breaths behind them, sounding suspiciously rhythmical.<br>
<br>
”So. The gym lockers.”<br>
<br>
”Right. The plan. Sabotage Fumiko's swimsuit, handcuff her, get payback.”<br>
<br>
”Right. Let's go.”<br>
<br>
Neither girl moved.<br>
<br>
”Or we could steal Fumiko's swimsuit, and give it to this girl instead.”<br>
<br>
”We could. That'd be the good thing to do.”<br>
<br>
”We'd be like Goemon. Steal from the rich, give to the poor. Although then of course Fumiko's swimsuit won't fall off in public while she's handcuffed to a wall, so the whole payback angle we were going for won't really be there.”<br>
<br>
”Kiriko, which is more important? Our quest for payback, or saving some random stranger we've never met, and who in all likelihood got into this situation entirely by her own volition anyway?”<br>
<br>
”You're right, Yoko. We have to help her!”<br>
<br>
”Right. Let's go!”<br>
<br>
Neither girl moved.<br>
<br>
”Hey Yoko?”<br>
<br>
”Yeah?”<br>
<br>
”What if she wakes up while we're gone, and can't find her clothes, and runs away somewhere before we're back?”<br>
<br>
”That'd be bad. Then we wouldn't be helping her or getting payback. Hey, Kiriko... What if you steal Fumiko's swimsuit, and wear it instead? Then in the event that she wakes up before we get back, she can just wear your pajamas.”<br>
<br>
”But I'm only wearing panties underneath!”<br>
<br>
”She's wearing even less.”<br>
<br>
Kiriko considered. It was a difficult decision, but then, the gym lockers weren't too far, and they were trespassing anyway, and nobody was around besides Yoko. She imagined how horrified the poor girl would be to wake up without a stitch of clothing, surrounded by complete strangers. No, she would have to do the right thing!<br>
<br>
Kiriko unbuttoned her pajama top and took it off, neatly folding it up by the foot of the lawn chair, trying not to look at the girl who was still – quite vigorously – covering up in her sleep. Then she slipped out of her bottoms and stood on the school grounds in nothing but her little pink panties, her arms folded over her gently sloping breasts. A shiver ran through her, the night air cool against her bare form.<br>
<br>
”Okay. Let's go!”<br>
<br>
Finally, both girls moved out, Yoko in her pajamas, Kiriko covered by nothing but her diminutive panties and her folded arms, hugging her chest. She stole one last glance at the sleeping beauty, and then rounded the corner to where the doors were.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Kiriko chanced a glance at the clock in the locker room – they had already wasted quite a bit of time, halted by the unexpected intruder. It would soon be dawn, and class started just an hour after that, with swimming first on the schedule. Fortunately, they had come prepared.<br>
<br>
”You have her locker combination?”<br>
<br>
Kiriko nodded. ”1326”<br>
<br>
Yoko nodded in satisfaction, popping open her own locker to ready the equipment they'd prepared for the payback. In accordance with the plan, she produced a pair of scissors, a pair of handcuffs, a long rubber tube, a detailed sketch of the school building, two rubber ducks, a model airplane, an airhorn, and a lemon. It was quite a masterful plan, and she was sure it would've gone off without a hitch if not for the sudden intervention. Maybe some part of it could still be salvaged.<br>
<br>
Kiriko, meanwhile, popped open Fumiko's locker. Here, another hitch in the plan unfortunately introduced itself, which caused the poor panty-clad girl no small amount of distress.<br>
<br>
”Yoko?”<br>
<br>
”Yes?”<br>
<br>
”The swimsuit isn't here.”<br>
<br>
”What?”<br>
<br>
”Fumiko's locker is empty.”<br>
<br>
”Impossible! I saw her wear it just yesterday. Look closer.”<br>
<br>
Yoko looked at the full-sized locker, with no success. Maybe the swimsuit was on the rack up top? She leaned inside, forced now to move her hands from her breasts to fumble in the dark. Yoko, meanwhile, put the scissors and handcuffs in her waistband – there might still be a way to get use out of them.<br>
<br>
”It's not here, Yoko, she must have-”<br>
<br>
The door abruptly opened. Muffling a shriek, Yoko shoved the near-naked Kiriko into the locker, slamming it shut to hide her. It'd be too embarrassing to be caught in just panties!<br>
<br>
”I'm just here to look for my bus pass!” Yoko said, blurting out her prepared excuse. She breathed a sigh of relief – of all the people who could have found her, it was the aging janitor. He peered into the room through his thick-rimmed glasses, mumbling some apology. The man was nearly blind; even if Kiriko hadn't hidden inside the locker, it was unlikely he'd notice a thing about her state of dress. Mumbling some apology, he closed the door and moved on.<br>
<br>
”Sorry!” Yoko breathed after he was gone. ”Did I hurt you?”<br>
<br>
”I'm okay.” Kiriko said. ”But um... I think I... snagged on something.”<br>
<br>
”You did?”<br>
<br>
”My- um, my underpants. They're stuck in something.”<br>
<br>
Yoko turned at the locker's handle. It was, regrettably, quite stuck, refusing to open. Kiriko, meanwhile, yelped a little at the sensation of something tugging on her panties.<br>
<br>
”I think they're stuck pretty firmly.” Kiriko said. ”It's like they're hung up on the lock, I don't-”<br>
<br>
”Hung up!” Yoko struck her forehead. ”Fumiko must have hung her bikini in the showers after she dressed, and forgot to lock it up! Can you try to untangle yourself? I'll be right back.”<br>
<br>
”I'll- I'll try.”<br>
<br>
Yoko hurried into the shower stalls, opening them one by one. Empty. Empty. Empty. Then, finally, the prize – a red bikini, folded neatly on the little shelf for shampoo and soap. Yoko stepped confidently inside, ready to retrieve it and assist the now two undressed girls on the premises, when she discovered – to her great surprise – that Fumiko had forgotten more than her bikini in the stall. Yoko's foot made contact with a bar of soap, and she went heels over head backwards, landing on her rump.<br>
<br>
”Ow!”<br>
<br>
”Are you okay?” came Kiriko's muffled cry from inside the locker.<br>
<br>
”I'm fine. I had scissors on me, but they didn't poke me or anything, they just... Oh.”<br>
<br>
Yoko climbed to her feet, her pajama pants pooled around them. Evidently the scissors hadn't been entirely harmless, at least not as far as her waistband was concerned. She didn't understand how it had happened – somehow she must have absent-mindedly put them down open, with one shear inside and one shear out. This was unfortunate in itself, but even more unfortunate was that Yoko, unlike Kiriko, had the habit of sleeping commando.<br>
<br>
Well, she might not have any panties, but she had Fumiko's bikini bottoms well within reach. All she had to do was pick them up and-<br>
<br>
-somehow the handcuffs had snapped shut around Yoko's wrist when she caught herself landing. They dangled from her right hand perilously, the other cuff open and free. This momentarily perplexed her, and, amazed at how she could have by coincidence both cut her pants open and got herself stuck in the handcuffs, she took a brief step backwards.<br>
<br>
”Hey Kiriko, I'm okay but-”<br>
<br>
Yoko slipped on the soap again. Her hands went up to catch herself, and they expertly did, the cuffs swinging just over the showerhead before coming around to her left wrist and clicking in place. She held her balance, kicking away the bar of soap with a grunt. Yoko looked up.<br>
<br>
”Kiriko, I've a bit of a problem here-”<br>
<br>
”Problem?” Kiriko shouted. ”We don't have time for problems! Hurry up and release me!”<br>
<br>
Yoko was a tall girl, and getting the cuffs over the showerhead wouldn't be a problem ordinarily, save that the pipe was bolted securely to the ceiling. There was no way of slipping the cuffs past them. She testingly pulled rattled one way, then the other, and then finally braced a knee against the shower and pulled.<br>
<br>
It had no effect on the shower's structural integrity. Her knee, however, found the knob for turning it on. In an instant she was soaked, blinded by a rush of cold water, unable to either see or get out of the way. The water dissolved the forgotten soap, turning the floor far too slippery, and her fumbling against either the shower or the knob did her absolutely nothing. She was trapped where she was, her ass bare, wet, and facing the open stall door. All she wore was a soaked pajama top, clinging to her skin and becoming increasingly transparent. Try as she might, she couldn't turn the shower back off.<br>
<br>
Maybe they should have just stuck with the plan.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Ami came to her senses, blinking against the dawning sky. She'd had such a wonderful dream, wonderful but naughty – that she had gone skinny dipping in public, and lost all her clothes, and-<br>
<br>
-and-<br>
<br>
Ami blinked against the dawning sky. Dawning? Dawning? She was trapped at school without a stitch of clothing! Ami flew to her feet just in time to see a retreating elderly janitor, carrying a sopping-wet pajamas in the distance. It had gone into the water! Panic set in as she glanced around, hoping against hope to spot someone she knew, someone she could ask for help, but she was alone... and the big clock showed school was about to begin.<br>
<br>
Wait... that wasn't a familiar clock. This wasn't even Juuban! How in the world had her sleepwalking taken her all the way out here?<br>
<br>
Panicking, Ami covered up with her hands, ready to be exposed by a whole bunch of strangers... and then discovered, to her great astonishment, a pajamas by the side of her lawn chair. It wasn't hers; it was bright red flannel, embroidered with the monogram of some wealthy family. Probably a student of Michiru Kaiou. Ami felt bad taking it, but she wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth.<br>
<br>
She slipped it on not a moment too soon. Not long thereafter, the girls of the boarding school made their way towards the gym lockers, row after row of girls in sea-green uniforms. It was embarrassing being caught in pajamas, but it was much better than the alternative. Ami hurried past them, heading for the exit, drawing a few quizzical glances from the girls in green. Then they started laughing, a biting, mocking laugh that made her blush all over. She slipped away, and the laughing girls headed for the locker rooms, filing inside.<br>
<br>
Imagine being caught helpless and undressed by the likes of them! Ami could only imagine what an awful fate she had escaped, and all thanks to the kindness of a stranger. </p>
