    </h1>
</div>
<p>
It was a dark and stormy night. Thunder rolled on the horizon and the wind was howling in the trees, but strangely, it wasn't raining – at least, not noticeably. Sprays and droplets of water flew through the air, but they didn't come from the sky; they came from the little lake, torn from its surface by the whipping wind. Indeed, it seemed like all the world was under the storms' thumb tonight; even the distant mountains looked small and humble compared to the black clouds that loomed in the sky. Only the castle seemed untouched by the furious weather, towering over the forest as it always did. It was tall and dark like a handsome stranger, quiet and regal like a somber priest. Except... it wasn't entirely quiet.<br>
<br>
Even over the wind, one could hear sounds of merriment drifting out from within, and there was light streaming out from behind its window shutters. The storm could not touch the castle; its icy hand did not penetrate the sturdy walls, its booming voice never reached the ears of those inside. In part, this was because the castle was well built, with black walls and heavy towers – but in part, it was because the castle belonged to a sorceress, and even the mighty storm must bow to her powers.<br>
<br>
So it was, that even in this savage storm, men and women of noble birth were in the castle, making merry. The sorceress was having a ball, and everyone with a good name must attend – such was law in her land. Everyone was warm and comfortable behind the castle walls – everyone, of course, except the poor gate guards.<br>
<br>
"Curse this weather!" said the first guard. "Curse this weather, and curse our evil mistress, who-"<br>
"Ssh!" hissed the other. "She might hear you, and then we are done for!"<br>
"Over the sound of the storm, through the walls? Gods, man, she isn't all-powerful."<br>
"Still. I don't like to hear you speak ill of her. What if someone else is listening?"<br>
"Who would that be? We are alone out here. I shall speak as loud and as ill of her as I will, and-"<br>
<br>
There was a sudden thump, and the first guard abruptly fell over without another sound. The second jumped in fear, and was so surprised he dropped his halberd. Before he had time to pick it up, he saw the glint of metal, and froze. Before him stood a woman: Short, with red hair in a firm ponytail and clothed in black leather. She was small, lithe, and did not look terribly powerful: Had she not been armed, he could have wrestled her down easily. She was, though: She held a wicked dagger, and it was pointed straight at this throat. Her face was a little boyish, albeit beautiful, with a strong jawline and thin lips. Her eyes were a brilliant blue, and they were staring at him forcefully.<br>
<br>
"I just knocked your friend out." she said, and her voice was clear and beautiful, with a sing-song accent from some foreign land. "He'll be all right. I won't kill you either, if you don't do anything stupid." The guard nodded silently. "Good. Now give me your keys."<br>
<br>
The guard obliged, taking the keys from his belt and handing them over. "Thank you." smiled the girl. "So, whose castle is this?"<br>
<br>
"I- it belongs to the sorceress Safira", said the guard incredulously, "Have you not heard of her?"<br>
<br>
"So I have. Her wealth is as legendary as her arrogance. I am here to liberate her of some of the former. ...and maybe the latter, if I find an opportunity to."<br>
<br>
"I – I recognize you!" the guard blurted out, "You are Frieda of the Far North! You- you are wanted for a dozen thefts!"<br>
<br>
"You have a good memory. Drink this." She took a step back and tossed a small bottle to him. "Don't worry, it isn't poisonous."<br>
<br>
The guard hesitated, but then did as he was told – in one gulp, he downed the contents of the bottle. He dropped it, and a confused look came over his face as he sank to the ground. Within moments he was fast asleep, lying next to his fallen companion.<br>
<br>
Frieda stepped over the fallen guards, approaching a small side-door next to the gate, twirling the key-ring about her finger. There were only five keys on it, but none of them fit – evidently, Safira was cunning enough to only give them keys to the inside doors. She shrugged – there were other ways in. She paced back and forth outside the castle, undisturbed by the sleeping guards, as she inspected the sheer black walls. Eventually, her eyes were drawn to a large window some six yards directly above the sleeping guards. She flexed her fingers, and begun to climb.<br>
<br>
It was difficult with the wind whipping at her, and once or twice she thought she would come crashing down on the unconscious men – but her expert fingers managed to find faults in the thick walls, and she  climbed patiently, knowing she had all night. After a little while, she reached the windowsill, and listened at the window shutters; all was quiet inside. She drew a knife and unhooked the latch of the windows, pulling them open.<br>
<br>
The room she entered was quite dark, and seemed to be some kind of servants' quarters full of humble beds with footside chests. It was unoccupied, and she could guess that every servant was busy attending the party. Carefully, she sneaked along the room, heading for a door to the left – but, hearing women's voices behind it, decided to try the right instead. The right door led to a long corridor, rather well-lit and with a marble statue at the end, depicting a nude woman holding a cup, as if proposing a toast. Seeing nobody about, she decided to make her way towards the statue, for next to it she could see staircases leading both up and down.<br>
<br>
Slipping out through the door, she rather carelessly walked down the hallway, as her sharp ears did not register anyone present. It was only when she had gone almost halfway that she suddenly froze, aware that someone was watching her. She cast a glance about her shoulder, but there was nobody behind; nor did it seem like anyone was peering through the doors to the sides. What was wrong?<br>
<br>
Then she caught it. The eyes of the statue had moved. Magical defenses, she had heard – was this statue such a device? She hastily withdrew, returning to the servants' room, but she was sure of it: The statue had seen her. Well, as far as she could tell it had raised no alarm; she would simply have to find another way down. Or... perhaps the statue would not recognize her, if she was dressed like a servant? She had heard that magical creatures were often rather simple-minded; perhaps it would work.<br>
<br>
She tried one of the small chests, but to her disappointment, it did not contain clothes, merely personal effects – a mirror, some candles, a book. It seemed clothes were stored somewhere else. Suddenly, she heard someone at the door – instinctively, she ducked in behind a bed, as two women entered from where she had heard conversation before. They were dressed in quite simple sleeveless white dresses, with sandals on their otherwise naked feet.<br>
<br>
"Poor Valora," said one of them, "The mistress will not be happy with her tardiness."<br>
"Poor? It is her own fault. She should have made sure to take her bath earlier. She needs it, too – imagine her turning up at the ball with such a smudge on her face! That girl is always getting in trouble."<br>
"It's not only her fault. Lots of people play pranks on her. She wouldn't have gotten that smudge if Shaila hadn't tripped her."<br>
"Well, still..."<br>
<br>
The two women exited into the hallway with the statue, and Frieda listened to their footsteps as they made their way down the stairs. She glanced towards the door from which they had left – so there was Valora, taking a bath. She considered: It was worth a shot. She slipped out from her hiding place, listening intently. Soon enough, she could hear splashing.<br>
<br>
Soundlessly, she inched her way over to the door and looked inside. It was a servants' bathroom: A wooden tub stood on the floor, a white dress folded neatly over a nearby chair. In the tub was a girl, about Frieda's age – and size! She was brown-haired and looked quite dirty, and was busy scrubbing her back with a large brush. There was no time to hesitate. Soundlessly, the thief stole into the room, snatching the dress from the chair; the girl didn't notice a thing. Surprisingly, there were no other garments there, only a pair of sandals: Frieda picked them up with a pair of hooked fingers and withdrew from the room, just before the girl turned around to reach for the soap.<br>
<br>
There was a small side-room to the servants' dormitories, where she chose to hide: Frieda guessed it must belong to some head maid, as it held a larger chest, a tall mirror, and a slightly nicer bed. Hearing Valora still splashing in her bathtub, she inspected the white dress: It was short-sleeved and only knee-length, and would make a poor disguise if she kept her armor on underneath it. Cursing silently, she realized she would have to leave it behind.<br>
<br>
She slipped out of her trousers, boots and jacket, hiding them under the head maids' bed, and she was also forced to relinquish her undershirt, leaving her dressed in a black bra and shorts. She hurriedly pulled on the dress; it fit surprisingly well, and was loose enough not to be terribly revealing. She took the knife and its scabbard from her belt, and managed to hide it by tying it to her shoulder, behind her back – the mirror confirmed, that it was almost impossible to see while she held a straight posture. Putting on the sandals, she was ready.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it seemed, so was Valora. The splashing in the bathroom had ended, and now Frieda could hear motion outside.<br>
<br>
"Girls? Shaila? This isn't funny..." came a quivering voice. "I need my dress! I have to get to work!"<br>
<br>
Hearing the girl approach the head maids' door, Frieda quickly hid herself behind it as it opened. Valora entered; she was built much like Frieda, but with pitch-black hair, now glistening wet from her bath. She held a small towel to cover herself, but her backside was bare and Frieda could see her little buttocks quite clearly from her hiding place. The girl was quivering, though whether it was from cold or something else, Frieda could not tell.<br>
<br>
"Is there anybody here? Hello? What... what's this?"<br>
<br>
Frieda froze. Some of her jacket was still sticking out from under the bed, and it seemed Valora had spotted it. Thinking quickly, she took a step forth and cleared her throat.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing in the head maids' room, girl?"<br>
<br>
The other nearly fell over from shock; her hand shot out to the bed, and the towel fell from her body. She hunched over, covering herself with her hands, as she spun around to face the thief. Her visage was cute and childlike, with long eyelashes and a button nose; she blushed crimson as her gaze met Frieda's.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry!" she spat out, "Someone has taken my- who are you?"<br>
"My name is... Rubena. I was sent to look for you."<br>
"I know I'm late, but my-"<br>
"Your what?" Frieda interrupted, doing her best to keep the girl on her toes.<br>
"My dress was stolen!" cried the girl, "I was taking a bath, and then... it was just gone!"<br>
"Well, go get another one!"<br>
<br>
The girl hesitated, looking away from Frieda's confident gaze – and mentally, the thief sighed in relief. The bluff had worked.<br>
<br>
"But... there aren't any here! Everyone's wearing theirs, I- um, could you fetch one for me? The laundry room isn't far, but it's-"<br>
"I'm just as busy as you are!" interrupted Frieda, "Go get it yourself. Come on, hurry!"<br>
<br>
Valora bit her lip, and reached down to pick up her towel. As she did, Frieda could catch just the briefest glimpse of her nipples, red like cherries and surprisingly small. "But-" protested the girl, "I'm naked-"<br>
<br>
"You'll stay naked unless you get something to wear." Frieda interjected, "So hurry up and leave!"<br>
<br>
"...I don't dare to."<br>
<br>
Frieda put her hands on her hips and rolled her eyes, quite dramatically – it was a nice touch, she thought to herself. "What's there to be afraid of?" she asked impatiently. "Go on, tell me."<br>
<br>
"I- I don't want anyone to see me this way..." protested Valora weakly, pressing the little towel against her body. It was clear that, even with only one other person present, she was quite embarrassed of her predicament.<br>
<br>
"What choice do you have?" retorted the thief, hands still on her hips. "Either you go get another dress, or you stay in here until someone comes to find you. Someone who might not be as understanding as me."<br>
<br>
"But-"<br>
<br>
"Oh for heaven's sake!" Frieda took a step forwards and reached deftly for the towel. With a quick snap she snatched it away from the poor girl, leaving her stark naked. The other gave a short yelp and covered herself with her hands, hunching over even further. "You have this, don't you?" she said, hefting the little towel.<br>
<br>
"Please give it back..." protested Valora weakly.<br>
<br>
"Why? It's not like you were going to go anywhere when you had it, right? If you're just going to stay here, I might as well keep it."<br>
<br>
Valora was on the verge of panic now, and Frieda could see it. She looked around from side to side, bit her lip, and seemed to consider her options. Finally, quivering – either from the cold or from shame – she mumbled something quietly.<br>
"What's that?"<br>
<br>
"I'll go."<br>
<br>
"Good", smiled Frieda, and turned around to leave. "Come on, then."<br>
<br>
"But- my towel? Don't I get it back?"<br>
<br>
Frieda sighed. This was a lot of trouble just to keep a girl from finding her stuff. "Here you go." she said, and tossed the towel over her shoulder casually. She didn't exactly intend for what happened next, but she didn't mind: Valora made a little noise as the towel sailed above her, missing her outstretched arm, and landing on the tall full-body mirror – just out of reach. Frieda turned around, and saw the comical look on the servant-girls' face as she stared at her blushing reflection and the towel suspended above it. She smirked, and leaned against the door-frame: The situation really was rather entertaining.<br>
<br>
Hesitantly, Valora cast a glance towards the other girl, but they were equally short – neither could reach the towel very easily. "Could- could you help me?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Oh, sure! I think if you stand on the bed, you should be able to reach it if you just lean far enough."<br>
<br>
Valora looked towards the towel, then at the bed, and then at her reflection. Keeping one hand covering her crotch, she climbed up on the head maids' bed – true enough, if she leaned, she might reach it. She couldn't avoid seeing herself in the mirror, though: Naked, still wet from the bath, and blushing like a tomato. She leaned carefully, reaching out with her free arm – and Frieda's eyes were once more drawn to her little breasts, and the red rosebuds that crowned them. Valora could see them in the mirror, but she seemed to try to ignore it as she reached for the towel. Two inches left... now only one inch... she was almost there, but not quite. She stretched out her leg behind her for counterbalance, and was able to manage another half an inch. Her eyes shot towards 'Rubena', and then towards her naked reflection. It wasn't enough.<br>
<br>
Slowly, hesitantly, she lifted her other hand. She needed to stretch both arms out to keep her balance. Frieda watched with interest as a little black triangle came into view, and Valora saw herself reflected in the mirror, in all her naked glory. She blushed, and wanted to close her eyes, but she was afraid she would lose her balance. She kept her gaze steadily on the towel, trying not to think about how exposed she was, stretched out like a naked ballerina. Half an inch... one-quarter... she had it!<br>
<br>
Hurriedly she skipped down from the bed and covered herself up with the towel once more. Her eyes avoided Frieda's, she just looked at the ground. "C- Can I go now?" she asked, and Frieda nodded, amused at the little show the girl had put on. "Go ahead. Hurry!"<br>
<br>
She watched as Valora hurried out of the room, the towel still pressed against her, and disappeared down the hallway. "Well." she said to herself. "That was fun, but I'd better get going."<br>
<br>
She turned her attention to the bed, and made sure to cover up her mistake, hiding her clothes and things properly under the bed. Then she took a few deep breaths, and stepped out into the dormitories, striding confidently towards the hallway. Frieda knew that there was more to disguises than just clothing, and she mentally thanked the hapless girl for forcing her to try out her acting skills: She would have to play the role of Rubena from here on.<br>
<br>
For the magical statue, though, the clothes seemed to be enough. It remained lifeless as she sauntered down the hallway in the white dress and the sandals, and she reached the staircase without any trouble. She paused, considering which way to go: Upwards, towards the tower, or downwards, into the castle itself. Eventually she decided on the former, on the basis that the goods up there might be less well guarded.<br>
<br>
She was three steps up the stairs, when there was a sudden voice behind her, and she froze.<br>
<br>
Turn around and stay a spell,<br>
For I have some advice to tell.<br>
<br>
She slowly turned – where had the voice come from? The hallway was still empty, but she could guess at it. Slowly, she descended the three stair-steps again and turned to the marble woman, who seemed as unmoving as ever. "Um, what would that be?"<br>
<br>
The eyes of the marble statue were once more upon her, and she felt it scrutinize her carefully. It didn't answer, though, and they just stood there a while facing each other, before Frieda made a move to leave. Abruptly, the statue's lips moved, and it spoke again, in a deep alto voice:<br>
<br>
To heed the mistress' will we must,<br>
And in my gaze, she placed her trust:<br>
I spy something that does not fit,<br>
I see something she won't permit.<br>
Young servant girl, you are aware<br>
Beneath that robe, you must be bare!<br>
<br>
Frieda blinked, confused for a second – then she remembered: Valora seemingly didn't own any underwear, but under the disguise, she was still wearing her shorts! The statue must have seen a glimpse of them as she was heading up the stairs, and she mentally kicked herself for not having covered it up better. She knew the statue could see – why hadn't she thought of this?<br>
<br>
"Well, uh," she said awkwardly, "Of course I know that. I'll just take them off."<br>
<br>
She turned away from the statue and lifted the front of the dress, undoing the strings of the shorts. Hastily she pulled them down, and stepped out of them. "There. All done. I'm sorry." she said with an apologetic smile as she picked them up. "I'll just, um, go on upstairs then?"<br>
<br>
Again the statue was silent for a while, and Frieda just stood there, holding her shorts, uncertain of what to do with them. But then, the rich alto voice came once more from the nude woman's lips:<br>
<br>
Young girl, you know, that will not do:<br>
My eyes will see, or it's not true.<br>
The mistress made my eyes to see,<br>
Reveal your secrets now to me.<br>
<br>
"I don't want to trouble you, miss... uh, statue, but I really ought to be on my way. I'm running late, and-"<br>
<br>
The statue's expression abruptly changed – now it looked threatening, and the voice that emerged was much less pleasant:<br>
<br>
To run away, I say thee nay!<br>
It will not do to disobey!<br>
If you would break her strict command,<br>
I'll stop your stride with my own hand!<br>
<br>
As the statue said this, the hand that wasn't grasping the goblet tightened into a fist, and Frieda swallowed, taking a half-step backwards. "A- All right! I've got a bra on as well. I'll remove it, all right?"<br>
<br>
The statue did not respond, so Frieda hitched up the dress behind her and reached for the bra. It took her some time to undo it, but she finally managed – all the while the statue remained unmoving, staring harshly at her. She finally pulled the bra out through one of her sleeves. "There. That's all I got. Honest." she said, dropping the bra before the statue almost as if it were an offering.<br>
<br>
The statue didn't speak, this time – instead it just moved. Before Frieda could even react, a large marble hand clasped around her wrist. She tried to push it away, but the statue was freakishly strong, and she was lifted into the air, hanging from one arm in the statue's grasp. She kicked in panic at the statues' free hand, which was headed for her legs – but it didn't even seem to notice. Instead it reached for the hem of her dress and hitched it up so high that it was pulled over her head, exposing her little breasts and her plain brown panties. She hung helplessly before the marble woman as it spoke again.<br>
<br>
Young girl, you lie, you had your chance,<br>
But you are wearing underpants!<br>
<br>
Frieda felt a sharp tug on her panties, and they were torn down to around her ankles. They dangled off her foot for a moment, before they finally fell to the ground. She hung naked and helpless before the marble statue for what seemed like an eternity, and with the dress over her face, she couldn't see what was happening. She felt the cold air of the castle against her naked buttocks, and she shivered. There was a sharp tug on her shoulders: The knot that held her knife-scabbard came loose, and it was torn away. Then, after another long wait, the statue just set her down gently on the ground.<br>
<br>
A naked little girl I see,<br>
with nothing on that should not be.<br>
The mistress' law has been obeyed,<br>
and so, my marble hand is stayed.<br>
<br>
Frieda immediately collapsed, her legs weak from the shock, and just sat there on her knees. She pulled the dress down to cover herself, but it didn't help against the uncomfortable chill in her nether regions – she was definitely not used to wearing skirts with no underwear. The statue had returned to its original position – looking happy as ever, with a goblet raised to make a toast. Somehow, the clothes she had taken off were simply gone – she couldn't see them anywhere.<br>
<br>
Frieda swallowed. "Well, that was unpleasant." she said to herself. Then she heard steps from downstairs – obviously, someone must have heard the statue bellowing. "Oh, to the devil with it! Pick yourself up, Frieda, get moving."<br>
<br>
She forced herself up on her feet, and hurried up the stairs – self-conscious of the fact that anyone walking behind her might get a glimpse of one thing or another, but she didn't have time to stop and consider. Instead, she just made her way up to a higher landing, pausing to rest at an alcove, trying to compose herself.<br>
<br>
"It was just a statue. It'll be all right. I still have all my stuff under the head maids' bed. I-"<br>
<br>
Her monologue was suddenly interrupted as she saw something in the alcove: A shining silver candelabra. Suddenly, her worries were gone, as she remembered the potential reward for breaking into Safira's castle: Such a candelabra was a mere trifle compared to all the wondrous riches held here. Standing up straight, she gathered her confidence. "No point in dwelling on the past." she told herself, "I came here for a reason, after all. Onwards and upwards!"<br>
<br>
She hurried her pace up the winding staircase with its red carpet, and passed by beautiful stained-glass windows with more silver candelabras set before them – but these too, she ignored, knowing that Safira possessed far greater treasures. No, her goals were set for something truly valuable, and she would take her time – searching each landing carefully, until a majestic mahogany door finally revealed something worthy of her attention. As she carefully nudged it open, a beautiful boudoir appeared before her eyes, with teak furniture and silver mirrors: Vials of finest crystal were set upon the bedside desk, and glittering jewelry rested upon a set of drawers. It was not fine enough to be the sorceresses' own, so the room must be for some noble guest or other.<br>
<br>
"Beggars can't be choosers", Frieda thought, as she stole into the room with a great smile upon her face, letting her fingers play over the beautiful tiara that lay there, adorned with diamonds and sapphires, wrought from finest electrum. She picked it up, inspected it, and let her expert eyes fall upon the assortment of rings, brooches, and necklaces that were beside it. Each thing was more beautiful than the next – precious stones glittered, encased in gold and silver and platinum of finest quality. These things in themselves were worth a fortune; she was lucky to have found them with such ease. All she had to do now, she thought, was find some way to hide them, while-<br>
<br>
A door into the boudoir abruptly opened. She barely had time to set the tiara down and turn around, ready to run for her life, when a lady entered. To her surprise, Frieda found herself even more bedazzled than she had been with the gold and jewels.<br>
<br>
It was a tall woman of awesome beauty, blond locks elegantly framing her graceful features: Her eyes were a warm blue, and her lips and cheeks the color of young roses. She looked powerful and proud, carrying herself with the elegance of a dancer, but the most beautiful thing about her was her dress. It was a long, pink gown, strewn with golden embroidery and adorned with sparkling diamonds. The neckline was low, with white lace underneath, and there was white silk along the hem and sleeves, a flowing ribbon of the same material tied about her waist. Crowning this vision was a giant blue opal worn as a brooch, resting right between her shapely breasts.<br>
<br>
Before Frieda had time to react to the vision of loveliness before her, the lady smiled softly and spoke:<br>
<br>
"You must be my servant. Well. I am ready to go down to the ball; I shall just need my rings and tiara."<br>
<br>
With those words, she extended her hands towards the thief, who saw little option but to comply with the lady's wishes. The thought of running away, or attempting to resist, didn't even occur to Frieda, so smitten was she with the grace and beauty of this noblewoman – so she simply took the rings and slipped them onto those thin gloved fingers. It shocked her to hear the lady's elegant voice: "Thank you." she said courteously, much to Frieda's surprise. "And the tiara, please."<br>
<br>
Frieda turned around and retrieved the glittering crescent, and while she cursed quietly at having to let it go, she didn't dare object – besides, she reminded herself, she was here to rob Safira, not her guests. The lady was much taller than her, and she gracefully bowed down to let the would-be thief place the beautiful diadem upon her brow. As she did, Frieda could see straight down her cleavage, and the sight made her blush; she turned away from the lady as soon as she was done.<br>
<br>
"Thank you very much. Now, would you please accompany me to the ballroom?" asked the woman, with a smile. "I am Lady Rozabela, by the way. I do not think we have met; no matter, you seem quite competent."<br>
<br>
Frieda was about to respond with some excuse, when she halted herself – in the company of a lady, as her servant, would be the perfect opportunity to scout the place. Demurely, she smiled back at the Lady Rozabela.<br>
<br>
"Certainly."<br>

        <span class="new-text">Valora's Adventure</span>
    </h1>
</div>

<p>
This day was just getting worse and worse for Valora. First she had been appointed to service one of the guests – which was usually a terrible job – and then, because she was the new girl, Shaila and her little posse of girls had bullied her, tripping her while she was working in the kitchen. So she had gone up to the dormitories to take a bath, only nobody had been willing to help her carry water, so it had taken forever.<br>
<br>
Then, two girls had come in to scold her for running late. She thought they meant well at first, they'd given her lots of good advice – but then apparently, when she wasn't looking, they had sneaked back into the room, taken her dress and left. And then... then that horrible Rubena, and now this. She was sidling down a corridor, her back against the wall, with only a tiny towel to cover up. She held it firmly pressed against her chest with both hands as she glanced around nervously – probably nobody was up here, most people were already down in the ballroom or else working in the kitchens, but still.<br>
<br>
She picked up her pace a little, and passed by the big marble statue by the stairs. People kept saying it was magical, but she hadn't seen anything to that effect and suspected it was just a rumor that kept flying around. She peered down the stairs: It didn't look like anyone was down there, so she bit her lip, took a deep breath, and tip-toed down it as quickly as she could. The stairs were stone, and so cold to her naked feet; she wished those mean girls would at least have let her keep the sandals.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the bottom of the stairs, she hesitantly moved up to the heavy oak door that she knew led to the section of the castle where the laundry baskets came from. Unfortunately she wasn't exactly sure of where it was – she had never worked in laundry. She had little choice, though. She opened the door to a crack – there was a large, open room on the other side, some sort of lounge, with suits of armor lined up along the walls and large stone pillars.  She took a deep breath and sneaked into the room, glancing around carefully. It seemed to be all right. She hurried her pace, aiming for an archway across the room, when a sudden noise made her jump, and she leaped in behind one of the pillars, frantically trying to cover up as much as she could with the little towel.<br>
<br>
It was a guard patrol. They were coming from the very archway she had been headed for, and she was glad she had heard them in advance. The two men walked silently across the room. As quiet as a mouse, she shifted behind the pillar, moving just a little so that she would stay out of their sight. It worked. She breathed a sigh of relief as the two men disappeared beyond the oaken door, and the only sound she could hear was the loud thumping of her heart. It surprised her how excited she was.<br>
<br>
She shut her eyes, took a deep breath, and slipped around the pillar, heading for the corridor. It was pretty dark in there, and so cold that she involuntarily shivered, nearly losing her balance. The only light was behind her, and she could only see a vague outline of the corridor up ahead – but she guessed the laundry room was at the far end of it. She sped up her pace, tip-toeing quickly across the corridor, clutching her towel.<br>
<br>
She was about halfway when the door opened. She stopped in place, looking for someplace to hide or maybe even to just press herself up against the wall, but it was too late – she had already been spotted. "Hello?" came a woman's voice.<br>
<br>
"Um, hello..." Valora responded weakly, hugging her towel even tighter. No point in trying to hide now, she had already been seen.<br>
<br>
"Who's there?" came the voice again, and it sounded strangely unsurprised by her nudity.<br>
<br>
"I'm, um, Rubena!" lied Valora. If the other person didn't recognize her, it was just as well she didn't know her name, either. Imagine how they would talk about her if she was found out!<br>
<br>
"Oh. Well, Rubena, fetch us some fresh polishing rags from the laundry room, would you? We need the new trays to be sparkling before they're brought out to the ball room. Head maids' orders."<br>
<br>
"O- of course!" Valora responded quickly. "I'm new here though, which way's the laundry room?"<br>
<br>
"Back where you came from, then to the left. There won't be anyone there now, but polishing rags are in the cabinet just inside the door. Can't miss 'em."<br>
<br>
Valora was happy beyond herself. Not only was the laundry room within her reach, but whoever she was talking to was also kind enough not to tease her for her state of dress. "Right away!" she responded. "How many do you need?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, two or so ought to do."<br>
<br>
"I'm on my way!" she said cheerfully, and turned on her heel to leave. She only had time to take a few steps, however, before the voice called out again:<br>
<br>
"Hold on a second... are you naked?"<br>
<br>
Valora froze in the spot. Suddenly the realization dawned on her. In the darkness, the little towel had made it seemed as though she was actually clothed – perhaps in a slightly small dress, but still, clothed. There was nothing covering her back, though, and she had thoughtlessly turned around without moving the towel.<br>
<br>
"N- no?" she tried, and started to walk again.<br>
<br>
"Come back here!"<br>
<br>
She sped up her pace. Whoever was behind her started walking after her. "I said come back here!"<br>
<br>
Valora sped to a flat-out run. She held the towel before herself and ran in panic out of the corridor, hearing the clatter of sandals on stone behind her. She was back in the room with the armors, and she turned to the right – hoping she could make the run to the laundry room. Too late she realized her mistake, as she ran up to a locked door marked "Silverware". She turned on the spot, prepared to run across the room – but then, the woman who had pursued her burst out of the corridor, blocking her path.<br>
<br>
She was a sturdy woman, not much older than Valora and with the same raven-black hair. Her face was slightly pudgy with round cheeks and a broad nose, and her bare arms were covered in black smudges and stains from polishing. A broad smile split her face, revealing very white teeth.<br>
<br>
"You are naked! Unbelievable! How come you're not wearing your dress? Is this some kind of punishment?"<br>
<br>
"N- no, it's just, a couple of girls took my dress." Valora said with an apologetic smile, backing up against the silverware door and covering herself with the towel. "I- I was just heading for the laundry room to pick up another one."<br>
<br>
"Oh, wow, that's mean." said the sturdier girl, somewhat sympathetically. "Well, I'll go over to the laundry room and get one. You just stay right here."<br>
<br>
She turned around to leave, but then two other girls emerged from the corridor – probably to see where their friend had gone to. Valora cast them a quick glance, almost as a greeting, and was about to relax again, when she saw who one of the girls was.<br>
<br>
"What in the- Valora? Unbelievable!" smiled Shaila. She was a tall girl, much taller than Valora, big-breasted and long-legged with long, chestnut hair. "What in the world happened to you?"<br>
<br>
"It's, uh, nothing really," Valora tried, doing her best to look nonchalant. "Some girls took my dress as a joke, that's all."<br>
<br>
"Huh. Hold it." Shaila said with a glance to the black-haired girl. "So you ran down here to get a new one, is that it?"<br>
<br>
"Y- yeah." Valora replied.<br>
<br>
Shaila advanced on her, a threatening, playful look on her face. "That's brave of you. Of course, you still had that... thing to wear."<br>
<br>
"Yes, well. I need my dress, I'm sure you need your things from the laundry room as well." Valora tried, speaking quickly. "Should we get going?"<br>
<br>
"Actually..." Shaila glanced up and down her body mischievously. "We just need some rags. Anything will do, really."<br>
<br>
She beckoned the third girl closer, a pretty tall brunette like herself. Valora could see where this was going, and she sidled along the wall, trying to get to an exit. She looked to the black-haired girl, but she was standing passively behind Shaila and her crony.<br>
<br>
"Get her." Shaila called. The other girl lunged forwards, and Valora darted to the side – almost in time! The other girl grabbed on to the towel, and she was much stronger: Valora threw herself backwards, holding on to the towel, and it flew from her body, stretching out in a tug-of-war with the other girl. She was bare naked once more: Her petite breasts bounced as she tugged on the towel, and her naked feet planted themselves firmly on the stone floor. Then she saw Shaila darting for her, and she had to make a split-second decision. She let go of the towel, and ran for it.<br>
<br>
Stark naked, she bolted out into the stairway once more and began running up it. The other girls ran after her, but it didn't seem like they would bother with the steps: Instead they just looked after her, as her little buttocks flexed with every step she took.<br>
<br>
"Let her go." Shaila said. "She's not coming back here, and I certainly don't mind the idea of her running around naked. Imagine how she must look..."

        <span class="new-text">A Nobel Lady</span>
    </h1>
</div>

<p>
"This castle sure has a lot of stairs", thought Frieda as she descended behind Lady Rozabela. She had no idea where they were going, but it was evident that the Lady did – they were taking another way down than Frieda had gone on her way up, which was a relief to her: She had no wish to have another run-in with the marble statue. They passed by other, similar decorations as they walked – tall black knights, leering gargoyles, and beautiful mermaids – but if any of these were magical, they did not tip their hands about it; every statue they passed by remained still, as stone ought to behave.<br>
<br>
Frieda kept a close eye on her surroundings, so that she would be able to find her way back – and she saw many marvels in the castle, great stained-glass windows and massive tapestries depicting heroes of old. There was a certain garishness to much of it, however: It seemed Safira cared more for showing off than she cared for actual beauty. Not so with the Lady Rozabela, who was genuinely gorgeous, and carried herself with an air of elegance: One hardly noticed the sparkling tiara or the glittering gemstones upon her fingers. Frieda would love to find out more about her, but she knew to play the role of servant, and held her tongue.<br>
<br>
Eventually, after what seemed like a very long journey indeed, they came into some sort of sitting-room or foyer, which was full of people. Frieda shied back a little, and for a moment was reminded of the embarrassing fact that she wasn't wearing panties, but she composed herself quite quickly: She was entering behind Lady Rozabela, and nobody in the room would be paying any attention to a lowly servant.<br>
<br>
She was right. A handsome, blue-clad gentleman in a powdered wig immediately sprang to his feet, and hurried up to greet the Lady. All eyes and ears in the room were concentrated on their conversation, including Frieda's own.<br>
<br>
"My Lady Rozabela! How good to finally see you! Why, you look positively radiant."<br><br>
"Thank you, Lord Vilhelmo," she responded with a coy smile. "I hope I have not kept you too long?"<br><br>
"Not at all, not at all. The dancing hasn't even started yet."<br><br>
"Oh good, I would hate to miss any of the merriment. Excuse me, I see Sir Koralo is here..."<br>
<br>
The Lady was soon swept up in conversation with many acquaintances, and seemed to have forgotten of Frieda entirely. Perhaps that was just as well, she reflected, as she hesitantly retreated from the ladys' side – this would give her opportunity to explore on her own. She was just about to leave the sitting-room when a bell rang, and the conversation in the sitting-room instantly died down.<br>
<br>
"I believe that is our cue," said Sir Koralo, a black-haired man with well-combed hair and a tiny little mustache, "We should get going. Servant girl!"<br>
<br>
Mentally, Frieda cursed herself for not having left the room sooner. "Yes?" she responded with as pleasing a smile as she could muster, which was difficult – Sir Koralo had noticed her, and evidently he liked what he saw. Shudders ran down Frieda's spine as their eyes met – or more accurately, as his eyes met her breasts.<br>
<br>
"Carry our drinks into the dance hall." he said, waving to a tray set on a low table. Frieda made a brief little curtsy and stepped to get the tray, bending over as little as she could to pick it up – she was glad she wasn't taller. Sir Koralo lingered a little, but as she straightened her back and turned around he followed the rest of the noblemen out through a curtain. Frieda followed them, hoping the man hadn't seen anything, and a magnificent ballroom came into view.<br>
<br>
They were standing atop a flight of white marble stairs, leading down onto a large dance floor, full of people dressed in all the colors of the rainbow. White pillars held up a vast ceiling, from which hung crystal candelabras and elaborate festoons; flowers were also hung on the walls and set in massive vases on the floor. Across from the staircase was the stage with black-clad musicians: Their violins filled the room with an ethereal music, that seemed to mix and mingle with the smell of flowers. The mumbling sounds of the crowd had been drowning out the soft sound of strings, but now it had stopped: Lady Rozabela was descending the staircase, and the crowd fell silent.<br>
<br>
If not for the violins, one could have heard a pin drop. Just as when she had entered the foyer, every eye was upon her. Slowly she stepped down the stairs, and the elegant Lord Vilhelmo at her side seemed more like a page-boy than a nobleman in comparison to her. She smiled and blushed a little, which only made her seem more lovely – evidently the attention troubled her a little. Knowing now that Lady Rozabela was someone of importance, Frieda hurried slightly to keep up with her, to strengthen the illusion of being her personal servant.<br>
<br>
As Rozabelas' foot touched the floor, it seemed as though the spell had been broken: The murmur of the crowd resumed. She glided out on the floor with Vilhelmo at her right-hand side and Frieda on the other, and headed for a little table full of hors d'oeuvres. Before she reached it, though, it seemed like she spotted something, because she stopped and turned, looking towards her left. The crowd was parting.<br>
<br>
Towards the three of them came a woman. She was clad in scarlet, with black hair tied up on her head so that only two bangs fell before her face. Her dress was slim and high-necked, enhancing how tall and thin she was, and near her feet it split and fanned out to reveal black high-heeled shoes. Her face was not unpleasant, but it mostly gave an impression of menace, with high-curved eyebrows and thick black lashes that made her already dark eyes seem darker. She held a goblet in her thin hand, filled with red wine, and the other was extended towards Rozabela. Frieda ducked to the side and quickly set down her tray, for she knew without a doubt that this must be the hostess: The sorceress Safira.<br>
<br>
Lady Rozabela made a polite curtsy. "Your grace Safira." she said with a shy smile, "I am honored."<br>
<br>
A smile passed over Safira's face as well, but it vanished as quickly as it had appeared. "Rozabela, is it?" she asked, "I notice you arrived a little fashionably late."<br>
<br>
"Oh," said the lady with an embarrassed giggle, "I am sorry. It took some time before my servant arrived."<br>
<br>
"Is that so." responded Safira, looking uninterested. "Well, it was not such a problem, was it? My, what a spectacular entrance you made."<br>
<br>
"Thank you."<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed. You had the attention of the entire room, I dare say. I suppose you must have enjoyed it."<br>
<br>
"Oh, I am not so much for attention, my Lady Safira. I-"<br>
<br>
"Really, now? You certainly seemed to bask in the admiration you were getting as you descended the stairs. Why, every eye in the room was upon you. It was almost as if-" a sudden, shrill little laughter escaped the sorceress, "It was almost as if you were the hostess, and not I."<br>
<br>
"Oh, I am sure nobody could have been mistaken." responded Rozabela, and there was the slightest note of fear in her voice now. Frieda could hear it, and a part of her felt fearful too. Another part of her, however, was ecstatic, for she had spotted something: The sorceress wore a golden chain about her hip, and on that chain hung several jewel-encrusted keys. She inched a little closer, as the conversation continued.<br>
<br>
"Really?" said Safira, and the laughter was gone from her eyes now. "Well, I am sure you are the sort of woman who often gets mistaken for being more important than she is."<br>
<br>
"Oh, not at all, my Lady Safira. I am quite content with my role."<br>
<br>
"You certainly do not behave like it. You behave like someone who wants to be the center of attention. Well, let it not be said that I don't treat my guests well! If you want attention, I shall give it to you."<br>
<br>
The sorceress smiled, and raised a hand. Nonchalantly, she passed her goblet to the nearest servant, who happened to be Frieda.<br>
<br>
"Oh no, please, Lady Safira, I did not wish to-"<br>
<br>
Safira snapped her fingers. The great opal fell from Rozabela's breast and landed with a clatter on the floor; her chest puffed out a little as the constraints on the pink dress were suddenly removed. Her eyes widened in shock.<br>
<br>
"My, what a lovely dress that is." commented Safira. "But I'll bet what you're wearing underneath is lovelier still."<br>
<br>
"Please, I do not wish to-"<br>
<br>
Safia extended her index finger, and made a slow motion downwards through the air. A thin yellow light appeared at the top of Rozabela's cleavage, and traveled rapidly downwards across the front of her dress.<br>
<br>
"I do not wish to cause you any trouble, Lady Safira. Please, do not take offense at my behavior, it was quite unintentional. I did not mean to upset you, not in the slightest. You must-"<br>
<br>
The light had reached the floor now, and Safira made a casual gesture. There was a loud noise, as of paper being torn, and the beautiful pink dress split down the middle with a flash! Each half flew violently to the sides, floating down to land on a small table and on Lord Vilhelmo, much to his surprise.<br>
<br>
The crowd had gone silent. Lady Rozabela stood in the center of the room, clad now in the purest snow white. Her white silken chemise was not much more revealing than her pink dress, but it was clearly an undergarment. One could see her pink shoes and white stockings, but only to the ankles, and her breasts were outlined much more clearly now with just thin silk constraining them.<br>
<br>
Safira gave a cruel smile. "Is that better? All the eyes of the room are on you, again."<br>
<br>
"I- I-"<br>
<br>
Rozabela's face was getting flushed, and her pale white skin slowly changed into rosy red. Without another word, she turned on her heel to leave, but something seemed to stop her: It was as though she had seen something standing in her way, although Frieda could not make out what it was.<br>
<br>
"Where are you going?" asked Safira sweetly. "We've barely only started."<br>
<br>
Rozabela was walking backwards away from whatever it was she saw, getting closer to Safira. "I do not wish to cause any commotion, Lady Safira," she said, trying to stay composed although there was a hint of panic in her voice now, not just fear. "I- I intend to leave."<br>
<br>
"Oh, but that would be rude. Now that I have gone through so much effort to be a good hostess, why would you leave? Casting spells is rather difficult, you know."<br>
<br>
"Well then, my Lady, I shan't trouble you with any further requests," responded Rozabela quickly. "I am... quite content."<br>
<br>
"Oh, but I insist!"<br>
<br>
With that, Safira twirled her finger in the air, and white sparkles followed its trajectory. The same sparkling white magic began to travel up Rozabela's chemise, starting at her ankles and spiraling its way around and around. Where it went, the chemise simply... disappeared. It became shorter and shorter, and Rozabela did not dare move for fear of touching the shimmering magic.<br>
<br>
Little by little, the hem of her chemise traveled. Her shins came into view, then her knees, and then it begun creeping up her thighs, slowing down now to reveal them little by little, inch by inch. Her white stockings were chiffon, and so tight that every detail about her legs was plainly visible. Just before the sparkling sorcery reached far enough to reveal more than her thighs, they stopped. Rozabela breathed a sigh of relief, but then they appeared on her arms instead. This time Safira didn't bother moving slowly – she spun her finger, and in a flash, Rozabela's chemise had become sleeveless.<br>
<br>
Frieda hastily took a few steps back. She had been so close to reaching the keys, and had counted on Safira staying distracted for a while longer – but the sorceress returned her hands to her hips, and it seemed the spell was finished.<br>
<br>
"That's better." spoke the hostess, looking over the undressed Rozabela with a critical expression. "It suits you."<br>
<br>
Rozabela's blush had worsened now, and the stark contrast to her snow-white clothes made her skin seem even redder. She looked about in panic, but saw no escape – and now there really was none, for the crowd had closed around them. People were approaching to see what was going on, and their expressions varied: Some were looking on in shock and fear, others wore the same evil smirk as Safira herself. A good portion of the men were simply gawking at the lady wearing nothing but her undergarments.<br>
<br>
Rozabela swallowed, trying to regain her composure. "Thank you." she said, with a very embarrassed smile, avoiding Safira's eyes. "I, um, I think so too."<br>
<br>
"Oh good." said the sorceress, in a voice like honey laced with arsenic, "Does it feel good, having everyones' eyes upon you once more?"<br>
<br>
Lady Rozabela shifted. It was clear she didn't know what she ought to respond. She cast glances to her left and right, but saw only the crowd. Then her eyes met Friedas'. The thief, worried that others might see where she was looking, quickly nodded and gave a quick shrug.<br>
<br>
"It... it does, thank you." said Rozabela, with as pleasant a smile as she could manage, and actually gathering the strength to look Safira in the eye.<br>
<br>
"Good", smiled Safira in response, and abruptly turned around, beginning to walk away. "Please, enjoy the party." Once more the crowd parted, and Rozabela breathed a visible sign of relief. Frieda cursed quietly as Safira left – she had been so close to getting those keys, and now it looked the chance was slipping out of her hands.<br>
<br>
Rozabela, blushing, made her way towards Lord Vilhelmo, who wore a sympathetic expression; even he, though, could not avoid casting a glance at her body. "Let's get you out of here, my Lady." he said quietly, but she shook her head. "Did you not hear her? She told me to stay. Oh, I need to take a seat."<br>
<br>
The Lady sank down on a red-cushioned chair, careful to keep her legs together and looking anxiously at the hem of her chemise. It slipped up ever so slightly, and she could not help but to tug at it slightly, trying to look as lady-like as she could; it wasn't very successful. The eyes of the crowd were still upon her, rather than the sorceress, and it was clear she could feel it. She cleared her throat and fanned herself with her hand. "Ahem. Could anyone be a dear and fetch me a drink?" she said with an awkward smile.<br>
<br>
"Of course," responded Vilhelmo, "A drink for the lady!" he called out, snapping his fingers.<br>
<br>
A white-clad servant girl heard his call and reacted instantly. She reached for a goblet on the tray that Frieda had set down, and walked eagerly with it to Lady Rozabela, who took it gratefully. She smiled and raised her glass politely to Lord Vilhelmo before she brought it to her lips. Just as the glass was about to touch her mouth, though, she made a sudden jump and a slight yelp as if something had surprised her; the glass fell out of her hand, and Vilhelmo leaped to catch it – but too late. The glass tumbled down to land in her lap; the contents were splashed across her breasts.<br>
<br>
Frieda took a half-step away, hiding behind the servant who had brought the drink. She hoped nobody had seen her tickle the lady's armpit; it shamed her to torment the innocent woman so, but she badly needed some distraction if she were to steal those keys. And what a distraction this was! A big dark patch was spreading across Rozabela's bosoms, and though one needed sharp eyes to see them, the shape of her nipples was visible through the wet fabric. A gasp ran through the crowd, and Lady Rozabela clutched her bosoms in a most unladylike fashion. It looked as if she wanted to scream, but no sound came out.<br>
<br>
Even the musicians fell silent. The only sound one could hear was the clack-clack-clack of high heels. Safira was returning, and she seemed quite amused.<br>
<br>
"Well, well, well." she said. "All that, and you still want to bring more attention to yourself?"<br>
<br>
It seemed like Rozabela wanted to respond, but her lips did not obey her – she just stared dumbly at the sorceress. "I- I'm so sorry." she finally managed to say, but the hostess silenced her with a gesture.<br>
<br>
"Are you now?" said the sorceress sweetly. "Don't be. It's clear you enjoy having people watch you. Well then, let's give them a reason to look, shall we?"<br>
<br>
The sorceress raised a fist into the air, and it began to hum with arcane energy.<br>
<br>
"P- please, I only meant to-"<br>
<br>
Safira ignored her. Slowly, she began to open her fist, and as she did, it was as if some invisible force appeared between Rozabela's knees. Little by little, they were forced apart, and the skimpy chemise glided upwards, inch by inch. Rozabela's panties were not white like her other undergarments, but pink like the dress, made of the finest silk and with little white lacy details along the sides.<br>
<br>
"Beautiful." Safira commented. "So beautiful, I expect you were planning to show them off the entire time. Am I right?"<br>
<br>
"N- no! Of course not!" protested Rozabela as she looked incredulously at her legs, still hugging her breasts. "I- I intended no such thing!"<br>
<br>
Safira ignored her. "What of your bra? Is it also pink?"<br>
<br>
Somehow this question seemed to embarrass Rozabela even more than anything that had happened to her thus far. She lowered her head so much that nothing of her face was visible, and she almost begun to shake slightly. A sound, no more than a whimper, escaped her.<br>
<br>
"What was that?"<br>
<br>
"N-no. White." came the whimper again, slightly louder now.<br>
<br>
"Oh, that won't do. That won't do at all." said Safira with a thoughtful expression. "No, one of them will have to go. We can't do with underwear that don't match. Which one would you prefer?"<br>
<br>
Rozabela looked up slightly, but not enough that one could clearly see her face. "Wh- what?" she asked. Safira sighed.<br>
<br>
"Would you prefer to keep your panties, or your bra? It's an easy question, really."<br>
<br>
Rozabela fell silent for what seemed like a very long time, as Safira just quietly stared at her. Finally, she responded: "P-panties-"<br>
<br>
"Getting rid of the panties, is it? All right, then."<br>
<br>
"N- no, wait! I thought-"<br>
<br>
Safira closed her fist again, and Rozabela's legs were once more pulled together. She squirmed uncomfortably in her seat as Safira pulled her fist towards her chest, and then began to lower it "I thought you asked- which I wanted to keep!" protested the chemise-clad woman, but it was in vain: The unseen force was already pulling her underpants along her thighs. It was as if many invisible fingers had hooked themselves to the waistband, and were pulling them along. Helplessly, Rozabela watched as they reached her knees. "N- No! Take my bra instead! Please!" she protested, "Take the bra!"<br>
<br>
"Take the bra? All right then." smiled Safira. Her free hand shot up into the air as well, and she made an elegant, snapping motion. Rozabela was still hugging her chest, so it was hard to see anything – but her bra clasp had come undone, and with two more snaps, the shoulder-straps had been cut as well. As this happened, her panties continued their slow but inevitable journey, passing by her knees and falling to the floor. "I- I didn't mean-" said Rozabela, but it was too late. Safira made a gesture, and the bra made itself free of her breasts to hover upwards, escaping through her décolletage. Obediently, it proceeded to fly through the air until it landed in the sorceress' outstretched hand.<br>
<br>
Only now did Rozabela react. She moved to reach for her panties, probably to grab them before they, too, flew off. She released her breasts, and though the wet chemise still covered them, her nipples were plainly visible through it; they were rather large, and quite perky from the cold drink. The panties were struggling to fly towards the sorceress as well, but they were still caught on her shoes, and she managed to grab them. Struggling so that her liberated bust dangled back and forth alluringly, she pulled against the magical force, trying to drag the panties back up her legs. It looked as though she would succeed – little by little, the unseen force was giving up.<br>
<br>
Safira, however, simply yawned and tossed the bra over her shoulder. Just when the panties were back at Rozabela's legs, she clapped her hands. There was a brilliant flash of light, and the Lady shot back to sit up straight, holding a bunch of pink gardenias. Confusion ruled her expression for a moment, before the realization dawned on her, and she squeezed her legs together even tighter, shutting her eyes and looking like she was on the verge of tears, staring at the flowers that had once been her underwear.<br>
<br>
"Let's see, we've got... gloves, stockings, shoes, tiara, necklace, rings... am I missing anything?" asked Safira to the crowd in general, pointing at Rozabela and counting the garments. Surprisingly, there was a response:<br>
<br>
"She is also wearing the chemise, my Lady Safira."<br>
<br>
It was Sir Koralo who had spoken. He had made his way to the forefront of the crowd and was looking at the half-naked Lady with great interest. An smirk was on his face as he twirled his little mustache, turning only briefly from the sight to give Safira a curt bow.<br>
<br>
"Is she?" responded Safira loudly. It was an angry tone, but there was some hint of playfulness to it. "Are you saying that I, Safira the sorceress, am mistaken?"<br>
<br>
Koralo looked hesitant. "Er..." he began, "I believe..."<br>
<br>
"Look again, Sir Koralo! Look again, then tell me that I am wrong!"<br>
<br>
Koralo looked, and an astonished smile appeared on his face. "Wh- why, what a goose I am!" he declared, "Of course the Lady Safira is never mistaken."<br>
<br>
Hearing this, Rozabela opened her eyes. She saw her gloved arms, hugging her breasts, and she saw her white stockings on her thighs – but she could not see a trace of white cloth on her bosom, and the cold of the wet cloth had been replaced with a different sort of cold entirely...<br>
<br>
She shrieked, folding over with one arm across her breasts and the other across her naked lap. The Lady Safira was correct: Except for her shoes, stockings, gloves, and garter-belt, she was stark naked! Though she could not possibly blush more, she felt hotter with shame than ever before, and wished with all her heart that she could but sink through the ground – but of course, Lady Rozabela was no sorceress, and far from capable of such feats.<br>
<br>
"You've had your wish, Lady Rozabela." smiled Safira. "You're the life of the party! The center of attention! The main attraction!" she said, flinging her arms out like a circus director. "Congratulations!"<br>
<br>
Rozabela did not respond. She was too busy shutting her eyes, wishing to be somewhere else. Safira turned away from her, facing the crowd, and Sir Koralo in particular.<br>
<br>
"Make sure she stays." she told him. "I don't want her to miss out on anything, now that her wish has been granted. Musicians!" she shouted, "Play us a waltz! I think it is time for some dancing!"<br>
<br>
A grin spread across Sir Koralo's face as he nodded to Lady Safira. "Of course." He made a deep bow, shooting a glance sideways at the naked Lady. "And we would not want the guest of honor to miss out on the dancing either, I suspect?"<br>
<br>
"Naturally not. Now excuse me; I promised Sir Aleksandro he would get the first dance. I had better go find him."<br>
<br>
"Ah, of course, my lady. Of course."<br>
<br>
As soon as she had left, Sir Koralo turned around and strode quickly towards Lady Rozabela, an evil smile on his face. He was cut off, however, as a blue jacket appeared in his view, blocking his progress. It was Lord Vilhelmo.<br>
<br>
"My Lady, excuse me," he said while shooting a hateful glance at Sir Koralo, "May I have this dance?"<br>
<br>
Rozabela looked up at the Lord Vilhelmo's face, and saw Sir Koralo leer at her from over his shoulder. She swallowed. "Wh- why, Vilhelmo, I would love to." she said with an unsteady smile. On shaking legs, knowing that both Safira and Koralo – and mostly everyone else in the room – was watching her, she stood up to face him. Her shapely, bare breasts jiggled as she shook uneasily, and for the first time the room could see her naked bottom as she stepped away from the chair. It was rather small, and surprisingly firm, quivering like the rest of her with nervousness and cold. Uneasily, she grabbed Lord Vilhelmo's shoulder, and glided out on the floor in a naked waltz.<br>
<br>
By this time, however, Frieda was long-gone: She was headed for the cellar, clutching Lady Safira's keys.

    </h1>
</div>

<p>
Valora was huddling behind a statue. She was shivering, partly from cold but also with rage. How could they do this to her? It was bad enough that they had stopped her from getting to the laundry room, but that they had also stolen the tiny towel... it made her furious. Sure, it hadn't been clothes, but at least it had been something. What could she do now?<br>
<br>
Briefly she sat down on the base of the statue, but she immediately flew up again with a yelp – it was like putting her bare buttocks on a block of ice. Rubbing her rosy-red bottom, she looked around nervously. “I can't stay here.” she mumbled nervously to herself. “I need to get moving.”<br>
<br>
But where to? The laundry room was guarded by Shaila and her goons. There were no clothes back in the dormitories, and she didn't know the layout of the castle well enough to find any other place where there might be clothes. Nervously, she paced back and forth, trying to think of something – but her thought process was interrupted when she heard steps echoing from downstairs. She froze up in panic, and looked around: There was nowhere to hide. Well, that settled it – she was going away from the stairs.<br>
<br>
She dashed down the corridor as quietly as she could, rounding a corner. A door stood open there, and she tiptoed up to it, looking inside. Empty! What luck! She quickly slipped into the chamber. It was some sort of trophy room: Swords, axes and crossbows were hanging on the wall, taken from Safira's defeated enemies – and the head of a great lizard hung above the fireplace. Valora looked around: There was nothing to wear in the room, but there were great sofas with soft embroidered cushions, and long red drapes hung down the walls, which helped preserve heat. With the fire in the fireplace, the temperature was actually quite comfortable, even for someone in her birthday suit. <br>
<br>
She turned to close the door behind her, and almost couldn't believe her eyes: The key was in the lock! Delighted, she turned it, and heard a soft click: She was safe. The room didn't have any other exits or entrances. Sure, she still didn't have any clothes, but at least she was comfortably warm and could think uninterrupted. Nervously she took a few steps into the chamber, and had to admit she felt excited. Even if she had been fully clothed, she was definitely not supposed to be in here. She gently ran her hand across the armrest of a sofa – it was very soft. Giggling slightly, she picked up one of the decorative pillows and hugged it carefully. A golden tassel tickled her nipple and she shivered, though pleasantly this time. <br>
<br>
She hesitated for a long time before she finally did it: Hugging the pillow, she sat down on the velvet seat of the sofa. First she sat rigidly, upright, but little by little she leaned backwards until she was comfortably at rest. She crossed her legs, then uncrossed them, then crossed them again. <br>
<br>
“I'm sitting on velvet. Expensive velvet. Naked.” she said quietly, as if saying it made it definite that it was actually happening. “I can't believe it.” <br>
<br>
She turned towards the fire and let it warm her feet. They felt like icicles, and now they were slowly thawing. She leaned backwards, stretching out her body with her feet closer to the flames. The pleasant warmth slowly spread from her feet, upwards to her knees, then along her thighs... She placed the embroidered cushion behind her head, and adjusted her position a little. Soon, she was lying down, letting the warmth of the fire wash over her.<br>
<br>
There was a rustling in the lock. How long had she been asleep?<br>
She sat up, looking around in confusion: Nobody was in the room yet, but there was a sound at the door and she heard muffled voices from outside. She practically flew from the sofa. There weren't any exits, and now the door was opening...!<br>
<br>
“I assure you, Sir Aleksandro, the proof is in here. A simple spell was all it took to defeat her. See that sword upon the wall? That used to be hers.” spoke a woman's voice.<br>
<br>
There was a number of oohs and aahs from the other people in the room. “What became of the woman herself?” asked a man. <br>
<br>
“Oh,” Safira laughed, “I rendered her quite... harmless.”<br>
<br>
There was amused laughter from the crowd. Abruptly, though, Sir Aleksandro spoke, cutting it short. “Eh... Lady Safira, what is that, behind the curtain?”<br>
<br>
“What? Oh... I don't know.”<br>
<br>
Valora heard Safira snap her fingers, and then blinked. The long red drapery crashed to the floor, revealing her – in all her glory – to a good half-dozen men and women, including Mistress Safira herself. The latter was smiling.<br>
<br>
“What's this, then? Uh-uh-” she added, wagging a finger, “Don't you cover up.”<br>
<br>
Valora was blushing madly. It was as if she could literally feel the mistresses' gaze wander across her bare skin, and in contrast to the overdressed nobles, she felt more naked than ever. She fought the urge to cover herself. <br>
<br>
“Explain.” said Safira simply. <br>
<br>
Valora swallowed. “Someone stole my clothes.” she whimpered, “It wasn't my fault! Really!”<br>
<br>
“And you are?” <br>
<br>
“V- Valora...”<br>
<br>
“So, someone stole your clothes. That doesn't explain what you are doing here.”<br>
<br>
“I... Well, I was going to go to the laundry room, but um. It was locked.”<br>
<br>
“You ran out into the corridors stark naked?” Safira smiled. “You are either brave, or very...”, the sorceress looked her up and down, “...naughty.”<br>
<br>
A shower of amused laughter came again from the nobles. Valora was looking at her feet, trying her best to ignore everyone. “I- I asked Rubena to go for me-” she tried to explain, “But she wouldn't.”<br>
<br>
Safira looked strangely surprised. “Who's Rubena?”<br>
<br>
“She- she's a servant, like me.”<br>
<br>
“No she isn't.” Safira suddenly looked a lot more threatening. “I don't employ anyone by that name. Did she steal your clothes?”<br>
<br>
“I- I guess she might have, yeah. I-” <br>
<br>
“Don't cover up!” Safira snapped, and Valora withdrew her hands. She had unconsciously clasped her hands in front of her crotch. “What did she look like?”<br>
<br>
“She had... red hair. And she was fairly short.”<br>
<br>
Safira looked to be deep in thought, and turned away from Valora. Breathing in relief, the servant-girl turned away a little and hugged herself, getting some relief from the intense stares of Sir Aleksandro. “I thought there was something strange about that servant... I don't remember any short redheads. I'm afraid I will have to look into this.”<br>
<br>
Valora whimpered a little, inching away from the sorceress – but she seemed to have forgotten entirely about the servant by now. Instead, she turned to Sir Aleksandro and the little group of people accompanying them. “I am sorry, but I must leave. There might be an infiltrator.”<br>
<br>
Aleksandro seemed quite impressed. “You remember all your servants?” he said incredulously. “Of course.” Safira replied irritably, “Any sorceress must have supreme memory. Now if you excuse me, I need to find out where she is. Oh, don't worry, good folk. There's no danger or anything. It's just that... when I find her, she'll make a fine spectacle at the ball.” she smiled. “Perhaps she can take some of the burden of entertainment off Lady Rozabela's shoulders. Ah! I sense a spell in the dungeons has been broken. I must be off.”<br>
<br>
Without another word, Safira left the room. The crowd looked after her as she left, then fell silent. Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Valora, but now they turned back to her, looking expectant. She was cowering behind a sofa. <br>
<br>
“Well?” asked Sir Aleksandro, a towering man with long blond hair. <br>
<br>
“Uh... what?” asked Valora.<br>
<br>
“Well, aren't you going to resume your work?” <br>
<br>
“I'm... sort of...” <br>
<br>
“Pish-posh,” said a lady with a venomous smile. “We could use a servant. We are quite unattended, after all. Come, come.” she beckoned. <br>
<br>
Valora swallowed, coming out reluctantly from the sofa. “Wh- where will your ladyship be going?” she asked hesitantly.<br>
<br>
“Why, the main ballroom of course. Shan't we?”<br>
<br>
There was a unanimous mumbling of agreements. Valora closed her eyes: This couldn't be happening...
</p>

<p>
It appeared the spell of protection from the elements did not extend into Safira's dungeons – or else they were just naturally this cold – for Frieda was shivering. Granted, she reminded herself, she wasn't exactly dressed for the occasion, as she was stark naked under the white, flimsy servants' dress. Apart from the cold and the uncomfortable sensation that she would show her secrets if she bent over too much, though, she was doing very well.<br>
<br>
The dungeons were surprisingly easy to navigate, and not so well defended – it seemed Safira trusted that nobody could make it inside her castle without being detected. This assumption was good luck for Frieda: She had made it down the stairs without any problem at all, and was now walking through a long, dark corridor. She had no source of light, but it didn't matter – years of practicing thievery had given her quite good night-vision, and there was a little illumination filtering out from doors and through apertures.<br>
<br>
She listened at a few doors, and peered in through cracks where it was possible: Some seemed to house guards or staff, and these she avoided, sneaking past them without a sound. Others were empty and unlit, and these too she avoided – she knew Safira's vanity, and any room with truly valuable treasures would likely always be lit, to allow her to show them off.<br>
<br>
Occasionally she would duck to the side, hiding in the shadow as a guard patrol passed her. The white dress did impair her ability to meld into the shadows, but she found that it didn't matter – the guards were inattentive and spent most of their time talking, much like the two who had been watching the front gate. There would be trouble if she was discovered – she was not certain she could fight them off, especially not without her knife – but she stayed sharp, and sneaked past two, four, six patrols without any trouble.<br>
<br>
Then she turned a corner, and stopped dead in her tracks. Before her was a long corridor leading up to a pair of jade-green double doors. Bright light was streaming out from underneath them, and two large  statues stood to either side of them, set in alcoves. Without a doubt, Frieda knew that she had reached her destination: Safira's main treasury. The statues resembled the one that had troubled her earlier: Tall women sculpted from white marble, naked but for brass helmets and shields, each holding a marble spear. Frieda stopped and considered.<br>
<br>
Without a doubt these constructs were magical as well. Unfortunately, even if they fell for her disguise, it was unlikely they would let a servant pass. Frieda knew from experience how freakishly strong the statues were – in a straight-up conflict with them, she would not stand a chance. At least she was prepared for their speed and strength, this time. Cautiously, she approached them.<br>
<br>
She got surprisingly close before they reacted – when their deep alto voices rang out in unison, she was less than five paces away from the door.<br>
<br>
Young girl, this door you may not pass,<br>
Our spears of stone, our shields of brass,<br>
Will strike you down, so go, begone<br>
Or else you'll never see the dawn!<br>
<br>
Frieda looked at the statues, able to inspect them quite well now that she was so close. She marveled momentarily at the realism of their make – they were perfectly identical, down to the smallest creases in their naked, milky-white skin. Her eyes wandered over their bodies, then fell on their weapons: The spears gave a regal look, but they were rather long and did not seem perfectly designed for use in a confined corridor like this. She glanced at the ceiling, then at the walls, trying to measure the distance; it would be possible for the statues to wield their weapons, but it certainly wouldn't be easy.<br>
<br>
She took a deep breath. Okay, so this would be the dangerous part. The previous statue had just tried to undress her – and it had essentially succeeded. These would seriously attempt to hurt her. She would only have one shot, but she had a plan.<br>
<br>
Slowly, measuring the corridor, she backed away from the statues. “One... two... three!”<br>
<br>
She broke into a flat-out run, straight towards the door. Breathing quickly, she kept her eyes on the spot where the statues had started speaking. Just before she reached it, she tensed her legs and took a mighty leap!<br>
<br>
The statues moved so quickly it was almost a blur. Both of them lowered their spears and pointed them straight at Frieda, who had just reached the door. She slammed into the door with all four limbs before her, and bounced straight off it, taking another mighty jump back where she had came from!<br>
<br>
She landed kneeling on the floor, and heard a loud crash behind her. Turning around, she saw that she had been successful: As she had suspected, the statues acted in perfect unison. When she had jumped past, both of them had stabbed at the same spot, and their lances had met. The resulting force had shattered them, disarming both of the marble women.<br>
<br>
Spinning around, she ran back towards the door. The ploy had worked: The marble statues could not leave their bases, and without their spears they simply could not reach her. Fruitlessly they waved their empty hands in the air, and Valora could safely ignore them. She inspected the door: It was locked, but she had the keys. The doors clicked open smoothly.<br>
<br>
Frieda had to catch her breath – not from the effort, but from the sight that appeared before her eyes.<br>
<br>
The treasury was just as marvelous as she had imagined it. Piles of gold and silver glittered in massive iron-bound chests, mingling with brilliant diamonds and blood-red rubies. The very air seemed to sparkle, and the room smelled of myrrh and incense. Frieda took a few steps into the room, her blue eyes wide open and reflecting the splendor of the great treasure vault.<br>
<br>
She could not possibly carry the gold and the silver, but there were fabled treasures greater still, and she scanned the room, seeing them set upon mahogany tables and obsidian pedestals: The Crystal Phylactery, the Firefly Comb, the Abacus of Pearls... She could not make up her mind, which to take.<br>
<br>
Then, abruptly, the silence was broken by loud, slow, clapping hands.<br>
<br>
“This is a first.” she heard a voice call out behind her, and slowly turned: Through the jade-green doors came a woman clad in scarlet, with black hair tied elegantly above her head. Her already cruel face was twisted into an unusually wicked expression: It was the sorceress Safira, and she was clearly not pleased with the situation.<br>
<br>
“Well done, thief. Nobody has broke into my treasury before. You would probably have gotten away with it too – fortunately, I received a warning from one of my servants. Your little adventure ends here, though the finale will be grand. I like to... ah, toy with my enemies.” she finished with a wicked smile.<br>
<br>
Frieda had already scanned the chamber completely in the short time that Safira had spoken. There were no other exits: The sorceress was between her and the only way out. Furthermore, there was very little to hide behind except chests and little tables full of precious goods. The sorceress was a force to be reckoned with, but Frieda had no choice: She would have to try to run past her. It was fortunate that nothing else stood in the way.<br>
<br>
She snatched the Firefly Comb, and bolted straight for her adversary. Safira merely smiled and raised a finger: A bright purple flash emerged, but Frieda – strangely – felt nothing. The sorceress, on the other hand, suddenly fell over.<br>
<br>
The surprise caused Frieda to stop. Was this some sort of trick? Suddenly, Safira was awkwardly seated on the ground, staring up at her. Between the sorceresses' ankles ran a thin, purple chain: They had been linked together!<br>
<br>
“What is this?” shouted Safira incredulously. “You know magic, too?”<br>
<br>
Frieda took a step backwards, for the sorceress was raising a fist now, and a thin orange flame danced around it. “A witches' duel, is it? That certainly changes things. I won't hold back!”<br>
<br>
The thief raised her arms to shield herself, and was about to protest, but then there was an explosion of flame. She expected to feel searing pain, but there was nothing. She blinked to clear her eyes – she wasn't even sooty. Safira, on the other hand, was covered in ash, and her beautiful scarlet dress had been singed so badly that little remained of the sleeves.<br>
<br>
“You are good!” said Safira, looking half-crazed by now. “But you won't be good enough!” She struggled to get back to her feet, bracing herself against a pedestal. Frieda snapped out of her confusion and surprise: She wasn't about to lose the edge on an adversary, even if she couldn't understand what was going on. She threw herself into Safira and knocked her to the ground; the sorceress screamed angrily and waved her hands, and more streams and flashes of color emerged – as before, however, they did not even touch Frieda. Instead, yellow lights began to dance over Safira's dress, and she squirmed and struggled against some unseen force.<br>
<br>
Frieda sat down squarely on the sorceress, pinning her to the ground. Her white dress had slipped up in the brief mêlee, and she felt Safira's clothes tickle slightly against her exposed sex, but she tried to ignore it. She grabbed the sorceresses' arms, even though it made little difference: Something was already holding her down to the ground.<br>
<br>
“Let me go, you cretin!” protested Safira, trying to break free – but even without the unseen force, Frieda was much stronger than her. The thief was doing nothing but restrain her, though: She stared in fascination at the lights traveling across Safira's body. They highly resembled the light she had seen on Rozabela's dress, and she wondered if the spell was perhaps similar. A moment later, she was proven right.<br>
<br>
Safira's dress fell apart into little swaths of scarlet satin. She kicked and struggled to escape from the thief, but only managed to escape her shoes, kicking them away across the cold stone floor.<br>
<br>
“Lady Safira,” spoke Frieda for the first time. “Stop struggling. I have what I came for; there's no need to fight.”<br>
<br>
“No need to fight!? You come into my castle, you impersonate my servants, you break my guardians and now you're stealing my priceless artifacts! I'll show you a fight, wench!”<br>
<br>
It looked as though Safira planned to unleash some devastating spell. All she managed, though, was to squirm around so that the remains of her dress fell off her. Frieda bit her lip as she felt the sorceresses' hip grinding softly between her legs. “I'm going to let you go now.” said Frieda, worried that guards might arrive and see what she was doing to their poor mistress. She rolled away from the floored sorceress, who managed to fight her way to a sitting position. She wore only a black bodice and gossamer black skirts: Her legs were completely bare.<br>
<br>
Frieda turned to run from the room, but for once the sorceress was successful with a spell: She snapped her fingers, and the jade-green doors slammed shut. “Ha-ha!” she shouted confidently. “I have you now!”<br>
<br>
Frieda turned around to face her. For whatever reason, it seemed like Safira could still work her sorcery: Frieda was just somehow immune to it. Figuring her best chance was to trust her theory was correct, she adjusted her dress and crossed her arms. “Go on, then. Give me your best shot.”<br>
<br>
Safiras' eyes narrowed to thin slits, and she crossed her hands before her chest. She shouted out loudly, and her hands swept out: From them shot thousands of little blades and needles! Frieda closed her eyes and swallowed: She heard a swishing sound, then a confused yelp from the sorceress, but nothing else happened.<br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes, even the sorceresses' underclothes had been torn to shreds. She was quite unharmed, but her bodice hung about her bosom in tatters, and the little delicate skirts were mere wisps of black gossamer. The only intact garment she had was her little black panties. She was still seated, and looked quite dumbfounded.<br>
<br>
“Will you let me go now?” Frieda asked sensibly. “I don't think you're going to win this fight.”<br>
<br>
“Never!” protested Safira. “I don't know what sorcery protects you, but it cannot possibly be stronger than mine!”<br>
<br>
“What else can you do to me?” asked Frieda, “You can't set me aflame, you can't cut me, you can't trap me. Just let me go, and I'll be out of your life.”<br>
<br>
“I may not be able to touch your body... but let's see about your mind!” shouted Safira, and pressing the tattered bodice to her breasts with one hand, she extended another dramatically to shout:<br>
<br>
“Curse of slavish humility!”<br>
<br>
This time there were no visuals whatsoever. Frieda just blinked – had the spell even worked? Safira looked triumphant, however, and managed to climb to her feet despite her chained ankles and keeping one arm wrapped across her breasts.<br>
<br>
“Now surrender!” she commanded. “Bow down before me, thief!”<br>
<br>
“Uh, no?”<br>
<br>
“I said bow down! Prostrate yourself! Surrender to my will, slave!”<br>
<br>
“...yeah, I'll say 'no' to that as well.”<br>
<br>
“Impossible! There's no defense against this spell! None except...”<br>
<br>
Safira looked in panic around the room. Her eyes widened with shock as it seemed she came to some horrible realization. “...except the Firefly Comb!”<br>
<br>
Frieda looked down: The little ruby comb was still in her hand. It looked rather unremarkable, aside from being a fine comb carved from a perfect gem. Slightly perplexed, she placed the comb snugly in her hair.<br>
<br>
“So, let me guess. The Comb reflects magic?”<br>
<br>
“Um- n- no-” said Safira, looking like she didn't really think the lie would work herself. Frieda considered – she could guess what the spell should be doing.<br>
<br>
“Tell me if the Comb reflects magic or not.” she said.<br>
<br>
“Yes it does.” said Safira, almost automatically. She looked quite surprised, and brought a hand to cover her mouth. Her face didn't look menacing at all anymore – she was more reminiscent of a shy schoolgirl with too much make-up. Frieda looked her up and down.<br>
<br>
“Um, take a step forwards.” she tried. The sorceress took a very tiny step, restrained by the chain still between her ankles. “Spin around.” The sorceresses spun around in place, her bare feet shuffling across the stone floor.<br>
<br>
“You will regret this!” she said as she spun carefully in place. “I am not one to be trifled with!”<br>
<br>
“Tell me how long the Curse lasts.” commanded Frieda.<br>
<br>
“It's permanent.”<br>
<br>
“Never use it again.”<br>
<br>
The sorceress didn't visibly respond, but Frieda drew a breath of relief, glad to have disarmed such a dangerous spell. “Does that mean you'll have to obey me from here on?”<br>
<br>
“No,” lied Safira.<br>
<br>
“Uncover your chest.” Frieda said cautiously. The sorceress, still spinning in place, dropped both of her arms, and the remains of the bodice crashed to the ground. Her breasts came into view: They were of average size but quite shapely, pale and perky with rosy nipples. Their color was reflected in Safira's cheeks, which were turning a similar pink shade. She stood before a common thief, wearing only her panties and scraps of black gossamer, and the embarrassment she felt was quite apparent. Her last remaining garment only barely covered her shame, and unfortunately, Frieda was eying it.<br>
<br>
There was nothing cruel about the decision, really. Frieda was merely weary of the cold in her nether regions.<br>
<br>
“Stop spinning. Take off your panties and give them to me.” she said. Obediently, Safira bent down and pulled the panties down to around her ankles. There, however, they were halted by the purple chain. A look of spite came over Safira's face, and she tugged hard at the elegant undergarments: They ripped apart. Evidently, if she couldn't have them, nobody could. Obediently, she tossed the tattered rag to Frieda, and stood back up covering her crotch with her hands. She was stark naked now: What few strips of gossamer had remained had been attached to the panties. The thief looked at the destroyed panties, disappointed.<br>
<br>
Frieda sat down on a chest. “Stay right there.” she told Safira, who stood glaring angrily but said nothing. The thief thought, long and hard, but finally she stood up.<br>
<br>
“I came here to rob you, but it seems Fate has decided otherwise. Listen up: This is what we are going to do...”

    </h1>
</div>

<p>
Valora felt like she was in a haze. She was doing her best to drown out the surroundings, but it wasn't really working. Oh, it was easy not to focus on the work, and it was reasonably easy to drown out the staring crowd and the sound of violins, but she found it almost impossible to ignore the comments of the noble men and women who ordered her around. On the way down to the ball room, her body had been the topic of conversation, and Valora was now painfully aware that one of the gentlemen found her nipples “too pointy”, and that several of the ladies pitied her for her “tiny and unfeminine rump”.<br>
<br>
That wasn't even the worst part, though. She was sort of used to derision from noble men and women – such was society, after all – but then they had entered the ballroom, and she had been exposed not only to the guests, but also to her coworkers. The giggles and shocked gossip of her fellow servant-girls cut through the noise of the room like a knife, and she couldn't escape them or ignore them, no matter how she tried. At every turn she tried to shield her face from their eyes, so they at least wouldn't know it was Valora who was walking around the ballroom stark naked – if they found out, she would have to endure their ridicule forever for this. The only remedy was that she apparently wasn't alone in her misery.<br>
<br>
She knew this because she had overheard it. Shortly after they had entered the ballroom, the group had been approached by one Sir Koralo, who had told them of some noble Lady who apparently had all of her womanly features on shameless display. The ladies had gone to look, probably to mock the noble just as they had mocked the servant; Sir Aleksandro, however, said he had already seen her, and so he had stayed to torment Valora instead.<br>
<br>
“Servant girl!” she heard his voice ring out, and she snapped to attention, trying to shake away her thoughts. “I seem to have dropped my tie-pin. Would you be a dear and pick it up for me?”<br>
<br>
Valora shook with shame and rage. The tie-pin was on the floor just next to Sir Aleksandros' foot, and a large crowd of idle servants was standing nearby. It was easier for virtually anyone else to get it – but she had been given a direct order, and there was no way she could disobey. Slowly she walked over to the pin, trying to conceal her face with her hair as she bent down to pick it up, giving Sir Aleksandro a very good look at her “tiny and unfeminine rump”. She handed it to the gentleman, but he didn't take it.<br>
<br>
“Put it in my tie.” he commanded. He was quite tall, and to reach the tie she had to raise her arms so that she couldn't cover herself. She did so, standing before him, so close that she could smell his breath, and painstakingly adjusted his cravat until she could place the pin. All the while he just stood there, staring unabashedly at her breasts. She backed away quickly as soon as she finished.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Valora.” he said loudly, and Valora's heart caught in her throat. Immediately she heard the little throng of servants launch into whispered conversation, and she saw a sadistic smile spread across Aleksandro's face. He seemed to be extremely pleased as Valora's blush intensified to a tomato red, and she stared at her feet, trying to pretend she didn't exist.<br>
<br>
Well, now it was out. She would forevermore be the girl who had been naked in the ballroom on the biggest social gathering of the year. Within just a few days, everyone in the entire castle would be able to describe her body in intimate detail. It couldn't possibly get any worse than this.<br>
<br>
Just then, the music stopped. Everyone's eyes turned towards the stage: Someone was ringing a glass with a fork, and the room fell quiet. Even Sir Aleksandro's eyes were drawn away from Valora to gaze upon the redheaded woman who had taken the stage. She was dressed in a garish green dress, spun not from silk but from tough linen, supporting heavy golden baubles. She looked more like a highly decorated tree than a noblewoman, weighed down with expensive jewelry as she was. It was clear that nobody in the room recognized her – nobody except Valora, who gave a little gasp. It was Rubena! What was she doing on the stage?<br>
<br>
As the room fell silent, the woman spoke.<br>
<br>
“Ahem. I'd like to have your attention, please.” she said, with her strange sing-song accent, “The hostess is about to make some important announcements.”<br>
<br>
While the guests spoke to each other in confusion, trying to figure out who the strange gold-adorned woman could be, she stepped down from the stage. Striding up before the band was instead another woman, dressed in a long black cloak that was wrapped around her entire body. Valora squinted: It was Safira! She looked strangely different, however, and not only because of the outfit. A blush was on her cheeks, and she didn't at all have her usual air of confidence; in fact, she looked quite nervous.<br>
<br>
There was a long silence as she just stood there, facing the audience. Valora expected her to raise her hands or do some other dramatic gesture, as she was prone to – but she just stood there, drawing the cloak tighter around herself. It was as if she was afraid of something, which was peculiar. What could possibly scare the mighty Safira?<br>
<br>
“Um.” she began. “Ladies and gentlemen...”<br>
<br>
The hostess looked to the side. Valora followed her gaze; it seemed she was looking at Rubena. The latter nodded. What was going on?<br>
<br>
“Ladies and gentlemen, the reason I brought you all here... was to be witnesses to what I am about to proclaim. Let my words be heard in every corner of the kingdom. I...”<br>
<br>
She cleared her throat, and looked to the side again. “I... well, first of all, I acknowledge that I have been hoarding a great amount of wealth to myself. I have decided that taxes shall be lowered throughout the entire country, such as that they are fair and just to the common man.”<br>
<br>
There was a confused mumbling through the crowd. Many of the lower nobles looked quite happy, and a few broke into applause. Valora had forgotten about her nudity now, as had everyone else in the room: Little by little she was inching closer to Rubena, trying to catch a glimpse of what was going on.<br>
<br>
“Furthermore... Furthermore I have decided to give away some of my possessions to the poor.”<br>
<br>
Rubena snapped her fingers. It was quite subtle, but Valora managed to spot the gesture, and it had an odd effect on the sorceress – instantly, she let one of her arms drop to the side, and the cloak fell a little looser about her. Safira blinked and looked at once hateful, then fearful, and hurriedly spoke again:<br>
<br>
“I have decided to give away all my possessions to the poor.” she corrected herself. “My treasury shall be emptied, and the money therein spent on charitable projects to help those in need!”<br>
<br>
Now, the low nobles were applauding furiously. Many of the high nobility were displeased, though, and Valora could see Sir Koralo scratch his chin, clearly puzzled with the situation.<br>
<br>
“As for my servants and slaves, they shall be considered freed from service, except those-”<br>
<br>
Rubena snapped her fingers again, and Safira's other arm fell to her side. The cloak fell open a little, to reveal that whatever she wore underneath it must have quite a generous cleavage: Her neck and collarbones were plainly visible, and the cloth parted almost all the way down to her navel.<br>
<br>
“Er, with no exceptions.” Safira corrected herself. “They shall be given due payment and will continue serving in my castle only if they wish to.”<br>
<br>
Safira once more looked at Rubena. The red-haired girl was mouthing something.<br>
<br>
“My castle?” Safira repeated, loud enough that the room at large could hear it. “Certainly you don't mean... This castle has been in my family for generations! I don't-”<br>
<br>
Rubena snapped her fingers a third time, and the reaction in Safira was so quick it was almost automatic. She raised her arms, dramatically casting off the cloak. A shocked gasp rang across the entire room, and then the room fell absolutely quiet. Everyone, from the lowliest servant to the most exalted nobleman, was staring in disbelief at the sorceress.<br>
<br>
She stood on the stage before all her guests, in the nude! The only thing she wore was a pair of purple anklets, held together with a little chain. Her pale skin and rosy cheeks made her look like a porcelain doll, except that no porcelain doll ever had such anatomical correctness: Her breasts heaved up and down with her panicked breathing, blushing as rosy-red as her cheeks, and the gentle curve of her stomach met her smooth, shapely thighs in a little triangle that was almost entirely bare, only a thin black line of hair trailing across her pubic mound.<br>
<br>
The expression on her face could also belong on a doll: Her already large eyes were wide-open, her rosy mouth was pouting, and she looked like she was about to break into childish tears. She seemed as stunned as her audience, and not a word could escape her lips. She just stood there, naked, dazed, and confused, exposed to the wide-eyed stares of her guests and servants.<br>
<br>
The first one to break the silence was Rubena. She stepped up on the stage once more, standing next to the bare sorceress, and turned to the audience.<br>
<br>
“What Safira means to say, is that she intends to give up the castle as well. When she said all her possessions, she really meant all of them. Even this cloak,” she paused to pick it up, “shall be given to a charitable purpose. Take this to Lady Rozabela!” she shouted, throwing the cloak to a nearby servant. Safira looked as it flew through the air, and seemed to snap out of her shock.<br>
<br>
“No! I don't-”<br>
<br>
Rubena snapped her fingers once more. Abruptly, Safira sank to her knees, spreading her legs. Quite a lot more of her became visible now, as the blushing lips of her sex were laid bare for everyone in the audience, no longer concealed by her thighs.<br>
<br>
“What did you say, noble Safira?”<br>
<br>
“I don't- I don't-” Safira looked about in panic, and Rubena raised her hand as if about to snap her fingers once more.<br>
<br>
“I don't want any material possessions.” Safira finished, swallowing. “Even the cloak, like she said, will be given away.”<br>
<br>
“I object!” came a voice from the crowd. It was Sir Aleksandro. He was striding through the room, parting the crowd before him. “Clearly, the Lady Safira isn't acting of her own free will! There must be some trickery afoot!”<br>
<br>
“Are you suggesting, Sir Aleksandro, that Lady Safira could possibly be defeated?” Rubena retorted, with a threatening note in her voice. “Are you questioning her authority?”<br>
<br>
“Um, of course not! I just... Well, maybe...”<br>
<br>
“What says the Lady herself?”<br>
<br>
Rubena looked towards the kneeling Safira, who was quivering, quite possibly with fear. She was sweating heavily and didn't look very focused, but she responded nonetheless, speaking quickly and with an unsteady voice:<br>
<br>
“N- Nonsense, Sir Aleksandro! Nonsense! Do not... question me!”<br>
<br>
“But... My Lady! Surely you don't-”<br>
<br>
“I'm warning you!” Safira shouted, her voice breaking into almost a squeak, and Aleksandro darted back. Had he been in his own manor, he would have surely called for guards, but here in Safira's castle he was powerless. In here, the sorceresses word was law, and there was nothing that could trump it. Even if there had been, one could be pretty certain that no soldier or servant of Safira would willingly save her from this predicament: She ruled through fear, and right now she wasn't particularly menacing.<br>
<br>
“I'm... giving away everything. Including the castle.”<br>
<br>
“What of your lands? Your crown? Who shall rule in your stead? Surely you must see this is most unwise, my Lady!”<br>
<br>
Here, the strange red-haired woman intervened. She stepped in front of Safira so that she was momentarily shielded from the hungry eyes of the crowd – and from the roaming eyes of Sir Aleksandro, who seemed to have trouble keeping eye contact even as they argued.<br>
<br>
“Where I come from, we have a practice.” she said simply to the crowd. “Our kings are elected from among those of noble birth. It is a good practice. Let the one chosen by the majority rule in Safira's stead!”<br>
<br>
She did not expect the response to come so quickly, but it did. Somewhere, someone in the crowd began to chant a name, and it spread through the audience like a wildfire: “Vilhelmo! Vilhelmo!”<br>
<br>
Frieda-Rubena blinked in surprise. Evidently this Vilhelmo really was as kind and wise as she had thought. Well then.<br>
<br>
“It is decided! Safira shall abdicate, and Vilhelmo shall be the ruler!”<br>
<br>
“What? Vilhelmo?” came the sorceresses voice. “He is soft-hearted and weak! Choose Koralo, or Aleksandro!”<br>
<br>
The red-haired woman turned around to Safira, a look of disdain upon her eyes. She shook her head.<br>
“You really ought to know better, Safira.”<br>
<br>
With those words, she turned again to the audience, and raised her voice.<br>
<br>
“Ladies and gentlemen, you have made your choice! Now make another one, gentle guests! Safira has abdicated: She is now little more than a common wench. Is it not right, that she should please the guests in Vilhelmo's castle?”<br>
<br>
The crowd roared out its approval.<br>
<br>
Safira shook her head. “No, no, I didn't mean- I accept Vilhelmo as ruler! I accept!” she shouted in panic. “I accept! I accept!”<br>
<br>
“Too late, Safira. Thanks for the gold. Remember: From this day forth, you must never use magic to bring harm or shame to anyone.”<br>
<br>
With that, Rubena turned around, and snapped her fingers. As she walked away from the stage, a look of panic came over Safiras' face. Valora stared in amazement at what happened next:<br>
<br>
The sorceresses' fingertips settled on her thighs and began to glide up them enticingly. She squirmed, as if trying to escape from her own hands, but it was fruitless – soon one of them stroked the inside of her thigh, while the other one traveled up her body to fondle her breast, first softly, then squeezing it. Before long, her other hand joined it, and she kneaded her breasts, the look of panic gradually being overcome by one of pleasure. Her mouth fell open, and her eyes became half-shut as one of her hands glided downwards again, playfully circling around her bellybutton, and then continuing further down.<br>
<br>
She gasped at first, and then an actual moan escaped her. Here was Safira the sorceress, feared and famous in the entire world, and she was playing with herself before an audience of hundreds! Her hand moved rhythmically up and down as she rocked slightly back and forth, letting her other hand roam freely across her body as it pleased. The thief had not instructed her to enjoy it, but she couldn't help herself: Shame and humiliation slowly transformed into pure, unadulterated lust. She cooed with pleasure as she touched her nipples, and inhaled sharply as her left hand softly stroked her neck. Soon, though, her motions became more violent, and her hand shot up into her hair, grabbing it, tossing it, throwing it about so that it fell all over her face.<br>
<br>
Her hips were rolling along with the rhythm of her hand, now, and she spread her legs even further, standing straighter on quivering knees, making sure she hid none of her secrets from the astonished audience. She bit her lip, trying not to shout out her pleasure, but it only worked for so long.<br>
<br>
She confessed her surrender then, screamed it, gasped it, moaned it, until everyone in the room knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this was what she wanted – what she had always wanted. The spoiled sorceress had finally met with the punishment she deserved, and she enjoyed it passionately.<br>
<br>
By the time it was over, her entire body quivering with exhaustion and humiliation, the red-haired stranger was long gone, carrying enough gold to last her a lifetime.

<p>
It took some time before anyone could figure out who the strange woman with the red hair had been. It wasn't until someone asked the gate guards that the truth surfaced: The castle had been infiltrated by Frieda the Northerner, who had somehow defeated Safira in a witches' duel and forced her to abdicate. Exactly how she had managed to do this was never discovered: Safira refused to tell anyone, or maybe she was under orders not to.<br>
<br>
People had feared the ex-sorceress at first, but it fairly soon became clear that she couldn't use her magic to re-establish dominance: Somehow her spells always failed when they targeted another person, and Lord Vilhelmo had called her bluff when she tried to intimidate him. He let her stay at the castle as a token of goodwill, and was gracious enough to lend her decent clothing. Of course, once it came out among the staff that their tormentor had lost her powers, she was not always safe from harassment despite Vilhelmo's good intent.<br>
<br>
So it was that Safira, the once-great sorceress, found herself cornered in the corridors.<br>
<br>
“Well, well, well. Look who we have here, girls.”<br>
<br>
“Shaila! My dearest Shaila, what is the meaning of this? Haven't I always treated you well?”<br>
<br>
“Treated me well? You let me off the hook once or twice, sure, but you always were a sadistic bitch, even to me. It's payback time.”<br>
<br>
“Please, Shaila... I have faced my punishment. You do not have to do this, girl!”<br>
<br>
“Don't you girl me. Get her!”<br>
<br>
A throng of white-clad women swarmed forwards, pinning down the sorceress. Physically she was quite weak, and no match for the servant girls whose muscles had been hardened by polishing silver and cleaning laundry. She was held up against the wall by two of them as Shaila approached.<br>
<br>
“You never let us wear any underwear. Why should we allow you that luxury?”<br>
<br>
“But- Lord Vilhelmo has changed that policy! You can wear whatever you- Don't! No!”<br>
<br>
Safira screamed as her panties were tugged down to around her ankles, and struggled against the women who held her, but it was fruitless. They laughed cruelly as they tore at her clothes, and it was evident they would not stop at her undergarments. Soon, they had tugged her dress over her head, and pulled mercilessly at her bra until it snapped off her. Within moments, she was naked. She ceased to fight against them, realizing she didn't stand a chance.<br>
<br>
“Enough!”<br>
<br>
A voice rang out through the hallway, causing Shaila to turn on the spot. Striding down the corridor was a short, raven-haired girl in a servants' dress.<br>
<br>
“Valora? What are you doing here?”<br>
<br>
“What are you doing to Safira? You know fully well that since she abdicated, she has only done good! She's a better person now, Shaila. But then, it's always been like you to pick on anyone who's weak and vulnerable.”<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah? And what are you gonna do about it, huh? You feel like joining her? Girls!”<br>
<br>
The throng of girls let go of Safira, advancing menacingly on the newcomer instead. Valora cleared her throat. “Guards!”<br>
<br>
Instantly, the corridor filled with the heavy trampling of boots. Six armed men, heavily built, filed into the room. The advancing servant-girls stopped dead in their tracks.<br>
<br>
“Wh- what's the meaning of this?” asked Shaila, perplexed.<br>
<br>
“Didn't you hear?” Valora retorted. “Vilhelmo has made me head maid. The red-haired stranger recommended me in a letter. That means I outrank the guards... and you. Harassing the Lords' sorceress... he won't take kindly to that.”<br>
<br>
“C- Come on, Valora, you won't report me, will you?”<br>
<br>
“That depends.”<br>
<br>
“On what?”<br>
<br>
“On how willing you are to run five laps around the castle... in the buff.”<br>
<br>
Shaila swore. The guards, who apparently did not mind Valora's idea, took a few steps forwards. A look of fear spread on the tall brunette's face. “I'll do it!” she said quickly.<br>
<br>
“Good. Well, what are you waiting for?”<br>
<br>
Reluctantly, Shaila pulled her white dress up above her head, throwing it aside. She shot a murderous glance at Valora, before she untied the bra which had been her privilege for less than a week. It dropped to her feet, revealing her large, shapely breasts. Finally, cheeks burning with shame and rage, she hooked her thumbs in the waistband of her panties, and slid them down to around her ankles. She kept one arm in front of her body, covering her groin and one of her nipples, but the other was plainly visible to Valora as well as the guards, and it was clear they liked what they saw.<br>
<br>
“I didn't say you had to strip naked here and now, Shaila, but if you're so eager, go ahead.” Valora smiled, collecting her clothes. “You'll get these back on your return. Gentlemen, please keep an eye on her to make sure she completes all five laps.”<br>
<br>
Shaila swore again, and still covering herself, ran off through the corridor. The guards followed her eagerly, and so did the throng of girls. Within moments, the hallway had cleared out, only two people remaining.<br>
<br>
“Were they mean to you?”<br>
<br>
Safira nodded.<br>
<br>
“I know how horrible they can be. C'mere, I'll make it all better. You don't have to be afraid.” Valora beckoned the nude sorceress closer. “I'll make sure they never try anything like that again. Don't worry. And... you shouldn't be ashamed.”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“You're beautiful, Safira. Even more beautiful now than you ever were in fine silks and precious jewels. You used to be a goddess, cold and impersonal. Now, you are a woman. A very beautiful woman.”<br>
<br>
“You really think so?”<br>
<br>
“I really, really do. Come on, Safira. I have some spare clothes in my room. Let's get you dressed.”<br>
<br>
The servant-girl smiled, stretching out her hand, and the naked sorceress took it, squeezing it tightly. Their eyes met, and there was the slightest hint of electricity in the air. Both of them blushed inadvertently.  Holding hands, they walked out of the hallway, leaving their old lives behind. No longer a sovereign and a servant-girl: From this day forth, they would simply be Safira and Valora.<br>
<br>
And they lived happily ever after.
