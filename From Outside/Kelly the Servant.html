<h2>Kelly The Servant</h2>
<p><b>A week after Zoe’s week in the program.</b></p>

<p>In the evening, of March during Supper, Zoe, Tracy, Kelly, and Nicole had sat down to eat their supper, and as they did, Zoe began thinking once more about her week in the program, and she wondered, did her parents also take part in the program? The thought made her want to ask, so she looked up at her parents and spoke. “Hey ... I was thinking, and ... I wanted to ask ... Have you two spent time in the program?” She asked of them.</p>

<p>Kelly and Nicole glanced at each other and chuckled as a memory came to their minds. “Well, no, not exactly, see when your mother and I were your age, the program didn’t exist, but ... I spent time, for an entire week, naked though. But it wasn’t out in public, but at your Grandparents’ house. I mean grandparents from my side of the family, that is. How about we finish eating, and I’ll tell you about it, in the living room, ok?” Kelly asked, and the teens nodded their heads.</p>

<p>Although their supper was delicious, Tracy and Zoe’s quick consumption was fueled by their curiosity to hear the story. The girls were given time to locate their preferred spot on the living room couch. Zoe and Tracy sat together on the couch, with Zoe taking the comfiest seat. Kelly moved a leg rest to sit in front of her daughters, and Nicole sat beside her wife when their parents arrived.</p>

<p>“Well ... Here we go,” Kelly said with a chuckle before she regaled them with the story from her past.</p>

<p><b>Sunday in July Many Years Ago</b></p>

<p><b>Supper Time</b></p>

<p>As 16-year-old Kelly quietly consumed her typical supper, comprising white rice, and chicken. Her thoughts, however, strayed from her thoughts of how delicious her food was towards a different topic. Her very close friend Nicole had invited her to join her on a trip out of town to go to the world-famous Fun World.</p>

<p>A special contest victory gave Nicole two tickets, one for herself and one for a friend. Kelly was eagerly looking forward to going, especially since the ticket would be free for her. This was especially good because the Amusement Park’s tickets were an expensive expense that a Middle-class family could hardly afford. Consequently, she was forced to rely on others to cover her expenses, or to be fortunate enough to obtain coupons that reduced her costs.</p>

<p>Her eating slowed as she became lost in thought and eventually stopped. Her mother’s sudden call brought her back to the present, and she saw her family looking at her worriedly. “Sweetheart, is everything okay? You’re not eating,” her mother, Madelyn, reacted in place of the other members of her family.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mom! I was just thinking about Nicole. She invited me to Fun World next month, once she’s returned from visiting her grandmother. I ... I would honestly like to go with her...” Kelly said as she watched as her father, mother, and sister placed down their utensils. She knew what was coming next, and she mentally pushed her nervousness away so that she could focus.</p>

<p>See, Kelly’s family followed a unique tradition in which, rather than outright denying their daughters’ requests (such as going to Fun World), they allowed their daughters to demonstrate their desire to go by requiring them to perform additional tasks and make sacrifices.</p>

<p>Beginning the procedure, her mother responded, “Alright. What are a few errands and things you’ll do?” She inquired about her 16-year-old. Kelly opened her mouth to speak after taking a calming breath. Kelly decided to say “Everything,” which caused her family to blink their eyes in surprise. I’ll prepare the food, and-” She lacked the opportunity to proceed when her older sibling shouted. “ I object!”</p>

<p>Another thing the members of the family could do was object, but they had to have a good reason for it. “She nearly set the house on fire the last time she cooked!” Mara explained her objection, demonstrating that she was concerned about her safety. “Mara, your objection has been noted.” her mother acknowledged what Mara had said before returning to her youngest, “Although a lot of food can be prepared without cooking, this means Kelly, and you won’t be cooking. Is there anything else you’d like to add?” Her mother asked her youngest to whom she recalled wanting to add more, </p>

<p>Kelly nodded before taking a deep breath to settle herself before continuing. “I’ll do all the household chores, from mowing the lawn to washing the dishes, washing and cleaning.” The look of surprise on her family member’s face was amusing to the teenager.</p>

<p>They were taken aback by her decision, which indicated how much she wanted to visit Fun World with her friend. As soon as the idea came to her as a sort of test, her mother quickly grinned. “Okay, I’ll probably add another task to the list. We will also be washed by you.” She said only to hear that her big sister started talking loudly. “I object! I-,” but Mara couldn’t finish because their mother looked straight at her oldest. “Your objection has already been raised. You can’t have another!” She answered. Although Mara appeared dissatisfied, her mother was correct. Only one objection could be made by the teenagers.</p>

<p>“Dad!” Mara said, suddenly looking for him, as he hadn’t objected, so had one to give, but he remained silent. “Furthermore, you aren’t allowed to wash until everyone is washed.” Her mother said and waited for Kelly’s response.</p>

<p>While considering her mother’s addition to her list of chores, Kelly leaned in her seat. Unaware that this was a test and that she had the option of declining, Kelly said, “Okay,” causing her sister to gasp. She was aware that her mother’s extra addition forced her to touch her sister, mother, and father while they were each completely naked. It was a strange feeling, even though Kelly knew she would be using their loofah for the majority of it. She believed that by accepting the additional responsibilities and tasks, they would realize how much she wanted to take the trip.</p>

<p>She was also aware that her father had a job; he left at 8 p.m. and arrived home around 5 a.m. She would need to get up early to do it since her mother had told her that she couldn’t wash until she washed everyone. Kelly partly expected her father to protest as well, as he didn’t like it when his daughters were up past their bedtimes.</p>

<p>“We’ve spoken about what you’ll be doing. What are you giving up?” Her mother asked her sixteen-year-old. Kelly was aware that she could essentially deprive herself of watching television or reading books as a sacrifice. But since her friends were now away from the area, she was aware that those would be the only things she could give up, but young Kelly had an idea. When she wasn’t performing additional duties, her plan would allow her to watch TV and read.</p>

<p>She said, “Clothes,” causing her family to exclaim loudly in unison, “What?!” “I’ll give up my clothing ... I’m not going to wear clothes at all.” Kelly informed them and awaited her mother’s response to her decision.</p>

<p>Kelly had heard rumors of people who often went without clothing on, not only when washing or taking a bath, but during their everyday activities. She was attracted by it, but up until this point, she had never dared to ask for or granted permission.</p>

<p>“Okay ... So, while you’re undressed, you’ll clean up after us, do the laundry, mow the yard, water the grass, do the dishes, prepare supper, and vacuum?” When Kelly nodded in response to her mother’s question, the woman laughed. “Ok...” Then, she continued. “Now, before you start eating again, I think you need to change your attire because I believe that the period for your request shall start today and end at this time next Sunday.” Kelly was astonished by what her mother had mentioned, especially how short it would be.</p>

<p>Kelly believed that the length would have been considerably longer for something as expensive as Fun World. The girl was anxious, but she was certain that she could do a whole week of wearing nothing at all. She was shocked by her mother’s statement that she needed to change her clothes. She hadn’t yet realized that Sunday to Sunday at Supper required her to strip off before she could continue to eat.</p>

<p>When her parents left their nearly empty plates on the table and her sister got up and walked over to her, it snapped Kelly out of her thoughts. Mara stared at her bewildered younger sister and hesitantly said, “Arms up.” Kelly raised her arms, giving Mara the room she required to grab hold of her sister’s short sleeves and pull the shirt, revealing first her sister’s midriff and then her breasts, which were covered in a black bra. As Mara slipped her sister’s shirt completely off of her body, she got sight of her sister’s bra and her eyes blinked. Kelly slipped down her shorts and panties in a single motion after lowering her hands to place them at the sides of her shorts.</p>

<p>As she was doing this, Mara stepped around behind her and released the clasp on Kelly’s bra, allowing it to fall and eventually exposing her sister to the dining table. Kelly’s clothing were in a big box that her parents had brought back when Mara reached down to grab them. Kelly recognized several of her previous outfits. Mara walked to the restroom and threw Kelly’s clothing into the washing hamper rather than placing them in the box.</p>

<p>As her father sat down again, Kelly saw her mother carry the box containing her clothes into the basement. Mara quickly made her way back to her seat, followed by her mother, and they all resumed their meals as if nothing odd had happened. But to the teenager, sitting there nude in front of them felt a bit strange.</p>

<p>Kelly had never been exposed to or sought out a nudist lifestyle because her parents weren’t or because they didn’t live that way. Kelly has only ever gone to the beach in swimsuits as a result of this. Some tan lines have started to show as a result. For instance, Kelly’s breasts, butt, and the region surrounding what others would consider her private areas were all white.</p>

<p>Kelly didn’t notice her family’s behavior since she pushed herself to concentrate on getting back to her supper. She missed her father’s attempts to avoid looking at her and her sister’s plainly worried expressions. However, her mother didn’t even appear to notice her daughter and wasn’t even looking at her.</p>

<p>As usual, their family dined in complete silence to allow them to concentrate on their food. One by one, they began to leave and set their plates beside the sink. Normally, Kelly recalled, her mother handled the dishes, but because she had added it to her list of tasks, Kelly would now be in charge of doing them.</p>

<p>The naked teenager completed her meal and went to the kitchen with her plate and glass, while thinking timing her father’s departure since cleaning him was now part of her responsibilities. She was determined to complete, the dishes before she had to wash him. That’s when she immediately realized that she needed to mentally prepare herself for the impending sight of a nude man. As she turned on the tap and filled one basin with hot water and the other with cold water, Kelly quieted her mind and focused on her thoughts.</p>

<p>She started washing the dishes by soaking them, scrubbing the food off of them with the dish soap in the hot water, and then running them through the cooler water. Finally, she put the plates on the drying rack.</p>

<p>She then dealt with the cutlery they were using, particularly her spoon because it was the most useful item. Before putting them in the rack, she made sure they were as shining as if they had just been purchased, and all of a sudden she had a thought. of bringing her spoon far too close to her intimate areas than was necessary.</p>

<p>She forced her immature ideas out of her head since she knew doing otherwise would increase her workload. She realized at that point that she had made the proper choice not to carry out her intended course of action when she saw her mother and sister were watching her. Kelly grinned so boldly, as if daring them to comment on her dishwashing abilities.</p>

<p>But they were silent, her sister and mother watched like voyeurs as they observed. Kelly came to the realization that she didn’t mind being observed while she worked on the drinking glasses. She actually enjoyed it. The youngster was conscious of her tendency toward display, but questioned whether it was her lack of clothing or the fact that she was doing something unexpected, like cleaning dishes. She made the decision to worry about it one day and concentrate on her job right now.</p>

<p>She heard her mother remark, “You’re doing a great job, honey!” And she heard her sister add, “Yeah, that’s a good idea of using that thing too,” and she turned to look at the sponge-covered wand tool she was using. She turned to face the back entrance as the window next to it closed behind her. This gave her the opportunity to notice that her sister shut the windows before her mother proceeded to the one over the sink and held out her hand as if she were checking to see whether her daughter, who was naked, was being exposed to the chilly air.</p>

<p>Kelly knew that her mother and sister did not want her to be chilly, despite the fact that they appeared unconcerned and allowed her to be nude. But when her mother examined the air streaming in from the still-open window, she unintentionally stroked one of Kelly’s breasts with the back of her right palm. Her mother grinned at her daughter and said, “Sorry honey!” before passing her a dish towel. This would be used to complete drying the items she had left on the rack.</p>

<p>Kelly couldn’t help but reflect on how well she had done so far and how she will soon be allowed to join her friend in Fun World. But now that her mother had forced her to wash her family members as well, she was aware that there were challenges and things she would need to observe. She quickly went on to putting the dishes, glasses, and utensils away after seeing that they were now dry, which brought her back to reality.</p>

<p>Then she organized the cutlery, then the glasses, before grabbing a step stool and bringing it over to use to get the plates to their location in the cabinet. “Ah, you seem to have finished, and so promptly! Please proceed as your father needs to prepare.” Her mother replied, nudging her daughter gently in the direction of her father, who was leaving for the bathroom.</p>

<p>She accompanied him as he made his way to the restroom, but she let him use the toilet first. She headed straight for the bathtub as her father focused on taking off his clothes. She reached for the body wash bottle and set it on the loofah’s sponge before moving quickly to the shower hose, which was located next to the tub’s faucet.</p>

<p>Prior to turning on the water, Kelly made certain she had the hose and was holding the shower head. She didn’t want hot water, which would have been worse, to suddenly splash her. She took control of the shower, turned on the water, and set it up for her father. Because their household wasn’t a nudist one, she made an effort to avoid observing her father when he undressed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she caught a sight of his penis as he neared her and the tub. She started to think about why it didn’t arouse her after seeing that it did. Her thoughts finally led her to the conclusion that it wasn’t arousing her since it belonged to her father and she wasn’t attracted to him sexually. She pushed it aside because she had a strange belief that since it was a part of his body, her sentiments must also extend there.</p>

<p>Kelly saw him enter the tub with her and said, “Okay Daddy ... let’s get this done.” She gave him the shower head hose to hold before starting to go around him and coat him with soap as she went, making sure to get under his armpits and leg pits. She exchanged the loofah with the shower head hose once her father had been soaped up.</p>

<p>When his daughter got close to his privates, her father pulled his penis to the side so that she could use water to wash the soap out of his leg pits. He then left the loofah aside to dry while she rinsed the soap off his body. Before turning around to turn the water off, she maneuvered around him one more to make sure she had removed the soap.</p>

<p>Her father left the tub and dried off. He added, “Thanks, princess, for washing me,” and as she gazed at him, she had the instinctive impression that he believed she would take care of him if something were to happen during his retirement. She acknowledged that since she loved her father, the statement was true. He was a decent man and, in contrast to some, a wise one.</p>

<p>She climbed out of the bathtub with a brighter smile on her face and dried her feet and any water sprayed on her. She would now need to wash either her mother or sister because she had already cleaned her father. The teenager noticed how dark it was outside as she walked out of the bathroom and cast a quick check out the window. She was aware that she wouldn’t be able to trim the lawn, water the garden, or do anything outdoors now.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, her sister stood in front of her. “Let’s go in because I need to wash.” Mara said as she led the way back to the bathroom while affectionately cuddling her nude sister with one arm. Kelly entered the tub once again and prepared everything for her sister. Kelly made an effort to avoid looking as Mara stripped nude because she was her sister and she had done it before when they were younger, but she knew she would soon see her naked.</p>

<p>“Wait! I haven’t washed Mom yet. She said that I should do it before I get cleaned up,” Kelly said while she was attempting to take a step back, but Mara wasn’t so willing to let her go. “She claimed you must first wash everyone before washing yourself. Mom mentioned nothing about me cleaning you, so I’m cleaning you. Besides that, I wanted to show you some kindness.” Mara remarked while grinning.</p>

<p>Kelly dropped her arms while blushing, allowing Mara to completely lather her with the body wash. Kelly then watched as the soap dripped away from her while her arms were resting. She saw the perspiration from the day evaporating off her, noting that it would be apparent but not of worry to her. Mara finished with her, and the two exited the bathroom after drying off one another in the tub.</p>

<p>Sadly, her mother saw them and saw that Kelly was cleaner than when she had entered. “I thought I said you must first wash me before you can wash yourself.” Prior to speaking, Mara moved in front of Kelly. “You did, but you left out the part where I couldn’t wash her.” Her mother tried to respond, but she was unable to do so since her daughter was correct. Shaking her head, she sat down on the couch to watch her show.</p>

<p>Mara returned to her room after that. To watch alongside her mother, Kelly shifted to the opposite couch in the living room. Around 8:30, when the show they were viewing concluded, Kelly’s mother led her to the bathroom so she could do her final task for the day. Her mother advised her to get to bed immediately since she would need to wake up quite early when her father got home. She also needed to get used to sleeping nude; she had no idea that Kelly had done so already.</p>

<p>Washing her mother was similar to washing her sister, but since she had given birth twice, the body type was slightly different. Kelly, though, gave it her best effort before going to bed and sleeping.</p>

<p><b>Monday</b></p>

<p><b>3:00 AM</b></p>

<p>A brilliant light suddenly illuminated Kelly’s room, as if she had just closed her eyes. She observed that this light was coming from the hallway when she awoke more fully. Her room, her parent’s room, and her sister’s room were all connected to the rest of the home via the hallway, which also led to the bathroom. Additionally, she would typically keep her door closed while her father was at work because she anticipated that when the light turned on, her father would be home and the light would awaken her. However, this time it was on purpose because her dad didn’t object and she had to get up to wash him.</p>

<p>She yawned and stood up before leaving her room. She must have been quite the sight with her severe bedhead hairdo. Being surprised by both the fact that she was awake and the state of her hair, her father leapt when he noticed her as he was making his way to the restroom. It was also at this point that he understood his own error. He hadn’t raised an objection when she had to get up so early as part of her duties.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she had some rest as her mother had forced her to go to bed at 8:30. Kelly’s father could tell by the yawn, the untidy hair, and the sleepy eyes that she wasn’t a morning person. He wasn’t sure if Kelly would be able to wash him without falling over because she appeared to be getting ready to fall asleep. He led her in carefully and placed her on the toilet before washing and changing into his pajamas.</p>

<p>After finishing that, he noticed that she had fallen asleep, so he lifted her up and took her back to her room, where he laid her in bed, drew a blanket over her, and gave her a kiss on the forehead before going to bed.</p>

<p>Kelly discovered two things when she awoke five hours later: it was Monday, and it was eight in the morning. She couldn’t recall if she washed her dad when he came, so this was unexpected. But she believed she had since her doors were open. Kelly yawned as she got out of bed for the second time, but this time, she went directly to the kitchen instead of the bathroom. She turned her attention to her mother and sisters’ favorite breakfasts and remarked to herself, “Let’s see...”</p>

<p>Kelly grabbed the package of waffles and placed the waffles she had taken out of the package into the toaster, pressing down on the lever to start toasting the waffles. She then went to the fridge and, while attempting to ignore the cool temperature a second time, though at a lower degree, she grabbed the milk bottle and noted its level of emptiness as she brought it to the counter. She snatched the glasses and proceeded to fill them with milk from the soon-to-be-empty milk jug while she warmed the cups in the microwave.</p>

<p>After Kelly had emptied the milk jug, she filled it with water and then poured it out. She then crouched down and unlocked the door of the tiny trash can that was beneath the sink. When she opened the top, she saw that the garbage was full. She drew the sides up and knotted the bag together before lifting the garbage bag. She then carefully grabbed the empty milk jug and took them to the front doors.</p>

<p>Kelly was certain that her parents would have taken the garbage if she had left it there, but as she had previously stated, she would handle all of the cleaning, and she considered taking out the trash to be part of cleaning.</p>

<p>To free up her hands and make sure the door wouldn’t lock behind her, Kelly placed the garbage bag on the ground. After getting the garbage out, she went outside, emerging for the first time as a real exhibitionist. Before heading to the city’s big plastic garbage can, Kelly paused to inhale the fresh morning air and take a minute to look about. She maneuvered the trash bag she was carrying around to where the milk jug was under her left arm so she could remove the lid and throw the garbage inside before turning and walking back to the entrance.</p>

<p>When Kelly arrived, the microwave was beeping, signaling that the milk was ready. Kelly ran to the kitchen to get the milk, and she placed the jam on the waffles, before she noticed her mother and sister arriving. The naked teenager set the waffles down and then bathed her mother and sister who had just arrived. However, she refrained from washing herself since she wanted to attend to her outside obligations first.</p>

<p>Kelly’s mother called out, forcing her to look up, “Oh, Kelly, there’s an extra job I need you to do.” “Oh?”’ Kelly asked, as her mother and sister turned to face her and her mother pointed to the seed package. “I want you to plant those seeds. You have them marked out,” she informed the teenager.</p>

<p>Kelly’s mother wanted her to get some gardening experience, but she was unaware of this. She believed that this moment was her ideal chance. “Mara, don’t forget about your guitar lessons and swimming practice. Get ready because I’ll drive you there.” her mother reminded her big sister. As her mother and sister were soon gone, and her father was all asleep, Kelly realized she was all alone.</p>

<p>As she did yesterday, Kelly brought their plates and glasses to the kitchen and started washing and drying them. She hugged her mother and sister with one last embrace before remembering they had finished the milk. “Hey, Mom, there’s no more milk!” Her mother wrote it down on her list after Kelly said it. Her mother praised her youngest, “Thanks, sweetie!” as she and her eldest daughter left the house.</p>

<p>Prior to putting the dishes away, Kelly finished washing and drying them and rubbed a spotty itch that was dangerously close to her privates. Although Kelly hadn’t planned to or even came near to masturbating, her touch had caused some pleasure to rise in her body. She made an effort to pay attention to her new task, which was gardening.</p>

<p>The image on the side of the seed package revealed to Kelly that the seeds her mother wanted her to plant were strawberry seeds, so she picked up the seed packet. The eager teen snatched the package and strode out the back door, having made up her mind to hurry up now. Even though being in the backyard wasn’t exactly like being in the front, she was still experiencing the same emotions. The teenager experienced a really pleasant morning, but she was aware that she had to get to work.</p>

<p>As Kelly noticed the vacant space in the garden, she thought to herself, “I think that’s the spot there.” She walked up to it and bent down to poke holes in the soil and fertilizer. She had a plan in mind. She recalled a tidbit about a certain fertilizer element as she continued. “Manure ... Sure, that’s a joke. I wonder if just animal waste can be used for that, or if human crap can also be transformed into that. I’ll ask Mom later. I might be able to assist her with this. After all, that’s a chore as well,” Kelly added as she carefully inserted the split seeds into the holes she had created.</p>

<p>To determine how many more seeds she needed to plant, Kelly would frequently check the status of the seeds in the packet. She was persistent and discovered that she like this aspect of gardening and how simple it appeared.</p>

<p>She realized she had been distracted by washing her mother and sister as she continued to work because she started to feel the urge to use the restroom, something she generally does after breakfast. This presented the girl with a choice: she could either crouch there, spread her legs, and urinate where perhaps her father could see should he need to get a drink or something before going back to bed, or she could go in private. Or she could just walk inside the house to the bathroom and do it, but she hesitated to do so out of fear of waking her father up.</p>

<p>Kelly finally found a solution and set her seed packet down to rest on the wood before getting up and walking over to the shed, where she concealed herself so her father couldn’t see her. The famous yellow liquid started pouring as she knelt down and spread her legs as much as she could.</p>

<p>She was confident that her father couldn’t see her, but she had neglected to consider if anybody else may be able to. She jumped a little when she heard “Hiya!” and searched the area for the speaker. “I’m up here.” Kelly turned to face the voice and saw her neighbor’s son. The boy said, “I’m Timmy!” Kelly sighed. “I know who you are, Timmy. We’re in the same class,” she said, sounding a little irritated.</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah!” Timmy said while peering down at her from the tree he had scaled. “Your hair is messy!” Timmy remarked, observing her. She said, “Yeah, because I didn’t brush it.” Timmy stared at her closely and said, “Oh.” Kelly remarked, “You should probably get down; you might fall.” “Okay, have fun with peeing!” Kelly gasped in shock as she realized he could see not just her face but her entire body as well. She felt herself flush with humiliation.</p>

<p>“Never ever tell anyone what you’ve seen!” Kelly replied as she called to her classmate because the last thing she needed was for her entire class to find out what she had been up to over the summer and for whispers to start spreading around. Of course, she’ll tell Nicole since she anticipated that her friend would be interested in learning how she convinced her parents to say yes. The teenager returned to her job while sporting a flush on her cheeks as she gradually got over her humiliation. Once she realized the strawberry seed packet was no longer full, she carefully crossed the wooden planks dividing the garden’s numerous plants.</p>

<p>She believed that once she had finished planting, she could go grab the lawnmower and trim the grass. But she reasoned that since she would be spending more time in the sun, she should get sunburn-resistant lotion. She turned around and walked back to the house where she used the hose to wash her hands to get the dirt off her hands and then inside. The anti-burn cream is located in the drawer next to the refrigerator, Kelly recalled. She opened the drawer after moving there and discovered a brand-new container of the cream.</p>

<p>She grabbed the new bottle, opened it, and was just about to squeeze the lotion into her hands when her dad startled them both by walking up. “whoo!” Kelly had said, In answer “Goodness!” said her father. “You scared me; I wasn’t expecting that.” Kelly nodded. “You scared me, too!” Both of them paused to slow their breathing and heartbeats. Her father said after a while, “Smart, putting on the sunburn resistance,” as he noticed the bottle she was carrying. “Will you let me cover your back?” She responded with a nod, as she assumed she could use assistance with her back, given her inability to reach.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>He squirted some of the lotion on his hands when Kelly handed him the bottle, squirted some more on her hands, and then stepped behind her. She gasped at the coolness of the anti-burn lotion as he began to apply it to her back. Kelly quickly applied the lotion to her hands, arms, and any other exposed skin.</p>

<p>Before closing and putting the lotion bottle back in the drawer, her father made sure everything she couldn’t reach was covered with it. Her father wisely said, “Hey, since you’ve never used a lawn mower before, want me to show you?” “Sure! Yeah, that might be a good idea, but don’t you need to get some sleep?” As the two of them exited through the back door, Kelly questioned.</p>

<p>“Nah, don’t worry, this will be quick, and I’m one of those easy to fall asleep and easy to wake up.” As he moved the family’s lawn mower outside of the shed, her father said. When Kelly was younger, she had memories of sitting on the engine. She not only doubted whether it would be safe or allowed now that she was older, larger, and more mature. Kelly observed her father demonstrating how to start the lawnmower for her. “The bag will get torn, so make sure you’re off the pavement and that there are no rocks nearby, oh, speaking of the bag.” She watched as he quickly returned inside the shed to fetch the bag attachment and demonstrated how to connect it.</p>

<p>He moved the lawnmower and turned it on while Kelly watched, demonstrating for her what she needed to do. He yawned and turned off the lawn mower before making his way to the stairs leading inside the home. “Daddy, have a good sleep!” Kelly called after him before turning on the lawnmower and starting to mow the grass.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a good thing I requested this ... I had learned new things, some of which were obviously humiliating. But other things were new, and I believe I like being nude ... too bad there isn’t a profession where I can work while being naked hehe.” As Kelly pulled the lawnmower horizontally from the shed to the fence, she muttered to herself. When she reached the fence, she turned the lawnmower and went vertically up to the other fence, going away from the house and toward the garden. She made a turn at this point and continued to travel down towards the garden’s edge.</p>

<p>She moved back and rotated the lawn mower as soon as the wheels met the edge of the garden, allowing her to proceed horizontally once again. She moved up one as she operated the lawnmower and finished the circle, finally arriving in the center of the backyard as time went on.</p>

<p>She now deactivates the lawnmower and moves it in the direction of the front gate in an attempt to cut the front grass. She was aware that many people were most likely asleep in the morning, and she barely briefly exposed herself. But for now, there were more opportunities to be seen.</p>

<p>She released the lawnmower from her grasp as Kelly and it approached the gate. She was aware that before she could get the lawn mower on the other side, she would need to unlock the gate. After letting go of her grip, she stepped around the lawnmower to approach the gate, unlocked it, and then pushed the gate open further. After doing this, she turned to the lawnmower, flipped the handle’s side, and dragged it up to the gate before moving to the opposite side of it. She could more easily bring the lawnmower to the grass because her father’s truck was the only vehicle available while her mother had not yet returned.</p>

<p>“Alright, let’s restart,” Kelly thought to herself as she put the lawnmower back into action and started going in cautious lines like she had in the backyard. She moved along the fence that separated her family’s land from Timmy’s family’s property, starting at the edge of the driveway’s boundary and moving toward the home.</p>

<p>As she moved the lawnmower away from the fence’s edge, the grass cutter cast a quick peek at the homes across the street from her family’s residence. She could tell that at least some people were home because of the vehicles and vans, and they may be able to see her. She could see that some of those homes appeared to have open windows, which made it simpler for the blinds to sway in the little breeze. When Kelly took a minute to consider her feelings on the surroundings, she noticed that she felt warm but that there was a small wind in the air. If she had been clothed, she wondered whether or not she would have felt the gentle wind.</p>

<p>Kelly drew nearer to the center of her family’s front yard as the seconds passed. The teen continued to mow the grass until she noticed a vehicle approaching from behind. She immediately recognized it and the license plate as belonging to her mother. She could make out a passenger in the car and it appeared that her mother was driving home. The passenger seat belonged to her sister. Before her mother turned into the driveway, Kelly waved at them and watched as they waved back as the car got closer.</p>

<p>Kelly could put the lawnmower back in place since her mother didn’t park too far. Her mother and sister then got out of the car and approached their nude family member. “Almost done.” Kelly said to them, “Just need to do this little square, and then I’ll water it all,” Just as her mother went up to comb her daughter’s hair with a comb she had retrieved from her purse. “That sounds great, honey!” In response, her mother gave her daughter a big embrace. “Make sure to take a shower once you’re done, sweetheart. You have a faint odor, which may be caused by sweat.” Her mother replied without realizing that her daughter had not taken a single shower today.</p>

<p>Kelly’s mother had moved towards the front entrance of their home as she resumed cutting the last square of their front lawn. She ultimately completed mowing since she was so focused on her task; she then switched off the lawnmower and moved it toward the driveway. “Hey, sis, you are using the sun burn resistance lotion to prevent sunburn, right?” Mara moved from where she had been resting against the vehicle, observing her, and inquired as she walked up to her sister. Kelly nodded. “Yeah, once I planted the strawberries that mom requested in the garden, I made sure to get some on. And before teaching me how to use this, Dad helped me with my back.” Kelly spoke as she brought the lawnmower up to the gate.</p>

<p>Mara came forward to push the gate more open and held it as Kelly passed by, touching Kelly with her shorts at the side.</p>

<p>After spending the most of the day in the absence of clothing, she was experiencing unusual feelings as she came into contact with her sister’s clothes. Kelly was also reminded that she still needed to do the laundry, which she should do as soon as possible. She focused on returning the lawnmower to the storage shed for the time being. As she did, Kelly quickly realized that the water hose cap she would need to water the garden, trees, and the grass was also in the shed, but because she already made a promise to go wash, she chose to start there.</p>

<p>Before Kelly could react, she felt Mara gently pulling her back and out of the shed by catching hold of her arm. Mara urged her to go as she led the way to the the house. Kelly thought Mara wanted her to go wash as well. She didn’t mind, but she was aware that it will remove the sun burn resistance cream off, which meant she’d needed another application of the cream to prevent sunburn.</p>

<p>Mara moved quicker, catching Kelly’s attention, and she observed Mara approaching the door first and opening it. However, Kelly grinned at her and entered before Mara as she held it wide for her nude sister. Kelly laughed as Mara put her hands on her bare shoulders and pulled her to the bathroom. “To the bathroom with you, Missy,” Mara said. Kelly entered the bathroom first, Mara quickly followed, and Kelly then entered the bathtub. As Kelly lathered the loofah with soap, Mara grabbed the shower hose, switched it on, and made sure it was warm.</p>

<p>Kelly was stopped by Mara, who started washing her sister while making sure to get rid of any possible stains, such as perspiration and dirt. Once everything was finished, she seized the loofah and started soaping her sister. She reminded her sister to keep her hands at her side, which led Kelly to do so. Mara said, “Turn,” as she completed the front of her sister and the armpits and leg pits. Kelly already smelled much better to Mara than she had before.</p>

<p>Her older sister continued to work on washing Kelly with her back to Mara. “Good thing you didn’t request the complete servant experience, like those online stories.” Kelly heard Mara say to her back as she cleaned her, “I wouldn’t get to wash you like this.” Kelly responded with, “Yeah, I didn’t want to go too far. “However, I must confess that sleeping on the grass is an interesting idea.” Kelly told her, “But I didn’t want to do that. I couldn’t help but picture sleeping on the grass outside.” She said though she figured she would most likely get up as soon as the sun rose.</p>

<p>Eventually, she started thinking about her father and what his job would be like. She hadn’t been able to accompany him on work on Take Your Child to Work Day. Even now, she wasn’t sure it was possible to ask whether she may accompany him.</p>

<p>Before assisting her wet, nude sister to get out of the tub and onto the towel that was already on the floor, Mara shut off the water and put the loofah back in its place. She quickly seized a second towel and began drying her sister. “All you have to do now is water the plants and do the laundry, right?” Mara questioned her, and Kelly responded by nodding in agreement “Yup,” she said as she walked over to the bin where their soiled clothes were kept. She took a little break as she continued as she thought about their bedding. She might be able to wash those by taking them with the clothes. Her mind began to wander to the other things she still had to do, like watering the outdoor plants.</p>

<p>But as she was walking to the backyard, she caught sight of the clock. She would need to prepare food for her family because the clock indicated that it was already one o’clock. Laundry and plant watering could wait. She then made a U-turn and moved in that direction. Her mother called to her nudist daughter, “I’m craving hot dogs, honey,” “Ok,” she responded as she removed six hot dog wieners from the packet and placed them on the plate. However, she had taken two out and placed the remaining four in the microwave, setting it to the number her mother favored before placing her own and setting it to 22.</p>

<p>Kelly was picky about the temperature of her hot dog wiener. In contrast to the level that her mother and sister favored, 22 was ideal to her because the wieners didn’t wrinkle and it was simple to grip.</p>

<p>Kelly took the hot dog buns and put the weiners inside once she was done cooking them. That was it for her own, but she squirted some ketchup over her mother’s and sister’s hot dogs because she knew they would probably want it. The three began eating their meals in quiet once everything was brought to the dining room, where her mother and sister were waiting.</p>

<p>Kelly reflected on how she had already eaten three times while she was still unclothed. As far as Kelly was concerned, it was already an accomplishment. Since they were eating hot dogs, they finished up quite quickly, and Kelly swiftly cleaned everything up before moving on to her other duties.</p>

<p>The teenager left her mother and sister behind and walked to the back door, opened it, and then returned to the outdoors. She walked to the coiled hose, started uncoiling it, attached the proper head, and then turned the dial while remaining silent and thoughtful. Kelly was holding the end of the tube near to her face when this happened, almost spraying her.</p>

<p>Kelly started dragging the hose as she walked over to the garden. By leaving the water running, she also made part of the recently cut grass receive water, albeit most of it was in a line from where the hoses were kept wound up to where the garden was.</p>

<p>She reached the boundaries of the garden, gripped the hose, and carefully directed it to ensure she was spraying the plants just as she started to slightly sidestep so that more of the plants were watered. Kelly also saw to it that the hose was raised so that the plants at the back could be watered.</p>

<p>The teenager started working, watering the plants, but her attention started to wander. “I wonder ... What being a plant might be like.” She said, out what she was thinking. “If I were a plant, I’d probably be immobile and stuck in one place.” While looking in the direction of the tree, Kelly muttered to herself. “Trees live a long time, but there’s a good chance I’ll be chopped down if I’m in a forest. So that’s not going to be good,” she replied, gasping at the unsettling thought.</p>

<p>Kelly maintained her eyes on the task at hand, making sure to move the dial when she reached the spot where she had planted the strawberries so that the water pressure would get better there. She was aware that flooding the area would not aid in the development of the seeds into strawberries that could be harvested. She muttered to herself, “I think that’s enough water for them,” and changed the direction of the hose so that she was watering the grass rather than the garden plants.</p>

<p>As she moved near the backyard trees, the water burst out onto the grass. Her right foot had brushed against it as she moved, causing some of the water to flow down her foot and spray as it moved. She could also feel the moist grass beneath her feet, perhaps brought on by the water she was splashing.</p>

<p>The girl had a thought about a story she had read once as she got closer to the first tree to the east in her backyard. She had gone to the area behind the tree and walked closer to it before wrapping her arm around it and giving the tree a hug while holding the hose farther away from her body. Before she realized she still had work to do, she stayed in this posture for a few minutes while she absorbed the feelings she had and what the rough bark was doing to her.</p>

<p>She moved away and, in a sense, parted ways with the tree as a result of her thoughts as well as her developing fear about being seen hugging a tree. They moved the hand that was holding the hose closer. for the tree’s roots to be a way for the water. Kelly quickly moved on after remembering that leaves are also used by trees to absorb water. She immediately took water to the leaves. The naked teen was perplexed by how the autumn leaves fall. Do trees lose their mouths? She found the concept strange.</p>

<p>She walked away after watering the tree while also scratching an itch on her chest. She realized when she looked down and saw that she had items on her chest and much of her body in a line. She blushed in shame as a result, and she also moved the splashing water so that it flowed down her front, pushing the loose wet bark and loose tree material off.</p>

<p>Holding the hose, Kelly strolled across the freshly cut grass, dousing it with water as she went. She moved her arm to spread the water’s coverage over a larger patch of grass as she did this to water the lawn. She walked a line on the outer edges of the grass before moving in, just like she had done before mowing the lawn. She eventually became aware of her sister watching her as she moved. She halted and called out, “Hey, can you get me something to drink?” to her. Since she had been working outside and hadn’t had anything to drink in a while.</p>

<p>Kelly realized she should maybe drink more because she was feeling both hot and thirsty. Kelly observed Mara nod and run inside before emerging with a water bottle and her mother following behind with a bucket of water. Mara pointed to the bottle and said, “Here,” letting Kelly sip the water. The contents in the container shrank as it entered her mouth, getting smaller and smaller. She continued, which alarmed her sister based on the expression on her face.</p>

<p>Kelly closed her eyes in an effort to concentrate on her drinking and avoid being distracted. She was consuming an enormous amount of water, which would be really problematic. Since working on such a hot day without drinking might cause heatstroke. She gave back the bottle once she had done drinking it. “Thank you,” Kelly said, but Kelly gasped when Mara grabbed the hose from her sister because her mother and sister were concerned that she would suffer from heatstroke. They hit her with water from two different sources before. The hose was one, and the bucket was the other.</p>

<p>She screamed in shock when she felt the chilly water on her face. She felt it as water was poured over her from both ends; it cascaded over her shoulders, between her breasts, and eventually over her nipples and private parts. The same thing happened to her back and rear.</p>

<p>“That’s cold!” Kelly exclaimed as she gazed at her mother and sister. “Sorry honey,” her mother replied as she tenderly touched her daughter’s exposed shoulders. “We had to because we were worried you might get heatstroke.” Her sister said, “Goodness ... I’m almost done back here and just need the front, so I’ll let the heat dry me up.” said Kelly as she then retrieved the hose from her sister and returned to watering the lawn before going to where the hose was wound up and turning off the water.</p>

<p>Kelly moved her hands behind her ears and raised them to push her damp fair back. As she made her way back to the gate, this revealed her 36-b cup breasts to the outside world. Because of her motion and gravity, some of the water drops that were still on her body fell down her leg and toward the ground.</p>

<p>Kelly felt the water trickle down her legs and couldn’t help but picture some sort of bug moving down her leg. This idea made her feel uneasy; the teen was equally alarmed by the idea of an insect moving up her leg. and she was aware that certain insects need a moist, pungent environment in which to lay their eggs, and she was only aware of two locations on the human body that would partly work for that description.</p>

<p>Kelly said to herself, “Oh gosh.” She moved up to the gate, stepped forward, and opened it once more as she murmured to herself, “Ok, gotta focus.” Kelly thought the backyard was shaded, but she also thought her neighbors’ houses and the trees around contributed to this. Although the front yard was considerably brighter than the backyard, a tree at the front end provided a significant amount of shade for the street.</p>

<p>As she exited the gate and walked by her mother’s car and her father’s truck, both of which were shiny and glittering like her, the sun shined down on her. Naturally not, like the vampires in the Twilight series, though. As Kelly proceeded to where the coiled hose was in this location, her drenched figure caused the light to reflect on the water.</p>

<p>Before grabbing the hose and starting to uncoil it from its holder, Kelly took a moment to look around one more as she tempted fate to be seen by someone other than her family. She was aware that the front yard just required watering the grass and a tree, so she knew she didn’t need to be concerned about anything else. Additionally, she was aware that the hedge wall, rather than a fence, marked the end of the property line. She focused on the hose and switched it on, realizing that it was the neighbor’s job to water the hedge.</p>

<p>Before starting to move, Kelly took a minute to watch it shoot out of the hose and onto the lawn. She watered the leaves first, and then twisted the hose as she approached the tree to water the roots as well, which also made water fall on her.</p>

<p>She was aware that hugging this tree would result in her becoming dirty, much like hugging the trees in her backyard, and that it would also serve as a kind of blackmail against her since her sister would taunt her and, if there were any observers, anybody else. She being naked may, of course, serve as fuel for other individuals.</p>

<p>She soon finished watering, returned the hose to its holder to correctly coil it, turned off the water, and went inside. Since she was still wet, she instantly saw her sister and mother with towels, and they took proper care to dry her before she proceeded up the stairs.</p>

<p>Now dry, she walked straight to the hamper in the bathroom and carried it downstairs to the laundry room. There, she started sorting the clothes as she learned how to wash each item of clothing before placing it in the washing machine. She was aware that colorful clothing should be kept separate from white clothing, but her collection of white clothing was limited to a few pairs of pajamas and a pair of underwear. As her clothing entered the washing machine, Kelly immediately recognized them.</p>

<p>She pressed the necessary buttons and closed the lid of the washing machine with the dirty clothes that needed to be washed. “Alright ... A load of laundry is in progress. So I suppose all I have to do is use the vacuum cleaner while I wait.” As she turned and headed for the stairs, she thought to herself as she climbed them to reach the carpeted levels above.</p>

<p>She noticed the clock above the cable box in the living room and noticed it was 4 o’clock. This indicated to her that her father will be up shortly. This brought to mind her desire to change the bedding for everyone, which she could accomplish now that her father was up. Kelly turned and gave her mother a quick look. “I’m going to change the sheets and pillows, okay?” Her mother grinned at her as she said, “Thanks, honey.” She said as Kelly entered her sister’s room and started removing the blanket from its cover.</p>

<p>Mara moved to help her after noticing this. It took some effort to remove a blanket from a cover. Mara pulled the blanket behind her to make it easier for her sister, and then let it fall to the ground, where it was quickly followed by the pillowcase and bed sheet. The final three were a lot simpler to manage.</p>

<p>After mercilessly discarding the pile in the hallway, Kelly picked up the pile again and replaced it with fresh linen, a bedsheet, and a pillowcase. She couldn’t help but think about the House Elves from Harry Potter as she grasped the pillowcase. She pondered whether her mother could create a larger version so she could give it a go. Before she returned her attention to what she was doing, several elements to this peculiar attire came to mind.</p>

<p>After changing her sister’s bed, she went to her own room to change her own bed, then she left her room to go meet her mother in her parents’ room. “I felt like waking up your father. Do you want to go do it?” Kelly was questioned by her mother, and Kelly nodded. “Sure,” she said before she entered her parents’ bedroom.</p>

<p>Her father slept on the side closest to the windows, something she remembered from the past snuggling sessions with her parents when she was younger. These windows were shut to prevent the air from ruffling the blinds. But because of the shadow created by the light coming from the bottom portion of the blinds, she could see her father. The naked teenager turned around the queen-sized bed toward the windows, then gently shook her father’s side as she approached the end table where a bottle of water was kept in case her father woke up thirsty.</p>

<p>The pair of breasts in front of him belonged to an adolescent rather than an adult. “Daddy? You need to get up now.” As he got to his feet, Kelly’s voice addressed him and he talked to his daughter. “Good morning, afternoon, or evening, kiddo,” The teenager thought that her father was still getting acclimated to his work shift. Her father found himself briefly dazzled as she opened the shutters until he acclimated to the light. He eventually got out of bed and made his way to the door. When he noticed the pile in the hallway, he knew that his wife—or, more precisely, his daughter—was changing the sheets while she was naked.</p>

<p>She started replacing her parents’ bedclothes, pillowcases, and blanket cover as soon as her father got out of bed. They had already added more items to the pile by the time her father had done with the toilet, and she was taking them down to the washing basket. She left the bed linens next to the washing machine since the clothes weren’t completed washing when she went back to change the bedding.</p>

<p>Kelly noticed some stiffness as she worked, which just served to highlight how incredible her mother must be since she had completed all the tasks Kelly had completed over a longer period of time. She wondered how much suffering her mother had endured after doing this for so long. After assisting her father with his cleaning, she went to take a brief break by sitting down, but she knew she wouldn’t be able to do so for very long.</p>

<p>Kelly made a gentle attempt to rub her shoulder. “Sore, huh?” Her mother inquired, while displaying a hint of a smile. “Yeah...” Kelly responded to her mother while observing her, approach her nude daughter. She motioned for her daughter to turn, who did so without delay. Her mother then started massaging her.</p>

<p>As Kelly’s mother massaged her bare shoulders—moving the massage down to make sure she reached every muscle—Kelly sat there with her back to her. Kelly wanted to speak to her mother about what she had noticed, but the massage had kept her from doing so. After some time, her mother responded, “There, that should help, honey.”</p>

<p>Kelly murmured “Thanks Mom” before rising to prepare dinner. She removed the glass containers containing the food, then got up to retrieve the plates from the cabinet, placing the food on them before taking each dish one at a time to the microwave, where she set each plate to be heated at 150 degrees. Kelly pulled the vacuum cleaner out of the closet and plugged it in while she waited for the clock to strike five o’clock before dragging it to the bedrooms.</p>

<p>Kelly believed she could make it before dinner since she was aware of how long vacuuming took. She started by taking the vacuum cleaner to the bedrooms since she thought the scale of the importance. The bedrooms, therefore, received top importance. Before she finished her own, her parents and sister’s bedroom were the first.</p>

<p>Kelly considered the tasks she had completed so far this week while she vacuumed. This was by far the simplest in terms of tasks and comfort, according to the nudist adolescent. Washing her family members was the most uncomfortable, but the girl felt strangely accomplished, almost proud of herself. She recognized that caregivers have to carry out their duty for the patients they are responsible for.</p>

<p>Even the most difficult task had to be completed for the benefit of the patients, and the caretakers were unable to object or decline.</p>

<p>They were somewhat reliant on her, even though she was aware that her parents and sister weren’t patients. She also recalled the odd combination of superhero, princess, scientist, and Martian that she had dreamed of being when she was little. She wasn’t sure if she wanted to be a nudist caregiver, but at this point she wanted to be a doctor or at least a caretaker.</p>

<p>The family ate their meals when Kelly finished the vacuuming chore and brought everyone’s food to the table. They remained silent, as was customary for the family, but Kelly took advantage of this time to think more about what she should say to her family regarding the events of that week.</p>

<p>While doing the dishes and other chores, she kept pondering. As the days passed, Kelly continued to do the duties of a servant, making sure everything was tidy and the dust was cleared. But because she had finished the most of her responsibilities on Monday, the remainder of the week saw her remaining nude.</p>

<p>There was one night during the week when she had a dream that she believed actually occurred. She cleaned while accompanying her father to work while remaining completely nude.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until Sunday that she could finally get dressed.</p>

<p>As she sat down to dine, Kelly began to speak. “You know...” She told her family, “This week was ... Odd to be sure, but also revealing in concrete and abstract ways.” “I don’t believe that one of you two fully understands what mom does for us. I mean everything she does.” As her mother blushed, Kelly continued to speak. “I’m talking about doing the laundry, watering the yard, vacuuming, and cooking for us.” Her father chuckled. He hugged his wife and remarked, “For the record, I am aware of how amazing your mother is,” to his girls. “However, I do agree that she does a lot, and I appreciate her,” Kelly and Mara agreed as he concluded by nodding their heads.</p>

<p>“It also got me to thinking; I think that once I graduate from high school, I want to work as some sort of caretaker. Some caretakers take care of individuals who can’t handle some things, right? I’m not sure whether I want to be one of the nude ones, though. Kelly addressed her father with her question.</p>

<p>Her father gave a nod. “Indeed, there are those who look after infants and those who look after the elderly. And some who look after teenagers, like you two. If you truly want to work in caregiving, I can put you in touch with some of my connections. Who will be able to assist you, do you want that? His daughter responded by nodding when he asked. “Yes, please!” Kelly answered. Her parents were beaming with pride as they looked at their youngest daughter.</p>

<p>Even Mara was proud of her sister, though Mara kept her feelings to herself because this was her sister’s time to shine. But after the conversation, they resumed eating.</p>

<p><b>Years later</b></p>

<p>“So, wait, were you serious when you say that you served Poppops, Grandma Madelyn, and Aunt Mara for a full week while being completely naked?” Tracy questioned her mother Kelly while wearing a look of amazement and wonder. As she gave her wife an affectionate hug Nicole added, “I have to admit, she surprised me too when she told me.” Nicole also kissed her wife on the cheek. “How is Aunt Mara doing now?” Zoe questioned her parents. “Mara is doing well; she is currently working in Spain. She really enjoys travel, unlike your aunt Melody, who preferred to settle down and become a teacher.” Kelly answered; “In fact, I think I was given a letter from her that arrived yesterday.”</p>

<p>Zoe asked, “Mama Kelly, are you still a caregiver?” As soon as the thought occurred to Zoe.</p>

<p>Kelly gave a headshake. “No, my current role is more administrative; I sort of act as a liaison between Mara’s group and the hospital,” Kelly remarked as they were eating. “I think ... I might want to work with her, with Aunt Mara, I mean.” Nicole grinned as Tracy remarked, “Mara will be glad to hear that.” Kelly also smiled “I’m glad you think so, Tracy,” said Kelly before she continued, “Because Mara did want to invite you to come over for a special trip.”</p>

<p>“As for me, I don’t remember much so, sadly, I’ll have to get Melody to tell the story,” Nicole frowned and remarked, “Though as Mama Kelly had said, when we were your age, the naked in school program didn’t exist, but there was a week that I had spent naked in school.” Nicole said to her daughters.</p>

<h2>Dream Time!</h2>
<p>People are believed to exist in a different reality when they are asleep. It presented dreamers with a surreal universe where strange things happen at random. Scary things are often random and have nothing to do with the current situation, yet occasionally when someone wishes for home, their dreams torment them with visions of home even if they can’t yet travel there. However, some dreams are so vivid that they lead individuals to believe they have done something they while in reality they haven’t. Kelly dreamed about the latter during her week of slavery. These were the dreams that she remembered, but had decided not to share with her future family.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Nightmare</b></p>

<p>Kelly yawned and as she opened her eyes, she didn’t know something was unusual as she started waking up. She didn’t experience the comforting sensation of the blanket enveloping her or the sensation of air as she pushed herself out of bed. But as soon as she saw the time on the clock, she stood still. It was 4:50 PM, according to the clock. “Time to wake up!” her mother said as she appeared at her door before leaving.</p>

<p>Weirdly, Kelly didn’t think about it as she moved from the bed and headed for the bathroom. However, Mara, her sister, had already seized her shoulders and forced her nude sister into the dining room while arguing, “Time to eat,” as she did so. They expected Kelly to join them for supper, even though she didn’t remember having breakfast or lunch. Suppers were large dinners with a lot of food.</p>

<p>It was clear that her mother and sister didn’t want the unwashed teenager to go wash herself, so she sat down at the table with her hair in a messy hairstyle. She observed that her mother, sister, and father had already showered and dressed. She almost forgot the rule about waiting to wash until she’d washed everyone, though, because of how sleepy she was. It brought back to her mind the image of her family in that condition.</p>

<p>She let it go and focused on her meal since, for some reason, it didn’t disturb her. The food passed in front of the nude teenager and was incredibly light, almost like breakfast. Something light, and she saw that her father was eating the same thing. He would, of course, as he was going to work very soon, and it wasn’t advised to eat a lot when someone had just woken up. She became aware that something was wrong when she gave this a thought. Why, after all, would Kelly’s mother want to feed her so light a meal as well? She also questioned why she had gotten up at such a late hour.</p>

<p>She glanced up as her mother started talking, and her interest peaked. Despite being seated across from Kelly at the dinner table, she stated, “You’ll be going with your father,” with a voice that seemed distant. Kelly exclaimed, staring with astonishment, “I am?” “Yes,”</p>

<p>“Timmy is coming over, don’t want him to see,” her mother murmured in a distant voice, before she continued. Kelly had this idea when she suddenly realized her dish was gone. Kelly, however, showed little reaction to this, and seemed indifferent to her missing a meal. She did, however, peek up to see her sister and dad getting up. When Kelly got up to go to a bathroom to wash, her father stopped her. He replied, “You’ll be coming with me,” in a voice that sounded distant like her mother’s.</p>

<p>When she felt his grip on her arm, she looked up to find him dressed like a security guard. Kelly knew her father didn’t work security, but she didn’t question it. She overheard herself saying, “I need to go wash.” before “Why bother? In either case, you’ll be dirty.” Her mother remarked as her sister handed up a mirror showing Kelly’s face, which had patches of gooey jam on it. Kelly’s father pulled her again and forced her to walk towards the door, and finally out of the house.</p>

<p>Kelly noticed her heart beating quickly as she walked to her father’s truck because she was worried about being seen. She entered the truck once her father had unlocked the door and sat down on the seat. She didn’t enjoy sitting on it since it appeared to have some tears in it that had been taped up in other areas. As she climbed in, some of this tape that was coiled up snagged on her skin and pubic hair and tore at her body.</p>

<p>When she saw Timmy arrive, she hurriedly closed the door in an effort to keep him from noticing her. Nevertheless, despite her best efforts, the door only closed slowly. This gave Timmy a clear view of her, and as the truck moved out of the driveway and the nude teenager was taken for an unpleasant journey, she noticed his recognizable smirk.</p>

<p>She was familiar with the discomfort of the seat because she had sat in it on previous travels before to her dad’s current shift. But even so, she decided to tolerate it as her father drove her into the growing dusk of the evening streets. After some time, they came to a halt at a red light. Next to them, there was another, larger vehicle whose driver could look inside, so they knew she was naked. Before the light turned and they sped away from one another, the driver reached inside and haphazardly inserted a piece of gum onto her body.</p>

<p>Despite having seen this, for some reason, she had chosen to ignore it. But as everything was happening, she did turn to face the other truck driver. She was unable to see his face since it was hidden by the shadows and darkness of his cab. The vibration of her father’s truck as he drove away caused part of the jam on her face and the gum to slip off.</p>

<p>The road her father was traveling on had hazy colors, and she had noticed strange, misspelled text on the signboards that appeared to have been produced by an AI artist. She felt confusion and fear as she traveled with her father to work.</p>

<p>The anxiety was growing as a result of her shame at the prospect of soon being exposed in public areas far from her house. Even worse, she still hadn’t been able to wash or go back home. She was affected by how filthy she was. The dream went on because Kelly was not aware that it was still only a dream, but to her, the night went on.</p>

<p>They arrived at her father’s workplace after a brief delay, and she could still make out individuals. Additionally, their vehicles were present. She recalled her father telling her family that he was the lone truck driver at work.</p>

<p>When Kelly’s father replied, “Come, let’s go,” she was unable to keep herself from getting out of the truck. As she got out of the truck and followed her father, the tape she had been sitting on tore at her pubic hair and skin once again. Her father had grabbed her arm and pulled her forward in front of him despite her attempts to get back behind him. As a result, the male-dominant group could see her a naked girl.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Naked Girl!” She couldn’t place Male 1, who spoke. His statements startled her, and the others turned to look at her as a result of his reaction. She recognized one of the group of men, Barry, to be the father of a girl, and he made fun of her while pointing and laughing. “Oh, it’s Kelly, ha-ha!” he said as she moved closer to where her father worked. “The main warehouse has to be cleaned up now, kiddo”. Her father spoke to Kelly as he pulled her through the doors to the area designated as the main warehouse.</p>

<p>Kelly entered the warehouse with enormous reluctance and quickly turned her head to the left and right to scan the area for any possible dangers. She should have glanced down, though, since when she tripped on something when entering the aisles to get some of the other cleaning products she would need to use. She could see she had stepped on a bug as the space was suddenly lighted and the men laughed as they observed her. In addition, she could see pizza and other food boxes scattered on the ground in front of her.</p>

<p>The first clue that she’d been dreaming was here, because she would have smelled it, but she didn’t smell anything not the rotting leftovers, or anything for that matter. But Kelly didn’t smell it, it was unfamiliar to her thus unfamiliar to her dream self. Like she did while awake, she worked without complaining as she cleaned. But when she lifted the last pizza box, she screamed because a whole hoard of bugs came out of it and started crawling over her.</p>

<p>The smell, not the rotting food or anything else for that matter, should have been the first clue that she had been dreaming. She had never smelled rotting leftovers or anything like, so it may be because of that.Her brain was unable to connect this smell to her dream because she had never experienced it before. She cleaned while working, without complaining, exactly like she had done when she was awake. She was generally a quiet person since she didn’t want to offend anyone.</p>

<p>As Kelly set about to perform her cleaning duties here, in this warehouse, The nude teenager’s curiosity began bubbling within her, and she decided, that instead of cleaning, she should instead explore. She had never truly been in a warehouse like this before after all. She wandered through the aisles, gently touching the crates as she went. She marveled at the different shapes and sizes, wondering what precious treasures they held within.</p>

<p>As Lily continued her exploration, she stumbled upon a corner of the warehouse filled with discarded items. Amongst the abandoned machinery and forgotten tools, she discovered a forgotten box of treasures. Old Vinyl records, with some of the décor long since faded to nothingness, and cassette tapes, clearly everything had been here for quite a while. Suddenly, a familiar voice broke the silence. It was her father, calling out her name. Kelly hurriedly closed the box, before she stood up again, and returned to her father, when suddenly, an alarm blared throughout the warehouse, piercing the silence. Emily’s heart raced as her father and the security guards sprang into action. They swiftly followed the emergency procedures they had practiced countless times. Emily’s dream took on a thrilling turn as they maneuvered through the aisles and corridors, communicating through their walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>Together, they discovered a group of mischievous intruders attempting to break into one of the secured areas of the warehouse. Emily was amazed at how her father and the security guards skillfully neutralized the situation, using their training to protect the valuable assets within the warehouse.</p>

<p>The dream continued with Emily witnessing many more extraordinary events. She was astonished and grateful for the opportunity to be a part of her father’s world, even if it was only in her dreams. Now that the threat was over, Kelly had a chance to witness her father at work, and marveled at the precision and efficiency with which her father and the security guards organized the inventory. Every item had its designated place, and the workers moved with an orchestrated grace as they loaded and unloaded boxes, ensuring that each delivery was handled with care.</p>

<p>She also observed how his dedication and attention to detail drove the smooth operation of the warehouse and fostered a sense of unity among the workers. The security guards played a vital role, ensuring the safety of everyone and protecting the valuable goods within the facility. Kelly once more left her father, and</p>

<p>As they ventured deeper into the warehouse, once more, Kelly again got to see the towering racks filled with boxes, mysterious machinery humming softly in the background. The air was tinged with the scent of cardboard and anticipation. Her dream felt incredibly realistic, as she could feel the chill of the air-conditioned warehouse against her skin and the echoes of her bare footsteps resonating through the cavernous space.</p>

<p>As she looked at the shelves, she realized a few of the items, appeared to be from different nations, as she saw some boxes written in kanji, the Japanese writing style. The teenager, was about to step to the next aisle, when Forklifts zipped past, transporting pallets with precision. It scared her, as had the previous incident, but she chose not to let it bother her. But did allow things to distract her from her true purpose here however. Kelly knew that she was supposed to be cleaning, but she couldn’t help herself.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, Kelly discovered that her dream wasn’t just about observing her father at work. The security guards, realizing her excitement and curiosity, invited Lily to join them on their patrols. They showed her how to check access points, monitor surveillance cameras, and respond to any potential security issues.</p>

<p>Kelly listened intently as the guards shared their experiences and insights. Some had stories of thwarting attempted thefts, while others recounted humorous encounters with mischievous raccoons that had found their way into the warehouse.</p>

<p>In between their patrols, Kelly got to know the guards on a personal level. They were a diverse group, each with unique backgrounds and interests. They laughed and chatted as they walked the expansive aisles, forming a bond that felt like family. Her father soon found her, and reminded the teenager that she was there to clean, not socialize.</p>

<p>So she grabbed a broom, and began her cleaning duties, but still she could not help but marvel, at the vastness of the warehouse. The sound of her broom sweeping the floor echoed through the empty aisles. As she worked, she felt a sense of purpose and responsibility, just like her father and the security guards. She understood the importance of keeping the warehouse clean and organized, as it played a vital role in ensuring efficient operations and the safety of everyone involved.</p>

<p>As the time passed, Kelly became more immersed in her dream, and as she watched the other adults in the group, she began to realize the significance of teamwork and communication in such environments. She witnessed her father’s effective leadership, coordinating with the guards to maintain a smooth workflow.</p>

<p>But she focused on her work, and as she continued moving, and cleaning, she stumbled upon a neglected corner of the warehouse. Dusty boxes were piled haphazardly, and forgotten items peeked out from underneath layers of cobwebs. Feeling compelled to uncover the mystery of this abandoned area, Emily decided to clean it up, one box at a time.</p>

<p>Thus it was with determination and enthusiasm, which forced Kelly to put on a pair of gloves, which she noted felt odd to her, possibility because of how old it was, and because she was still naked as the day she was born. She began sorting through the forgotten boxes. The dust filled the air as she carefully opened each one, revealing old trinkets, books, and memories long forgotten. The dream began connecting further with her mind as she marveled at the stories hidden within the forgotten items, and creating her own narratives in her mind.</p>

<p>As Kelly cleaned, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of connection to her father, imagining him working alongside her in the dream. She cherished this shared experience, even if it was just a figment of her imagination. Kelly moved through the shelves, her head tuning up wards, as she couldn’t help but be drawn to the vintage items scattered throughout. And again, Kelly began ignoring her original task of cleaning, as she made her way towards an old trunk covered in cobwebs. With careful gloved hands, she dusted it off, revealing intricate carvings on the wooden surface.</p>

<p>Her cat-like curiosity guided her hand, and she opened the trunk and discovered a collection of antique dolls. The dolls, once cherished playthings now weathered by time, seemed to beckon Kelly with their faded smiles and worn clothes. Each one had a unique story to tell, adorned with delicate lace dresses and porcelain faces. As the teen looked at the dolls, Memories flooded her mind as she recalled the countless stories she had created for her own dolls. She remembered the adventures they embarked on, the friendships they forged, and the nurturing roles she imagined for them.</p>

<p>She couldn’t resist playing with the dolls, imagining their lives in a bygone era. At a time when money had been tight in their family, her mother had once sewn a unique doll, of fabric and cotton balls. It had been precious to Kelly because of how much care and love her mother had put into creating one. It hadn’t mattered that the doll wasn’t the one she’d wanted. The fact that her mother took the time out of her day to make her something to cheer her up had made her happy.</p>

<p>Now, the naked teen sat down, on the dirty and dusty floor, causing dust to fly up as she had. Her legs shifted position, to be cross-legged as she brought the dolls down, and soon became surrounded by them. She began reconstructing the stories with excitement, giving each doll a unique personality and role to play. The characters came alive as she spun tales of adventure, friendship, and bravery.</p>

<p>Lost in her imagination, Lily felt a profound connection to the dolls. And she would realize later, that her dreams were not just figments of her imagination but reflections of her own desires and creativity. This seemed to be the case, as with each doll she picked up, she could almost feel the love and imagination from her childhood resurfacing. Each doll had its own unique personality, its own tale waiting to be told. Emily’s mind buzzed with creativity as she envisioned worlds where these dolls could come to life.</p>

<p>One doll, with a crack across its face, was picked up, and as she looked at it, she felt a profound sense of a desire to hug it close. This placed the doll’s face, close to her right breasts, sparking a memory in which she’d pretended a doll was her baby. It seemed even as a child, uninfluenced by society the desire to be a mother was high in levels.</p>

<p>Kelly chuckled, but she knew there were more to see here. So Kelly stepped up from her position, kicking up more dust, as she tried to wipe some of the dust off of her, before she made her next choice. Her choice was to go deeper into the warehouse, and as she ventured deeper into the warehouse, her eyes widened with wonder. Towering shelves lined the narrow aisles, each dedicated to holding countless boxes. The rows seemed to stretch beyond the horizon, and Kelly felt an overwhelming sense of awe.</p>

<p>Driven by a thirst for exploration, Kelly couldn’t resist the allure of the mysterious boxes. With utmost care, she would gingerly open each one, discovering a treasure trove of old books. The yellowed pages whispered tales of forgotten lands and distant times. Some were written in a language she couldn’t comprehend, yet their beauty and mystery intrigued her even more.</p>

<p>Kelly tiptoed through the aisles, running her fingers over the spines of the books. There was an air of nostalgia, as if these old tomes held secrets waiting to be unraveled. She couldn’t help but wonder about the stories they contained what knowledge they held deep within their pages.</p>

<p>Lost in her own world, Kelly wandered deeper into the warehouse. Her footsteps echoed through the vast space, punctuating the silence. She felt a connection to the books, as if they were guiding her toward something greater.</p>

<p>And then, in a secluded corner, she stumbled upon a collection of books in a language unlike any she had ever seen. The intricate symbols danced across the pages, captivating her imagination. Kelly’s mind whirled with questions, yearning to decode their enigmatic message. However, when she looked at the cover again, and saw the image of a samurai. She knew that the story was a Japanese story, set in ancient feudal japan.</p>

<p>This made her move on, and as she did so, she stumbled upon an old phonograph, its brass horn gleaming in the faint light. Intrigued, she wound it up and listened as the scratchy notes of a long-forgotten song filled the air, transporting her back in time. The melody echoed through the vast space, captivating her entirely.</p>

<p>Mesmerized, by the old song, Kelly continued her exploration. In another corner of the warehouse, she discovered antique toys - dolls, trains, and wooden soldiers. She carefully picked up a worn-out teddy bear, feeling a connection to the past, as if the toys had stories of their own to tell. And she remembered the teddy bear she used to have, and remembered how she’d placed the teddy bear, tinto a box to donate it. She no longer needed a teddy bear now.</p>

<p>As the nude teen stepped further in her exploration, she returned to the aisle of books, and she picked one up, and as she opened one, she was instantly transported into a fantastical world of adventure and magic. The pages came alive before her eyes, and she found herself joining the characters in their thrilling quests.</p>

<p>Her father’s voice resonated through the warehouse once again. “Kelly, honey, have you finished cleaning yet?” Startled, Kelly realized that she had become so engrossed in her books that she had neglected her father’s request. Filled with a pang of guilt, she hurriedly made her way back, promising herself to make amends. But as she had no way of contacting him, she began cleaning again.</p>

<p>As she worked, she couldn’t help but glance at the alluring objects surrounding her, yearning to delve deeper into their secrets. As a result of this, she discovered hidden nooks and crannies that unveiled even more intriguing items. A vintage camera, a collection of vinyl records, and an assortment of trinkets from around the world it seemed.</p>

<p>Returning to where she had left her broom, Kelly set about completing her task. She meticulously dusted off each shelf, one by one, determined to make the warehouse shine. But Kelly reminded herself of her father’s trust and found solace in her dedication to completing the cleaning. Within her, a newfound sense of responsibility grew, reminding her of the importance of upholding commitments, even in the face of temptation.</p><div id="sr"><p></p>

<p>Though as she moved, she found the section of the warehouse, which dealt with music, rather a forgotten collection of old vinyl records. With a gleeful smile, she ran her fingers along the rows of music history, imagining the melodies that once filled the air. Kelly even found an old record player and carefully placed a record on its spinning platter, allowing the enchanting tunes to transport her to different eras. She took her brush and gently placed it over the vinyl record, which caused the brush to remove the dust from the surface, once that was done, she moved on again.</p>

<p>The scenes around her changed, and in the next area, the shelves held vintage photographs, each capturing a fleeting moment frozen in time. She saw people in various stages of joy and sorrow, their stories begging to be told. With every photograph, Kelly’s heart swelled with empathy and a desire to understand the lives of those captured within the frames.</p>

<p>Included with the photos were stacks dusty photo albums. She leafed through them, discovering faded photographs capturing moments of joy and love. Gently she blew on the dust on some of the photos and examined them further. Though she eventually grew bored of looking at these old photos, and turned her focus elsewhere. What she saw next however surprised her, as she saw vintage clothing yet. Kelly Lily cautiously touched a velvety dress and marveled at the intricate lacework. She wanted to be careful, due to how old the clothing was, and she wondered about the stories that each item held, the people who had once cherished them. The warehouse felt like a time capsule, preserving memories in the most unexpected of ways.</p>

<p>This made her wonder, if this warehouse the naked teen was standing in, was owned by the city’s public museum. She thought that that would make sense to what she was seeing, and how her father wanted her to help him keep the place clean for the new exhibits. It explained what she saw next, as she saw containers in the next area. Each container held a treasure trove of artifacts, the carefully preserved remnants of the museum’s collections. The girl’s wide eyes eagerly scanned the labels, revealing historical relics, ancient pottery, and priceless artworks. The shelves housed centuries of human history, withheld from public view as the museum underwent renovations for its grand reopening.</p>

<p>Driven by her sense of adventure, the girl couldn’t resist the allure of the unexplored. She quietly tiptoed around, careful not to disturb the tranquility of the silent space. With each step, she unearthed hidden gems from long-forgotten times.</p>

<p>As she ventured deeper, she stumbled upon a section of the warehouse filled with massive shelves that seemed to reach the lofty heights of a cathedral. Here, artifacts not yet cataloged were temporarily stored, awaiting their turn in the spotlight. Among the towering shelves, the girl felt like a tiny explorer in a realm forgotten by time. As her eyes darted from one intriguing item to another, she realized the magnitude of the museum’s collection.</p>

<p>Some objects were shrouded in white sheets, adding an air of mystery to the warehouse. The girl’s fingers itched with curiosity, yearning to unravel the secrets hidden beneath the fabric. With a cautious touch, she lifted a corner of the sheet, revealing a breathtaking sculpture.</p>

<p>Lost in the beauty and wonder surrounding her, the girl marveled at the treasures within the warehouse. It felt as though she had been transported to a world where history came alive, waiting to be shared with the world.</p>

<p>Deep within the warehouse, the girl discovered a hidden nook, tucked away from prying eyes. There, she found herself surrounded by artworks and artifacts waiting to claim their moment in history once again. It was here that the girl found solace and a sense of belonging, as if she had become a guardian of the museum’s hidden treasures.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gust of wind rushed through the warehouse, shaking the shelves and it caused an old tarnished pocket watch to fall into her hands. Kelly gave a sigh of relief as she’d never wanted to cause the priceless artifact to shatter. Carefully she placed the tiny pocket watch back, where it belonged, before spotting another watched used by the old train conductors. She examined it and its golden chain, and using memory of old videos she’d seen, she positioned the conductor’s watch to the same position on her body. Though she knew she can’t attach it, as she had nothing on that she could attach it too.</p>

<p>Even so it seemed fun to pretend that she was a conductor for a train as she placed it back, and once more she turned her focus elsewhere. As Kelly looked around, she marveled at the vastness of the warehouse. It was filled with rows upon rows of towering shelves, reaching all the way up to the high ceiling. Each shelf was labeled with the name of an exhibit, hinting at the treasures hidden within.</p>

<p>Eager to explore, Kelly set off on her adventure. She walked past shelves holding ancient artifacts, mesmerized by the history they represented. She came across a shelf labeled “Egyptian Artifacts” and paused, taking in the intricate details of the beautifully crafted statues and mummies. Moving deeper into the warehouse, Kelly stumbled upon shelves labeled “Paintings from the Renaissance.” Her eyes widened in awe as she admired the vibrant colors and lifelike portrayals of the masterpieces before her.</p>

<p>As she continued her exploration, Kelly discovered shelves containing dinosaur fossils, exotic musical instruments, and even remnants from ancient civilizations. She couldn’t believe that all these extraordinary items had been stored away, waiting to be showcased in the new museum. Driven by her curiosity, Kelly couldn’t resist the temptation to touch some of the artifacts. Carefully, she picked up a small clay pot, feeling the smooth surface beneath her fingertips. She couldn’t help but wonder about the countless stories attached to each piece.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Kelly heard a faint whisper coming from one of the shelves. Intrigued, she followed the sound until it led her to a secret passage hidden behind a painting. With a spark of excitement, Amelia ventured into the unknown. The passage took her deeper into the warehouse, and as she walked, she noticed a soft glow emanating from a distant corner. Kelly quickened her pace, her heart racing with anticipation.</p>

<p>To her amazement, she discovered a section of the warehouse filled with futuristic inventions and prototypes. The shelves were lined with gadgets that seemed to come straight out of a sci-fi movie – robots, hoverboards, and advanced virtual reality sets. Kelly couldn’t resist trying on a virtual reality headset, transporting herself to a world of fantasy and adventure. She swung on a mechanical arm, feeling the thrill of flying through the clouds. She danced with a robotic partner, twirling and laughing under the shimmering lights.</p>

<p>She’d soon removed the headset, and gently combed her hair to readjust it from the mess caused by what she’d been wearing, and set down the VR headset where it belonged. As she walked among the shelves, amidst the treasure trove of forgotten artifacts, Kelly stumbled upon an antique typewriter. She couldn’t resist the urge to press the keys, as if trying to unlock the stories trapped within its metal frame. With each keystroke, a clickety-clack of the keys of sound filled the air, as if the typewriter itself whispered tales of forgotten dreams and untold triumphs.</p>

<p>As she continued to wander, Kelly’s gaze caught sight of a dusty painting tucked away in a corner. Its colors were vibrant, yet the image was faded, mirroring the emotions of time that danced upon the canvas. With her fingertips, Kelly traced the strokes of the artist’s brush, feeling a profound connection to the timeless artwork.</p>

<p>As she took in the sights around her, she also took in the air, and she noted how the air was filled with the scent of dust and old memories. By now, the old record player and the other instruments she’d discovered had stopped playing the song she’d started. It was a good timing, as moving deeper into the warehouse, her eyes widened with wonder as she discovered a pristine vintage jukebox. A coin appeared in her hand, as if by magic, and she inserted the coin, and watched as the machine came to life, filling the air with the melodic tunes of the past. Lost in the music, Kelly swayed and danced as if transported to a different time.</p>

<p>As she moved on, she found ancient diary filled with faded pages and secrets. The diary belonged to an explorer named Amelia Thompson, who had traversed the world in search of hidden wonders. Spellbound by the tales within, Kelly found herself transported to far-off lands, imagining herself by Amelia’s side, braving the perils of untamed wilderness. Suddenly, a loud crash interrupted her reverie. Kelly quickly closed the diary, realizing she had forgotten her father’s instructions again. Sheepishly, she resumed her cleaning, determined to make up for her distraction.</p>

<p>But she thought perhaps her father would forgive her for getting distracted, and as she did, a sudden realization washed over Kelly. This warehouse was not just a storage facility; it was the heart of a grand project. The museum had been working on creating a brand new display, and this warehouse was their temporary home for all the objects they were preparing to showcase.</p>

<p>Eager to understand more, Emily continued her exploration. She found herself drawn to a series of large crates tucked away in a corner. With a mix of curiosity and trepidation, she pried the lid of one open and was greeted with a dazzling collection of gemstones and jewelry. The sight was mesmerizing, and she couldn’t help but feel as though she had stumbled upon a hidden treasure trove.</p>

<p>In addition to the gemstones and jewelry As Kelly moved from aisle to aisle, her eyes were drawn to a section filled with peculiar artifacts. Time seemed to stand still as she gazed upon an array of aged maps, ancient books, and rare trinkets. Fascinated, she couldn’t resist reaching out to touch them, the textures and stories intertwining in her imagination. Lost in her exploration, Kelly found herself studying a worn photograph of a brimming marketplace when she heard her father’s voice once again, tinged with concern. “Kelly, we must finish cleaning soon. Remember, we have a job to do.”</p>

<p>“Sorry dad!’ she called finally to apologize, but the teenager couldn’t help herself, everything she’d seen since arriving here had been amazing to the teenager. Though the real Kelly already had an idea for a plan, for her future, she’d be lying if she hadn’t said anything about working in a museum.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no matter how hard she tried to get back to work, she’d get distracted again. She came across rows of statues, paintings, antique furniture, and even ancient manuscripts carefully packed away. Driven by her insatiable curiosity, Kelly opened one of the boxes labeled “Paintings.” To her surprise, inside were vibrant and meticulously crafted works of art, each telling its own unique story. The colors danced across the canvas, enchanting her with their beauty.</p>

<p>Eager to see what else awaited her, Kelly ventured further into the warehouse. Her heart raced with anticipation as she stumbled upon massive shelves filled with shimmering crystals, and collections of rare coins and stamps. The glint of gold caught her eye, spurring her curiosity even more.</p>

<p>As she continued her exploration, Kelly stumbled upon a section labeled “Books and Manuscripts.” There, she discovered ancient tomes, their pages worn with time. She carefully opened one, and as she read the words, she felt as though she had been transported to different worlds and eras. She later closed it, before she moved on, and with each passing step, the girl surveyed the items neatly stored on the shelves. Dust-covered artifacts, antique treasures, and historic relics greeted her gaze. These were the remnants of the museum’s past exhibits, now carefully preserved as they worked on a new museum.</p>

<p>As she delved deeper into the warehouse, her excitement grew. She felt an unquenchable desire to know more about these forgotten pieces of history. With delicate hands, she brushed away layers of dust, revealing the antiquity beneath.</p>

<p>Running her fingers along the items, she could almost hear their stories whispering in her ear. She saw a weathered diary from a World War II veteran, and a once majestic crown adorned by a long-forgotten queen, in addition to a tattered canvas that once bore the brushstrokes of a famous artist. Each item held a secret, waiting to be discovered. But because she was only a teenager, and didn’t work in the field, it was likely she wouldn’t be able to find these secrets, which she realized were probably found, since these items were here.</p>

<p>But it was the massive shelves in the heart of the warehouse that truly astounded her. They towered above, reaching seemingly endless heights. Wondering what could possibly be stored there, she summoned her courage and began to climb. With each rung she ascended, she caught glimpses of incredible treasures. Ancient manuscripts written in faded ink, gleaming armor worn by knights of old, and dazzling jewels that sparkled like stars in the night sky. It was a museum within a museum, a testament to the endless wonders of history. As she climbed up further, the items became larger, she discovered an assortment of colossal exhibits. It was a hidden archive of oversized items, carefully preserved and awaiting their new home in the grand museum.</p>

<p>Kelly couldn’t help but imagine the wonder and awe these exhibits would inspire once they were unveiled to the public. She pictured children gasping in amazement, adults feeling a sense of reverence, and the museum becoming a beacon of knowledge within the town.</p>

<p>At her new height, as Kelly glanced around, her eyes widened in amazement. To her line of sight, the warehouse was filled with towering shelves that stretched as far as the eye could see. Each shelf was lined with boxes, containers, and artifacts from the museum’s collection. The atmosphere was filled with a sense of mystery and wonder. She slid down back to the ground level and with Excitement coursing through her veins, once more, she decided to explore again, completely disobeying her father’s instructions.</p>

<p>As she walked among the shelves, some of them were close together, that she had to carefully weave her way between the shelves, her footsteps echoing in the vast space. Her butt as well as her breasts made contact with the metal, causing her to gasp as she got through. In this new area as she looked around, dust-covered boxes caught her attention, beckoning her to uncover their secrets.</p>

<p>Once again unable to stop herself, Kelly opened a nearby box and discovered a collection of ancient coins. Their designs sparkled in the faint light, as if whispering stories of distant lands and forgotten civilizations. The sensation of history enveloped her leaving her in awe of the past. But it was the last corner of the warehouse that held the greatest surprise. Kelly discovered a hidden chamber filled with sketches, manuscripts, and prototypes of the museum’s upcoming exhibitions. It was a treasured trove of creativity and innovation.</p>

<p>As Kelly delved deeper into the chamber, she came across a model of a grand statue, its delicate features meticulously carved in marble. She marveled at the intricacy and beauty of the artwork, her fingers tracing the contours of the sculpted figure. The statue depicted an ancient goddess with outstretched arms, symbolizing strength and wisdom.</p>

<p>Moved by the artistry before her, Kelly imagined herself standing in the midst of the grand museum, surrounded by the awe-struck faces of visitors who would soon marvel at these masterpieces. The dream felt so vivid, so real, that she could almost hear the hushed whispers of admiration echoing in her ears. Of course she knew that if she was there, as she was now, a lot of whispers would be directed at her.</p>

<p>As Kelly continued exploring, she stumbled upon a crate labeled “Lost Treasures.” With trembling hands, she pried open the lid to reveal an assortment of precious gems, glowing like stars in a dark night sky. Their brilliance captivated her, drawing her closer as if they possessed a magnetic pull. She gently held one of the gems in her palm, feeling its smooth surface and marveling at its ethereal beauty.</p>

<p>Lost in the enchantment of her dream, the teen envisioned herself wearing an exquisite necklace adorned with these extraordinary jewels, the envy of all who beheld it. She imagined stepping onto a grand stage, the spotlight illuminating her graceful form as she shared the stage with the museum’s finest performers. The dream transported her to a world of artistry and splendor, where her every movement was met with applause and admiration.</p>

<p>Kelly chuckled to herself, as the times past, but eventually, the teenager would find her world, changing once more, as bright light, began to shine on her, the warehouse, shifting the shelves disappearing on her.</p>

<p>The light began distracting her, and forced her into reality, to the land of awake, the mundane world. The adventure she’d had of exploring a warehouse owned by a museum, had been a dream, and as she sat up on her bed, she realized some of the things she’d seen had been past exhibits. Though the Museums in her home down generally didn’t put old exhibits into storage like that, especially since the space in them was large enough to accommodate old exhibits and new ones.</p>

<p>As she sat there, she thought about how realistic the dream had been how she could smell everything, feel everything, and hear everything. The dream made her feel like she really was in an old dusty warehouse full of exhibits exploring its aisles, and shelves. She smiled to herself, as she thought about what it must be like to work in a warehouse like that. Though Kelly knew she wouldn’t want to as it wasn’t a very clean place. The word cleaning brought her back to the chores she’d been doing, such as washing dishes, and her parents.</p>

<p>“That ... That was an awesome dream’ she said to herself as she yawned and stretched her arms. Though she had to admit she was surprised by how long the dream had been, and as she glanced to the clock, she saw how long she’d been asleep for. “Would be cool to go with dad to work, would be nice to see them and to see what they actually do.” she said to herself, as she thought about why she’d never gone with her father to work before.</p>

<p>However, while she sat there, she recalled that her father really worked alongside police officers and paramedics rather than in a security operation. Though Kelly couldn’t recall exactly what he did. She believed that since she was only 16 years old, the earliest she could join her father was at the age of 17. Obviously, she must pass her classes in order to graduate from high school early.</p>

<p>Her father’s presence was made known to her when she saw the lights turn on. He was shocked to find her awake, but he listened patiently as she spoke to him about her dream. He smiled as she heard about the adventure filled dream she’d had, and he moved closer to hug her. Though his daughter did not have a bad dream, he wanted to hug her due to the events at his work.</p>

<p>He thought that based on what Kelly had told him that the dream had been a nightmare despite how it ended. Considering how clean-obsessed her mother was, her father could see. He was aware that her mother wasn’t going to allow him to take his daughter outside while she was unwashed and had a dirty face. The idea that his wife would force him to wash her thoroughly after taking her to the bathroom by himself made him nearly smile.</p>

<p>When he believed that holding her had helped, he reminded her of his job and explained that he didn’t work in security but rather in a different profession. He aided the paramedics and the cops by handling emergency call dispatch. Kelly was able to cuddle up between her parents as her father escorted her to the bed he and her mother shared</p>

<p><b>Back to the Future</b></p>

<p>When Kelly had completed sharing her tale of working for her family for a week naked, she suddenly remembered her nightmares. She believed that keeping her girls in the dark was an excellent choice since she feared that informing them about her nightmare would give her kids nightmares. She wouldn’t want to revisit the nightmare, if she could.</p>

<p>As she continued to reflect on her dreams, she realized that she really preferred her second dream over the nightmare at the time. Despite accidentally hitting her parents, the second dream was nicer and more joyful.</p>

<p>She smiled as Nicole mentioned her naked in-school experience, and she knew that this was when they became even closer than they had been as mere classmates. Though truth be told she’d had a crush on Nicole for a while even before then, and had been grateful for the opportunities that presented themselves.</p></div>

<div class="end-note"><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this story. While it isn’t my first story, it is the first of the Slavery Genre. I chose to go for what I call a level 1 Slavery story. <br>
<br>
In addition, this time, I tried to be careful with the grammar check program, I used in addition to quillbot for paraphrasing. But if you, the reader still recommend that I get someone to be an editor, I shall do so this time.<br>
<br>
Also I’d recently reposted Zoe Naked in school in which I hope is much better now.</p></div>
