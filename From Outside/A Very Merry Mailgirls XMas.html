<p>
Erin O'Neill stepped into another world, and left the real one behind.<br>
<br>
The lobby of US Financial's Park Place facility was large, open, and well lit. Little clusters of sofas and chairs stood guard to either side, along with the same sorts of potted plants and topiaries that graced corporate offices worldwide. Garland had been hung for the season, and an oversized Christmas tree had been tastefully decorated and placed by the door. Even the security desk had been done up, wrapped with a thick red ribbon and sporting an oversized bow.<br>
<br>
It was a quarter to three on Christmas Eve, but the lobby was still busy. Most people were nodding to the two security guards and wishing them a Merry Christmas on their way out. Out to their cars, off to the ferry, or on to the commuter rail. Out into the lightly falling snow. Home to their families and loved ones, home for the holiday. There were a handful of little congregations of people, though, still milling about and conversing in loud, joyful voices. Most did their best to at least pretend to ignore the goings-on at the security desk, or the line-up to the left, or the show at the center of the lobby. But there was a mixed group - men and women both - whistling, cheering, and clapping; one of the women even had her phone out and was snapping pictures.<br>
<br>
The exposed pussy that greeted Erin and Catherine as they entered the lobby, though, stole focus.<br>
<br>
Two pillories had been placed halfway between the front entrance and the security desk. One was unoccupied. In the other, and facing away from them, was a girl without a stitch of clothes, bent at the midsection and fitted with a spreader bar at her ankles. Her neck and wrists had been secured into the pillory. And, as Erin and her stepmother rounded the display, they saw that the pillory itself wasn't the end of her suffering. Dangling beneath her, and held in place with nipple clamps, was a pair of red-and-green Christmas ornaments. These, plus the Santa hat, were apparently a nod to the holiday. The O-ring gag inserted into her mouth and secured behind her head, though, didn't appear to have anything to do with the season.<br>
<br>
Catherine Ryan breathed an audible sigh of relief as they passed. Erin understood why - the naked girl was a redhead. Catherine's daughters, both blondes, weren't the victims of this particular exhibition. At least, not here and now. Not today.<br>
<br>
To this side of the security desk, another girl stood trembling in just her bra and panties, with her back to the little party cheering and applauding her less than twenty feet away. She paid them no attention, but it was clear that their presence was affecting her. A pair of boots was on the floor beside her, and a crumpled-up pile of clothes had been placed on the desk. She looked to the African-American woman on the far side, as if expecting her to say something - to either scare the audience away, or to offer her a few words of support. The security guard did neither. Finding the courage to press forward anyway, the girl slid one bra strap off her shoulder, and then the other. She tugged the cups down at the same time, exposing her naked breasts, and twisted the bra three-quarters of the way around her body to unfasten the snap. Her admirers roared with laughter.<br>
<br>
"Underwear, too," Erin heard the second security guard tell her. "Come on."<br>
<br>
The girl nodded nervously, and wriggled out of her panties. Another cheer erupted from the audience.<br>
<br>
The second security guard, a Hispanic man in his forties, accepted the girl's underthings with a smile, and took the girl in, in her entirety. Dark hair, done up a bun. Moderately-sized breasts. Good-looking, though not stunningly so - not nearly as attractive the redhead in the stocks behind her. There was a small patch of pubic hair between her legs that caught the guard's attention, and he called it out. "That's got to go when you get downstairs."<br>
<br>
"Even just as a visitor?" the girl asked meekly. Her accent was hard to place. French?<br>
<br>
"Yup," he answered. "It's in the agreement you signed. The girls will show you where to get a razor when you get down there."<br>
<br>
As Catherine and Erin approached the security desk, the female guard peeled away and looked up in their direction. She recognized Catherine right away. She grinned. "One and Two."<br>
<br>
Catherine smiled politely. "One and Two," she affirmed. "I left an impression?"<br>
<br>
"I never forget a face," the security guard beamed. Her nametag identified her as "Andrews."<br>
<br>
Gesturing towards the now-naked brunette to her left, Catherine pointed out, "We didn't have to do this here last time."<br>
<br>
Andrews shook her head and apologized. "Downstairs, right? Outside the locker room?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
"New rule. Just in time for the holiday." She shrugged, indicating that she didn't have anything to do with the decision. She was just here to enforce it.<br>
<br>
Catherine looked nervously over her shoulder at crowd. "Anything else new? Anything else we need to know?"<br>
<br>
"Well, they moved the...er...equipment," she answered, searching for the right word. She meant the pillories behind them.<br>
<br>
"A little too cold in the courtyard this time of year?"<br>
<br>
Andrews nodded. "All over the building now. Benches, cages, racks, suspension devices..." Shaking her head, but with a little chuckle, she added, "Can't escape 'em. They're all over the place. That and the ladies' underwear."<br>
<br>
"Those were up when I was here last time," Catherine said. "A bold design choice."<br>
<br>
"It's definitely different than when I started here a couple of years ago."<br>
<br>
"A different world," Erin added. Andrews glanced in Erin's direction, and looked her up and down. "Hi," Erin cheeped, and offered a nervous wave.<br>
<br>
Andrews offered a polite "hello" in response, but came back to Catherine. "Another daughter?"<br>
<br>
"Stepdaughter," Catherine said. "Couldn't talk her out of it."<br>
<br>
Andrews offered a grunt, and a disapproving look at Erin. To Erin, she asked, "Is that right?"<br>
<br>
"It is," she answered. "I can do this for a couple of days."<br>
<br>
To Catherine, Andrews warned, "You be careful with her. She's a looker. You don't want another one."<br>
<br>
Catherine stared at Erin, as if to say, "See!" To Andrews, she responded, "I know, I know. Her father would disown me. If that happens, I might have to stay, myself."<br>
<br>
Andrews laughed. "I'll put in a good word, if that happens," she said. Gesturing to the older woman's figure, despite being hidden beneath a coat, she offered, "Though, you be careful, yourself. These assholes? These little experiments they run here? You might be end up being a whole family of mailgirls."<br>
<br>
Catherine waved off the concern. A little too casually, Erin felt. "Mail-Woman," the forty-nine-year-old corrected the security guard. "In my case."<br>
<br>
"Mail-Woman, then," Andrews laughed. "Though, damn, if I looked as good as you..."<br>
<br>
The security guard trailed off, and looked away. Andrews wasn't mailgirls material. She was more than a little heavy-set, and not exactly the sort of beauty USF had a reputation for targeting.<br>
<br>
Catherine Ryan, on the other hand? If she'd been ten years younger, there'd have been no doubt the company would be pursuing her to turn its "sisters act" into a "mother-and-daughters show." Five-foot-three or maybe five-foot-four, with a figure that would have been the envy of women half her age, Catherine was nearly every bit the goddess that her daughters were. Maybe even more so, given that she had aged so gracefully that magic or witchcraft had to have been involved. It had been a decade since Erin's father had first introduced Catherine to her, and Catherine still looked like she could have passed for thirty-nine. Blonde hair, a chest to die for, and hips that no one would have believed had birthed two children; there was no question from whom Sarah and Sophie Scott had gotten their looks.<br>
<br>
Not that Erin O'Neill was hard on the eyes. She'd grown into her height, after more than a few awkward teenage years towering over the boys her age. She'd been rail-thin, back then. Though she'd sprouted up early, her boobs had come in late. And, of course, there'd been the acne. But it had all come together in the end, and - aside from those times she was standing next to Catherine or beside the Scott girls - she was capable of turning heads in her own right. As she'd flipped through pictures of mailgirls online, she had convinced herself more and more that she wouldn't be embarrassing herself by inserting herself in among them. She'd be embarrassing herself, sure. Of that, there was no question - it was raison d'etre for a mailgirls program, overall. But she was tall and slender, and in reasonably good shape. She was thirty, but only just; her sorority days at Arizona State weren't that far removed. She might not have been the sort of high-end lingerie model that USF had a history of enlisting into their mailgirl ranks, but she was pretty, in a girl-next-door brunette sort of way.<br>
<br>
"Alright, so..." Andrews began, as she handed a pair of clipboards to Erin and her stepmother, "I know you two signed these already, when you set this visit up. But, because of what you're volunteering yourself for, the lawyers like to make sure you're scrawling your signature here, there, and everywhere a few dozen times. Thumbprint, too. Just to make absolutely, one hundred percent sure you know what you're getting yourself into and what you're giving the company permission to do."<br>
<br>
The document was eleven pages long, single-spaced, and in ten-point font. Erin knew it backwards and forwards. She'd spent hours poring over it at home, going line by line, paragraph by paragraph, clause by clause. It laid out the conditions of her visit, in detail - everything from the surrender of her clothes to the surrender of her very name. For the next forty-some hours, Erin O'Neill would be, for intents and purposes, a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
She flipped through it, counting the pages and glancing it over to make sure that USF hadn't slipped something else into the agreement since its last iteration. Nothing appeared to be any different from the document she'd signed, scanned, and emailed back to Human Capital - but in a perfect world, she'd have gone through it again, in detail, to make absolutely sure. Being tricked into signing her life away was practically a rite of passage for a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
Erin cringed, bit her lip, and signed her name on the last page. She was here for the "mailgirls experience," after all.<br>
<br>
Catherine gave the contract no such scrutiny. She'd done this before, and come out the other side. Not for this long, and not overnight. But she was here to see her daughters, and likely would have signed anything USF shoved in front of her to see them again.<br>
<br>
"Alright, girls," Andrews said to them both in a friendly tone, after they'd run their thumbs over an electronic reader. "It's time."<br>
<br>
The moment of truth. After all her research, all her preparation and planning, the moment had arrived. Erin was going to strip down in USF's lobby and join her stepsisters in the nude.<br>
<br>
She glanced nervously at Catherine, and Catherine offered a reassuring look. To Andrews, the older woman asked, "Can we put our things in our suitcases?"<br>
<br>
Andrews answered in the affirmative. "That works," she said.<br>
<br>
"Now or never," Catherine sighed, and shrugged off her coat.<br>
<br>
"Now or never," Erin answered timidly, and did the same.<br>
<br>
The girl who'd been at the desk when Erin and Catherine had arrived was a few feet away, and was being tended to by the male security guard. "Ramirez," his nametag read. The girl, on the other hand, was to be known as "VC." So said the black ink Ramirez had just applied to her right hip. "Visitor C," Erin surmised. She and Catherine were to be "Visitor D" and "Visitor E."<br>
<br>
She hoped she wouldn't be the one forced to sport "VD" scrawled upon her naked body for the couple of days.<br>
<br>
She knew she would be.<br>
<br>
"Mistress Rei may need to re-do this," Ramirez was telling the girl. "After a shower and a shave."<br>
<br>
"Uh...okay," was the response. What else was she going to say?<br>
<br>
Erin folded her coat neatly, got into a crouch, and opened her suitcase. She risked a glance in the direction of the group laughing and cheering only twenty feet away, but chose to look through them and pretend they weren't there.<br>
<br>
The redhead in the pillory was watching, too; beneath her, the Christmas ornaments hanging from her nipples bounced comically with each breath.<br>
<br>
Against the far wall, on their knees, were two naked girls - "VA" and "VB," presumably. Both were in the standard mailgirls "resting" position, called simply "Knees" here at USF. Knees apart, left wrist clutched in the right hand behind the back. They were facing the wall, with their bare behinds exposed to open lobby, but - piling insult on top of insult - they'd been fitted with black leather blindfolds. Neither had yet received collars, but Erin knew they were coming in the near future.<br>
<br>
Erin placed her coat on top of her other clothes in the suitcase. What they'd wear to Park Place that afternoon had been a hand-wringing exercise in and of itself. Given that they had fully expected to strip soon after arriving, and would remain naked until the day after Christmas, choosing an outfit for the trip from their hotel to the building might have seemed unimportant. Had she had her way, Erin would have arrived in a pair of sweatpants and a tee-shirt. Hell, there was something to be said for the cheap-looking shifts the Fabrikam girls wore to-and-from work back in LA. Simple. Easy. Straightforward. On-and-off. No fuss.<br>
<br>
Catherine, though, had insisted they dress up, and Erin had given in. When Sarah had been in-town, at USF Plaza, she'd come to and from work dressed as if she held a normal job on Wall Street. Despite the presence of the mailgirls, USF still maintained a formal dress code, one that seemed like a throwback to yesteryear. Women wore skirts and dresses, stockings and hose, pumps and heels. When Erin and Sarah had chatted that Sunday, Sarah had backed Catherine and suggested Erin might come in a skirt and a blouse. She could be forgiven the pantyhose, but she should dress in something nice. Whether it was outside the mailgirls locker room - as Erin, Catherine, and Sarah had expected - or here in the lobby, Erin was going to have to get naked in front of an audience. She didn't want to get things started off looking like a slob, did she?<br>
<br>
Erin stood, and kicked off her high-heeled boots. She'd given in to her stepmother's insistence, and wore a simple, tight-fitting, button-down white blouse, tucked neatly into a flouncy black A-line skirt entirely inappropriate for the weather outside. Beside her, Catherine wore a muted, black-and-white leopard-print faux wrap dress that tied at the waist and hung to her knees. Both of them could have passed for secretaries, or accountants, or lawyers, or any other variety of the office drones who populated Park Place. For the moment, at least.<br>
<br>
Erin's hands trembled as she undid the first button of her shirt. And then the next. And then the next. And then the next. As she did so, she revealed a white, guipure lace bra, with sheer cups through which her nipples would be plainly visible. The bra, as well as the matching white lace tanga, had been a recent purchase, and - outside of trying them on - today was the first time she'd worn either. She'd spent more on the set than she'd originally intended to; Catherine had warned her that USF had kept her underwear when she'd come out in September. But Erin had felt sexier and more confident in her body when she'd picked them out, a feeling that seemed important when undressing in public.<br>
<br>
The younger girl was still untucking her blouse when a roar went up behind her. Catherine, determined and focused, had simply found the hemline of her dress and pulled it up over her head. The group watching cheered.<br>
<br>
Erin had seen her stepmother in a two-piece bikini on more than one occasion, but she found herself marveling at the other woman's body now all the same. Despite being forty-nine, and despite having been pregnant twice, Catherine was a beauty, and set unrealistic expectations for Erin about what to expect from the aging process. Today, she wore a black, full-coverage satin bra, and a matching black thong. She was still in her heels.<br>
<br>
Erin followed Catherine's lead, and took off her shirt. She slid her thumbs into the waistline of her skirt, and wriggled free. Both items were deposited in a heap into her suitcase. She wanted to get this over with. She wasn't going to stand here in her underwear, folding her clothes, and stalling. Wasting no time, she unhooked her bra behind her back, slipped it off, and then went for her panties. Erin O'Neill was now naked in the lobby of US Financial, naked in public, naked in front of her stepmother and a good number of total strangers.<br>
<br>
Her tattoo caught the attention of the little group openly watching and applauding, as Erin had expected it to; tattoos weren't allowed among the actual roster of USF mailgirls. Just above her bikini line were six blue stylized little fish swimming one way, and a single little red one swimming the other. When she'd gotten it in Tempe, eight or nine years earlier, she'd liked the idea that she was the single red fish, swimming in her own direction. The fact that she had willingly and knowingly agreed to be a de facto mailgirl for the next day and a half, and that she'd just gotten naked while being watched, perhaps underlined that sentiment.<br>
<br>
She crouched back down, overly cautious about exposing her sex to the room. Her back to Andrews, she snuck her tanga into one of the pockets of the jeans she'd brought with her, and then buried the jeans themselves beneath her coat, her skirt, and her blouse. Human Capital, or the Scott girls' mistress, or maybe even Andrews and Ramirez themselves, would likely be rifling through her things and pilfering the panties at some point that very afternoon. Erin doubted her little hiding spot would keep them safe, but she felt the need to try all the same.<br>
<br>
For that same reason, Erin had left her engagement ring and wedding band at home. It had hurt her husband Ben, she knew, but he hadn't said so out loud. Given what she was already doing to him with this little trip, it had pained her to hurt him again like that. Catherine had worn her rings, and was at that very moment tucking her jewelry into her toiletries bag. But then, Catherine hadn't come clean to Erin's father Patrick about what trips to USF required of female visitors, as Erin had to Ben. Erin could deal with the company snatching her underwear; she couldn't bear the thought of losing her rings.<br>
<br>
Still, though, Erin did have on a few other pieces. Her earrings, her necklace, her bracelet, and a simple sterling silver ring were all slipped into her clutch, and placed carefully in her suitcase. Mailgirls, and therefore the mailgirls' visitors, were not allowed jewelry of any kind - save that which was given to them by the company. There was an ugly black collar waiting for Erin in the near future.<br>
<br>
Both her suitcase and Catherine's were placed up on the security desk, and Andrews smiled as she took possession of them. Ramirez, meanwhile, had finished with Visitor C for the moment, though the girl stood waiting, awkwardly, for her next set of instructions. "Wow," he offered, as he took in Catherine. "Wow, wow, wow," he said to Erin.<br>
<br>
Erin blushed instinctively.<br>
<br>
Ramirez fixated on Erin's crotch. He pointed at it, and called Visitor C's attention to it. "Hey, 'Hairy Cunt'! That's how it's done."<br>
<br>
Erin had gotten waxed that weekend. She and Catherine had both dutifully complied with their agreements' restrictions on hair below the neckline.<br>
<br>
"Emilio!" Andrews scolded him. "What have I said about the fucking nicknames?"<br>
<br>
Ramirez waved her off, and stepped towards Erin and her stepmother. Without warning, or asking for permission, he grabbed Erin roughly by the hip, and marked her with a "VD." Catherine received similar treatment, and was graced with a "VE."<br>
<br>
"Visitor D," he announced. "And Visitor E." With mischief in his eyes, he then looked to Andrews, and offered, "Or, how about 'Dyke Food'? And 'Loose Pussy'?"<br>
<br>
Erin shared a look of horror with Catherine. Which one of them was "Dyke Food"? Was it Erin?<br>
<br>
"For fuck's sake!" Andrews answered back, shaking her head. She looked like she was about to apologize for her partner's behavior, but seemed to think better of it. Instead, she let out an exhausted sigh, and told them, "Start getting used to this sort of shit. It's only going to get worse."<br>
<br>
To a point, Erin hoped. For a little while, at least. They'd been told that the building would empty out that afternoon, and that it would really just be Security, the mailroom staff, and their visitors here at Park Place until the morning of the 26th. If they could make it through this, and out of the lobby, it'd really only be the actual mailgirls they'd have to contend with.<br>
<br>
And their mistress.<br>
<br>
Erin cast another timid look in the pillory's direction.<br>
<br>
As she did so, another woman approached. She had to have been in her fifties, at least. Early sixties, even? But, like Catherine, she'd aged gracefully, and reminded Erin of the actress from the Pierce Brosnan "Thomas Crown Affair" and the "Lethal Weapon" movies. Rene Russo, right? Erin was pretty confident it was Rene Russo.<br>
<br>
"Jesus!" she shouted in Catherine's direction. "You can't be one of their mothers!"<br>
<br>
"Mailgirls One and Two," Catherine replied.<br>
<br>
The other woman whistled, and looked Erin's stepmother up-and-down. To Andrews, she commented, "I can't compete with that. That's just unfair." She undid her coat, and placed it on the counter above the security desk. Again, to Andrews, she asked, "Tell me I'm not the oldest here today."<br>
<br>
"Just by a little," the security guard said with a smile. "It's mostly girls in their 20's and 30's."<br>
<br>
Rene Russo sized Erin up, and then went on to do the same to Visitor C. "Unfair. Completely unfair!" She turned her back to Ramirez, and instructed him, "Mr. Ramirez. Zipper, please."<br>
<br>
The male security guard gleefully obliged, and unzipped the back of her dress. This wasn't her first visit to Park Place. This wasn't the first time Ramirez had done this for her. She oozed confidence and sexuality. As her dress came off, she revealed that she was sporting nothing underneath. Even being half this woman's age, Erin worried about her body being judged against such a head-turner<br>
<br>
"Mailgirl Fourteen," the woman, still in her heels, said to Catherine. Her daughter was Mailgirl Fourteen, she meant. She held out a hand and introduced herself. "Angela Giannini. Though, I guess I'm 'Visitor F' today."<br>
<br>
"Catherine Ryan."<br>
<br>
Andrews coughed uncomfortably. "Visitor E," she corrected Catherine. "That's your one warning. Visitor C. Visitor D. Visitor E. Visitor F. No names once you've checked in."<br>
<br>
Angela Giannini - Visitor F - rolled her eyes. In the mocking tone, she answered back, "'Ma'am, per Human Capital, I am to be called by my mail room visitor's designation.' I suppose this is where I point out that I haven't checked in yet?"<br>
<br>
"She has," Andrews replied. "And I don't want Mistress Rei calling me out for not slapping her around."<br>
<br>
"Fine, fine," Angela relented. She lifted her left leg, and removed one of her heels. She placed it on the desk, and then removed the other. "So, check me in, already!"<br>
<br>
It was now Andrews's turn to roll her eyes. "You check her in," she told Ramirez. "I'll bring these three over." She reached beneath the desk, and pulled out one, two, three blindfolds. "Alright girls. Come with me."<br>
<br>
"I have to sign this every time?" Angela complained in a joking tone, when Ramirez handed her the clipboard.<br>
<br>
Erin, now to be known simply as "Visitor D," followed behind Andrews, Visitor C, and Visitor E. As she left her clothes behind, and her name along with it, this fantasy of hers became very, very real. She was pushed to her knees against the wall, blindfolded, and left to wait for Mistress Rei. She'd imagined this moment countless of times since that September. She'd prepared for it. She'd researched it. She'd talked it over with Catherine. She'd talked it over with Ben.<br>
<br>
And, still, she was terrified about what awaited her, and fought the urge to renege and back out. It wasn't too late. Her things were still at the security desk. Catherine would understand. Sarah and Sophie would understand. She didn't have to do this. She didn't have to spend her Christmas this way. Naked. Imprisoned. Humiliated. Treated like an animal.<br>
<br>
She stayed put. Something had called her here. And something would keep her here. Visitor D was perhaps more afraid of what that something was, inside of her, than anything USF could have inflicted upon her.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Erin had left the real world behind the moment she stepped into the lobby at Park Place.<br>
<br>
But that wasn't really the truth of it, was it?<br>
<br>
The real world - the world that Erin had grown up in, the world in which it would have been unthinkable to treat women this way, the world before mailgirls - was long gone.<br>
<br>
Some years earlier, a single Japanese company had launched the very first mailgirls program on a lark, after an executive suggested it as a joke. They responded to early legal challenges and weathered a storm of bad publicity, but also began to notice the effects the program was having on the company's bottom line. Turnover - at least after an initial spike - plummeted. So too did usage of vacation time, sick time, and other leaves-of-absence. And productivity, stacked against just about any measure, skyrocketed exponentially.<br>
<br>
Copycat programs sprouted up throughout Tokyo. Then the rest of Japan. Southeast Asia. Eastern and Central Europe. The Pacific Northwest was the beachhead in the United States, but San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix followed suit. US Financial had been among the first on the East Coast, but it was far from the last. The phenomenon was still in its infancy here in the Americas, but it was gaining traction fast. There'd been no shortage of protests and suits. When Congress reconvened in DC in January, the "Mailgirl Hearings" would be appointment TV for the so-called "Whitestocking" groups fighting against the trend. But there'd been no shortage of volunteers, either, and there were now dozens of "Blackstocking" groups organized in defense of the programs, and in defense of the "individual life, individual choice" rallying call of the girls who'd agreed to subject themselves to this lifestyle.<br>
<br>
Erin O'Neill, for her part, had never paid the controversy much attention. She didn't think much of the companies who had decided to roll out mailgirl programs on the West Coast. But that distaste for how they were treating their employees had never boiled over into a frothing rage. She'd managed to skate through without affixing her signature to a petition or participating in a boycott. If she'd really taken the time to think about mailgirls, at all, she'd likely have ended up in the neo-libertarian camp that whatever agreement these companies had entered into with these girls didn't really have anything to do with her. She was a high school English teacher; it wasn't as if her school district would be launching a program of its own any time in the near future.<br>
<br>
But then, in September, Catherine had informed her that both of her stepsisters had chosen the mailgirl path. Sarah had put her studies on hold. Sophie had dropped out of dental school and called off her wedding. Both had sold themselves into servitude to US Financial, and were now scurrying interoffice envelopes back-and-forth at the company's back office location in Jersey City - completely butt-ass naked. It was so out-of-character for them both that Erin had initially assumed that something had snapped inside of each of them, and that this was some sort of mental breakdown. But then something had snapped inside of Erin, too, and suddenly she couldn't get enough on what their life was like. She couldn't stop thinking about them. She couldn't stop wondering what it was like to be a mailgirl. She couldn't stop speculating on what had driven them to this, on what had driven hundreds of girls to this.<br>
<br>
She wasn't alone. The Internet was abuzz with the madness of it all. The Red Pill folks cackled and crowed over the rise of the Mailgirl. A right-wing radio host gave rise to what he referred to as his "Bridle Theory;" that, deep down, all women craved to be subservient and controlled, and that this had been the natural order of things through most of human history. Conservatives blamed liberals for the permissiveness of modern society and the breakdown of religious mores. Liberals blamed conservatives for blatant misogyny and rampant sexism among male-controlled board rooms. Support groups began popping up for mailgirls themselves. For the families of girls who'd entered into this life. Discussion groups. Porn sites.<br>
<br>
At one point or another that Fall, Erin had visited them all.<br>
<br>
There was an acronym now being bandied about on the forums - on Mailgirls Exposed, on Mailgirl Submissions, on the Heteroclite, on the Post Office - that Erin began to reluctantly self-identify with: "MGFG." "Mailgirl Fangirl." She saw it on the Post Office more than the others, but it was a contributor on Mailgirls Exposed, "JcockMGFG," whom Erin had begun following religiously, that had begun to normalize the term and made Erin realize what she'd become. There were pictures and stories about the goings-on at DDE and Mizutomo in Seattle, at Sloane Guaranty & Trust in Maryland, and countless others across the country. But JcockMGFG was apparently an employee at USF, and provided insight into what the daily routines were like for USF's roster of mailgirls. She waxed philosophically about the lives of these girls, and openly fantasized about what it would be like to be one of them. Erin found herself doing the same.<br>
<br>
Among the Scott sisters' friends and families, it was like a bomb had gone off. The girls' father, who'd been in and out of their life since the divorce, had cut off all contact with them, accusing Sarah of doing this out of spite for him. Erin's father Patrick - the girls' stepfather - still jumped on the phone with them when they called, but avoided any discussion about their jobs or their lives, and changed the topic any time Erin dared to bring it up. Sophie's fiancée, John, wanted nothing to do with his former bride-to-be, and was more than happy to box up all of Sophie's things for USF to stick in storage somewhere, to be rid of her and the humiliation of it all. Catherine had been out-of-her-mind with grief at first, and returned to California after her first visit seemingly shell-shocked by what Sarah and Sophie were being forced to endure.<br>
<br>
Erin, though, had gone elbow-deep into the online community. Not a day had gone by that she hadn't visited Mailgirls Exposed or the Post Office, or thought about Sarah and Sophie, or wondered about the what and the why of it all. She'd read Sarah's paper, about what "life among the mailgirls" had been like the previous summer; dry and academic as it might have been, there were still snippets that hinted at sexual self-discovery and the "freedom" of submissiveness. JcockMGFG filled in some of the blanks - the collars and the leashes, the inspections, the abuse and degradations that got worse with each passing day, and the rampant masturbation. Erin had even found pictures posted of Sarah Scott, inked with a number "13" on one hip and half-in/half-out of a Pepperdine cheerleader's outfit with a lollipop in her pussy. She'd saved and deleted those pictures on her laptop half a dozen times, hidden away in a secret folder that Ben wouldn't find.<br>
<br>
It had been hard to reconcile those images of Sarah with the Sarah Scott whom Erin had known over the last ten years. Erin had been in college when her father had introduced her to Catherine, and Sarah herself was already at Pepperdine by the time to two wed. Sarah was gorgeous, to be sure, but she'd been a bookworm and an egghead. Buttoned-up and closed off. This was a girl who'd been a band-geek, who'd never had much of a love life, and who'd always been singularly focused on her academics. But that Sarah Scott had somehow morphed into USF's Mailgirl Number Thirteen, a naked slut who touched herself in public, who allowed herself to be spanked in front of an audience, and who - to hear JcockMGFG tell it - regularly went down on other mailgirls in a game of sexual quid pro quo.<br>
<br>
This transformation, though, was common among mailgirls - at least as Erin understood it. It was one of the reasons that so many former mailgirls in Asia and Europe supported the further expansion of mailgirl programs worldwide: they wanted other girls to have the opportunity for this "awakening" themselves. This transformation, though, was why so many of the Whitestocking groups discounted the advocacy of those very same former mailgirls; to hear them tell it, these girls were suffering from Stockholm syndrome, and their confessions and feelings couldn't be trusted.<br>
<br>
Erin hadn't protested against the mailgirl concept when it first landed in the States. Nor, however, had she suddenly risen to its defense in the wake of her stepsisters' decision. She was now firmly in the "individual life, individual choice" camp, but she wasn't yet willing to proclaim so publicly. The scorn from her friends and coworkers would have been withering. She wasn't going to show up with a resume-in-hand at Capstone Partners, or Fabrikam, or Okajima Heavy Industries, or one of other LA-based mailgirl programs. But she understood the appeal. She felt its pull.<br>
<br>
She loved Ben O'Neill with all her heart; he was the love of her life. Their sex life wasn't bad, per se. Or disappointing. Or anything like that. It was fine. Perfectly fine. Serviceable. Vanilla. It was the sex enjoyed by a couple who'd been together for almost a decade at that point. The mailgirls on the message boards she frequented, though, talked in terms of "awakening" and "discovery" and "exploration," and tapping into theretofore unknown kinks and turn-ons. Even from the outside, Erin had begun to feel the same way, as if she were missing something. As if there was an itch Ben wasn't quite scratching, a psychological g-spot she hadn't even known was there before that Fall. She thought back to the one-night-stands she'd had early in college, and how they'd made her feel. Dirty. Naughty. Whore-ish. Like a piece of meat. And, part of her missed that feeling; that feeling of being sexually objectified and sexually devoured. Of being, at some base level, nothing more than one-time fuck.<br>
<br>
Ben didn't understand it. Ben couldn't understand it. Erin wasn't sure that she understood it, herself. But the Internet did. The forums. The mailgirls. The MGFGs. Confessions poured out on Mailgirls Exposed and Mailgirl Submissions. A mailgirl in Phoenix tracked and documented her descent into sexual deviancy on the Heteroclite. The Post Office had pictures of girls eating out of dog bowls, peeing in litter boxes, and fitted with any number of leashes, collars, gags, hoods, and blindfolds. For those girls who craved an IRL fix, but who weren't quite mailgirl material, or who weren't yet willing to sign away two years of their life or publicly proclaim such dark and deep-seated desires, there was even a company in Oakland promising the "mailgirl experience" a weekend at a time.<br>
<br>
Erin didn't need a trip to the Bay Area to get the "mailgirl experience." US Financial had rolled out a 24/7 model in Jersey City, an experiment they'd seeded with Sarah and Sophie Scott. The girls would be kept on-campus, at Park Place, for the full duration of their contracts - beginning to end. Whereas Sarah had previously been allowed to go home at night, when she was working in Manhattan, there'd be no daily escape from the mailgirls life. Visitors would be permitted, but with a caveat: all female visitors would be expected to strip and subject themselves to same strict rules and regulations expected of the actual mailgirls.<br>
<br>
Catherine had indeed seemed shell-shocked upon her return to California, after visiting her daughters for the first time. But she hadn't shared any of the specifics with Patrick - which suited Patrick just fine - including the fact that Catherine had had to surrender her own clothes to see Sarah and Sophie in New Jersey. And it wasn't until Erin began pressing her for details over Thanksgiving that Catherine even admitted as much to her. By that point, Erin knew more about the program at Park Place, through the Internet, than Catherine divulged. By that point, USF had announced guidelines for Holiday visitors. By that point, Erin had already decided she'd go and visit her stepsisters herself.<br>
<br>
Erin had shared her interest with Catherine before she'd opened up to Ben, and before she'd spoken to either of the Scott sisters about whether or not they even wanted her there. Catherine did her best to talk her out it, to dissuade her from even thinking about it. She'd already lost two daughters to US Financial; she wasn't ready to lose a third. There was shame and embarrassment in it all; humiliation was part and parcel with the daily routine of a mailgirl, and Catherine didn't want to expose Sarah and Sophie to the gawking of Erin O'Neill if she didn't have to. But as Erin got the older woman talking, she suspected there was something more, something that Erin had found buried deep inside her own psyche the more she learned about mailgirls. The idea of returning to New Jersey, and surrendering herself to however many days of mailgirl rules, was something that excited Catherine at a base level.<br>
<br>
Sarah, too, tried to talk Erin out of coming a week later, when Erin had first broached the topic with her stepsister. The girls had some limited opportunities for phone calls, though Erin was sure their conversation was being monitored ("God, what's wrong with me?" Erin had thought to herself. "Why was that violation of privacy a turn-on?"). Sarah - who couldn't be referred to as "Sarah," but only as "Mailgirl Number Two" now - had warned her about the humiliation and cruelty Erin could expect to suffer. The nudity, of course. But also, the leashes, the spankings, the verbal abuse. The mailgirls had no beds to sleep on; they slept on the hard, tiled floor of the locker room. The mailgirls had no toilets to offer; they were forced to use Japanese-style squat toilets that amounted to little more than drains in the floor. Erin hadn't blinked, though; she knew all this already. And, sensing that some of Sarah's objections were rooted less in concern for Erin's well-being, Erin assured the girl that she could step away, and grant Sarah some illusion of privacy, if Sarah needed to take care of more carnal needs.<br>
<br>
Sophie had been more supportive, and Sarah eventually gave in. So, too, did Catherine. Ben had been a harder sell, but Erin hadn't been comfortable making the trip if she hadn't cleared it with her husband first. Outside of maybe her doctors, no one but Ben had seen her naked since they'd begun dating oh-so-long-ago, and objecting to the idea of his wife becoming a borderline sex slave for a few days was well within his rights. There'd been tears, and shouting, and apologies up the wazoo. Erin abandoned the defense that this was about supporting Sarah, Sophie, and Catherine pretty early on. This was about Erin. This was about one last wild adventure. This was about self-discovery and self-exploration. This what about a need that Erin couldn't properly explain.<br>
<br>
Sophie's fiancée, John, had thrown his hands up and expunged any trace of Sophie from his life. When Ben and Erin had helped pack up her stepsister's things that September, John had ranted angrily about how she could have done this to him, and about the whore she'd become. As they'd gotten into the car afterwards, and began the drive home from University Park, Ben had reflected on Sophie's choice.<br>
<br>
"I don't get it," he said, looking out the window. "But maybe this is just something she needed to do."<br>
<br>
"I don't get it," he repeated to Erin that December. "But if this something you need to do..."<br>
<br>
Erin had cried. Ben had gotten drunk. But the next morning, lying beside her in bed, he'd told her he'd support her. "If this is something you need to do, do it. If it's something you need to get out of your system, do it. If it's just this, and it's two nights, and it's there and back, then go do it. And if turns into something else..." He hesitated. "...if it turns in something you else, and you need to stay...I'll wait for you."<br>
<br>
The world they'd known didn't exist any longer. This was a world in which mailgirls were very much a reality. And this trip, this there-and-back over Christmas, was more than just a fantasy or something Erin simply wanted to do. It was a need. She needed to see it up close for herself. She needed to experience it. She needed to be a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Or did she?<br>
<br>
She didn't, technically, need to be here in the mailgirls locker room in Jersey City, naked and on her knees as a diminutive Japanese woman paced back and forth in front of her. Erin O'Neill had been so sure of herself for the past few weeks, and so confident that she could go through with this. Visitor D, on the other hand, felt none of that confidence - only self-doubt and fear of what was coming. Why had she wanted to do this? Why had she needed to do this? Why had she done this to Ben?<br>
<br>
She shook the thought of her husband from her head, and focused blankly on an invisible spot on the floor a few feet in front of her. Thinking about him, and questioning the decisions that had brought her to this point, didn't help. She'd be better served to simply submit, and to roll with whatever came her way today. Erin O'Neill was a continent away, a happily married schoolteacher who'd built a life for herself in Southern California. It was Visitor D on her knees before Mistress Rei. It was Visitor D whose nipples stood straight-out and almost painfully erect. It was Visitor D who was already getting wet from all of this.<br>
<br>
The decision had been made. The hand had been raised. The clothes had been surrendered.<br>
<br>
She was a mailgirl now.<br>
<br>
The visitors, nine in all, had been told to arrive at Park Place before three o'clock that afternoon. But, after being stripped and blindfolded, they'd been left in lobby until well after four. They were a Christmas gift, in a way, to USF employees emptying out of the building for the holiday break. Erin had been blindfolded. But that had only served to make her sense of hearing keener, and she'd heard every comment offered in the direction of the naked line-up of mailgirl visitors - every snide remark, every cruel assessment of their naked bodies, every teasing "Merry Christmas!"<br>
<br>
The collars were snapped into place before the blindfolds were removed. Erin wondered if she'd been fitted incorrectly, and fought the urge to speak up and complain that hers might be a little too tight.<br>
<br>
When the blindfolds did finally come off, the naked line of visitors found that they'd been shackled to one another; each collar was linked to the next by a few short feet of industrial-looking chain. Visitor J, the last girl to arrive, was tugged to her feet by her hair, and pulled in the direction of the stairs in that fashion, without Mistress Rei bothering to release her grip. The others followed behind, shuffling behind one another. The length of chain from one girl's collar to the next wasn't long enough for them to take normal steps. Erin was careful not to step on Catherine's heels. And, she could feel Visitor C's warm breath on her own naked back.<br>
<br>
The stairs to the basement had been decorated with picture frame after picture frame filled with women's underwear. These were the trophies that USF so proudly displayed, the underthings of the kennel of naked slaves the company now kept just off the employee cafeteria. Whereas the mailgirls at the Plaza had been forced to surrender only that pair of panties they'd happened to be wearing the day they signed their contract with Human Capital, the girls of Park Place had surrendered and been forced display the entire contents of their lingerie drawers. USF took ownership of everything that belonged to the Park Place girls - their wardrobe, their furniture, their keepsakes and other worldly possessions - and stashed most of at another facility somewhere along the New York/New Jersey border. They'd sent a crew to fetch Sarah Scott's things from New Haven. They'd sent another to LA to retrieve Sophie's. And now, every pair of briefs, every thong, and every g-string were all hung like hides on the wall of a hunting lodge.<br>
<br>
Erin wondered how the décor had been received by USF's non-mailgirl population. After all, this was still a place that did mutual funds and brokerage accounts. Whatever was being done to the roster of junior execs roped into the mailgirls program, the company as a whole hadn't transformed into a sex dungeon or a human-trafficking auction house.<br>
<br>
They were led through an empty cafeteria, and Erin got her first look at the so-called mailgirls locker room on the far side of large, floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows. Though it served as both locker room and dormitory for Park Place's mailgirls, it was devoid of lockers or bedding; Erin doubted she was the first to note the irony. Through a heavy metal door and down an empty service corridor, they were led into the locker room itself and got an up-close and personal look.<br>
<br>
The windows facing in from the cafeteria were one-way only. On this side, they were mirrors. The locker room's occupants were treated only to their own reflections, but Erin doubted the girls rarely forgot about the viewing room on the other side. Six showerheads had been installed against this wall, emerging from the mirror as if floating freely in the center of a much larger room. To either side were counters with three sinks each, and only a single row of drawers stretching laterally beneath them provided any coverage or shielding to the cafeteria beyond.<br>
<br>
Opposite the showers, on the far wall, were the infamous washikis that Erin understood USF had installed as an experiment here at Park Place. There was entire subsection on the forum at the Post Office devoted to pictures of girls peeing in these sorts of things, and using the "squirting bidet" feature afterwards. Most came courtesy of a particularly industrious amateur photojournalist at Finder-Spyder in San Francisco; each and every member of that dot.com's roster had a few dozen pissing pictures now floating around on the Web. There'd been a handful of the USF girls, though, too. Not of Sarah. But Sophie was featured in a few. Erin had clicked out of the forum as quickly as she could after that discovery, and erased her browser history as an added precaution. She might not have been able to fully explain why she wanted to visit to Ben, but she absolutely, absolutely didn't want to have to explain why she'd needed to see pictures of her stepsister emptying her bladder. It was a fetish for some, to be sure, but not one that Erin needed to explore. She'd already ventured further down into the basement of her own psyche than she'd ever thought she would.<br>
<br>
Erin couldn't see them from here, but she knew from her research that there was a pair of regular toilets tucked around the corner. They weren't shielded from each other - there was no partition between them - but they were out of the line-of-sight of the cafeteria and any audience that might have been gathered there. Despite the fact that just about everything else seemed to be on the table when it came to humiliating the mailgirls, coprophilia was apparently a kink too far for the corporate masters at USF.<br>
<br>
The locker room was divided in two by a line of large, round eye-hooks that stretched from one wall the other. They were thick, black, and metal, made from the same thick, black metal that now adorned Erin's neck. There were twelve in total, and most had two stretches of chain - identical to one another, and identical to the chain that linked Erin to Catherine, and Catherine to Angela Giannini in front of her - coiled neatly and tightly beside it. Leashes. At the Plaza, Sarah had been leashed to her locker when not on duty. Here at Park Place, the girls were leashed to the floor.<br>
<br>
Or, apparently, the ceiling. Erin swallowed hard when she saw another row of eye-hooks installed in the ceiling above, mirroring the twelve below. She hadn't read about these before. Their very presence was menacing.<br>
<br>
The girls had been led into the locker room from the service corridor on one end, and Erin saw that there was another door on the far end, as well. To one side of both doors was an eight-foot metal trough, the preferred mailgirls feeding dish here in Jersey City. Dog collars and dog leashes were accompanied by dog bowls at USF Plaza; at Park Place, the girls were fed like sows.<br>
<br>
Or, gerbils? Above the troughs, spaced evenly and affixed to the walls, were four large water bottles, not unlike those found in gerbil or hamster or guinea pig cages the world over. With the spout placed at approximately waist-height, the suggestive nature of the drinking apparatuses was readily apparent. A mailgirl couldn't even get a drink of water without dropping to her knees and performing near-fellatio on the sipping tube. These, as Erin had read online, had been installed only a few weeks earlier, but had replaced the dog bowls throughout the building. A mailgirl from the Bay Area, whose company had rolled out the same thing there, sang their praise; it may have looked like she was giving head, but she could now take a drink of water without sticking her ass in the air. That, and it also stopped the apparently all-too-common occurrence on non-mailgirls spitting in the mailgirls' water supply.<br>
<br>
And that was it. This was the entirety of Park Place's mailgirls locker room. The girls were on-duty twelve hours a day, Erin supposed. But that still meant they were off-duty twelve hours a day, and spent those off-hours here in this sparse and spartan dungeon. She knew they got some time off at the end of each week to "blow off steam" in one of the employee lounges, and she knew that that Sarah - alone among the mailgirls - had been granted a block of time on Sundays for her "research" up in HR. But any breaks, any time after hours, and really any time they weren't asleep, were spent here in this prison.<br>
<br>
Was it any wonder they'd turned to masturbation and cunnilingus to pass the time? Simply, forgetting everything else, to fend off boredom?<br>
<br>
A shiver went up Erin's spine.<br>
<br>
She was on her knees on the far side of the row of eye-hooks, hands behind her back, and facing the wall of mirror glass, in the standard mailgirls "Resting" position. The girl staring back at her, in her reflection, was hardly recognizable. It was Erin O'Neill - Erin Ryan O'Neill - of course. Brown hair, slender frame, school-of-fish tattoo. But this Erin O'Neill, Visitor D, was from a mirror universe. A porn star. A slave girl. An animal. Only yesterday, Erin had dismissed her last English-11 class for Christmas break, and had somehow been replaced by this naked mailgirl, trembling with anticipation as her new mistress paced back and forth in front of her.<br>
<br>
"We took our last break a little early today," Mistress Rei was explaining, "so the girls won't be back here until seven." She spoke with an accent that clearly identified her as Japanese, but with a confidence and forcefulness that dismissed the idea she was any sort of submissive and docile geisha girl. She wore a long, form-hugging black dress with a plunging V-neckline that exposed more of her chest than it hid, and which sported a dangerous, thigh-high split up one leg. And she wore an improbable-looking pair of black, five-inch stiletto heels that gave her even more height on the line of naked girls kneeling before her. The ensemble, in its entirety, seemed out-of-place in this setting; she very well could have been heading off to or coming back from a black-tie holiday party somewhere in Manhattan.<br>
<br>
"That," she purred, "gives us a little time to get to know each other." She paused in front of the first girl in the line, Visitor A, and cupped her chin. As they locked eyes, she went on. "Some of you are regulars, and have gone through this more than once. And some of you have been here once or twice before. But most of you are virgins to my locker room. And none of you have belonged to me this long. Or for a holiday. Or for any amount of time that my girls have gotten this much freedom from their regular responsibilities.<br>
<br>
"The mailgirls will be off duty from seven tonight until seven in the morning on the 26th. There is no formal Evening Shift tonight, but I'm asking everyone - including you all - to make sure this locker room is spotless after the girls clean themselves up following their shifts this afternoon. Mopping. Scrubbing. Washing the toilets. I want everything so clean you could eat off the floor. Because," she added with a smile, "you might just have to."<br>
<br>
She continued down the line, gently petting each girl as she went. Erin braced for the woman's caress.<br>
<br>
"The mailgirls will be off duty, but there will still be check-ins expected of them, and they will still be expected to follow their standard code of conduct and keep their 'uniforms' up to the minimum standards. As their guests, you will all be expected to be present at these check-ins, and you will follow all of these same rules and restrictions.<br>
<br>
"You will not be issued smartphones or sleeves. But the girls themselves will be wearing them for the duration of your visit, when out of the locker room. Each one of you has been set up in the app, the same as any regular mailgirl, and linked to the profiles of your specific 'host.' Any demerits a girl is awarded will be awarded to you, as well. Any demerits you earn for your behavior will be awarded to your mailgirl. Any corrective actions suffered by your mailgirl, you will suffer along with them."<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei glanced down at the tablet she carried in one hand. Flipping through it, she called out, "Visitors H and I? You both will be joining our Mailgirl Number 11 for just such a correction this evening."<br>
<br>
Erin heard a whimper from one of the girls down the line.<br>
<br>
"Visitor F?" Mistress Rei smirked, and found Angela. "Welcome back. You, too."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mistress," Angela responded. There was no trepidation in her voice. She was to be spanked - or paddled, or whipped, or otherwise punished - for demerits her daughter had earned before she'd even arrived.<br>
<br>
"The rest of you? It looks like you will all be little more than spectators at this point. But there is still - " she checked the clock on the tablet, "- more than two hours left for your mailgirls to accumulate demerits while on active duty. And bear in mind that they, and you, can still earn demerits even while off duty."<br>
<br>
Erin breathed a sigh of relief. No spankings for her. At least, none scheduled. Not yet. She thought back to the redhead in the stocks in the lobby, though. Perhaps there were worse punishments than a few spanks to her backside.<br>
<br>
"You will also be required to provide data for our Human Capital team. You will find this to be embarrassing. You will want to withhold this data. You will, however, comply. Heights, weights, measurements. You provided these as part of visitor applications. We will need to verify. Any sessions of self-pleasure are to be logged. Sessions with a partner. Oral. Vaginal. Anal. Length of each session. Intensity, on scale from one to five. Orgasms - count them."<br>
<br>
Erin blushed all over. Masturbating in the company of her stepmother and stepsisters was unthinkable. And yet every piece of literature she'd come across in her mailgirl research assured her that it was a foregone conclusion. Self-control was not a strong suit among the girls who'd volunteered to become mailgirls. Sexual excitement was, after all, one of the primary reasons they were all here. The money helped. Promises of career advancement were regularly part of standard mailgirl contracts. But mailgirls were mailgirls because they got off on being mailgirls. It was what had brought Erin here to USF, wasn't it?<br>
<br>
In a twisted way, the sexual self-discovery and self-exploration mailgirl advocates often spoke of happened in a "safe" environment. There were programs, of course, in which each and every hole a mailgirl had was put into good use. Some companies had even dropped the ruse of having them deliver the mail altogether, and turned their volunteers into nothing more than sex slaves chained up in basement for "employee use." "Providing relief" was a term tossed around so much that it had entered the corporate lexicon. But, most of the mainstream programs abided by a "look-but-don't-touch" policy when it came to their mailgirls, and punishments were often swift and severe when it came to violations of that policy. USF, for all the awful things the company inflicted upon its girls, was reportedly safely on the right side of that policy. Erin hadn't had to worry about being bent over someone's desk and gang-banged by an entire department, and neither had she been forced to tell Ben she'd be "providing relief" as part of her trip to New Jersey.<br>
<br>
With those policies firmly in place, and strictly enforced, mailgirls were allowed be sexually objectified, and to sexually objectify themselves, without becoming full-blown fuck-toys. Masturbation was so common that it was practically synonymous with the mailgirl concept at that point - it was behavior expected of the exhibitionist mail-sluts in the quote-unquote "privacy" of their locker rooms. Out-and-out lesbian sex among the mailgirls themselves, at least publicly at work, was frowned upon, but understood to be rampant among the girls while off-duty. USF had reconsidered this position for their Park Place girls, given their 24/7 status, and chosen to "look the other way," so long as this last particular indulgence took place after hours.<br>
<br>
Erin had promised Sarah she'd make herself as scarce as possible, should Sarah feel the need strike her to touch herself. Catherine had warned her to do the same, if and when Sarah or Sophie needed to "address the issue." Erin wasn't sure she was ready to see either of her stepsisters tongue-deep between the legs of another girl, but the possibility of it occurring wasn't off the table.<br>
<br>
Erin had told Ben she herself would "be good." She'd try, at least. She had self-control enough that she'd be able to make it through forty-some hours without touching herself. Park Place would be largely deserted over the holiday, but it wasn't impossible to think a photo of her might wind up somewhere out on the Internet; she'd seen more than a few of other girls over the last few months. She didn't need to pile the additional humiliation of getting caught with her hands between her legs on top. But, less than two hours in, she'd already begun to wonder if she was capable of staying resolute in the face of her growing arousal.<br>
<br>
She'd gone three days without masturbating before, of course. Not recently. Not since she'd been sucked in the world of mailgirls online that Fall. And certainly not since Thanksgiving, when she'd made up mind to come visit her stepsisters here in New Jersey. She'd put Ben to good use over that same stretch, and she was sure that his reluctant acceptance of her fantasy had something to with realizing how much she was getting off on it.<br>
<br>
But she didn't think she was so lost that she couldn't "be good" until she got home.<br>
<br>
Sophie, apparently, hadn't been able to make it through the two hours Catherine had visited in September. While warning her stepdaughter that she was going to see "behavior" in Sarah and Sophie that Erin might find startling, Catherine confessed that she and Sarah had caught up in the cafeteria while Sophie "took care of business" on the other side of the mirror glass before joining them. Catherine had waved it off as uncomfortable, but understandable; after all, the girls had just gotten off one of their shifts when Catherine arrived for her visit. "It's natural," Catherine had admitted, resignation in her voice.<br>
<br>
Catherine herself had lingered in the shower that afternoon back in their hotel room, longer than Erin felt necessary to soap up her body and shampoo her hair. "Taking care of business," Erin assumed. She regretted having showered first, and having not thought of doing the same.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei continued her pacing, continued her speechifying, and continued to ever-so-gently run her hands through the girls' hair, to touch their cheeks, to teasingly caress their naked shoulders and backs. The "look-but-don't-touch" policy didn't, apparently, extend to the mailgirls' mistress, and the Japanese woman got bolder and bolder as time went on. She casually reached for, tweaked, and played with one of Erin's nipples. She inserted her index finger into Angela's mouth, and the older woman playfully wrapped her lips around it - lightly and subtly fellating, as she seemed to be expected to do.<br>
<br>
Erin drifted in and out. Nothing Mistress Rei was saying wasn't in the packet Human Capital had sent over as part of the agreement. Nothing was new, from what Erin had read online. And so, in addition to the wanton slave girl sporting "VD" on her hip, Erin began to take in her fellow visitors.<br>
<br>
Angela, Visitor F, was the oldest, by a pretty healthy margin. Catherine was probably next, but she was in much better shape than Visitor G, who was a little pudgy around the midsection and whose sagging breasts had seen better days. The rest of the girls were in their late twenties or early thirties, Erin guessed - right around her own age, and right around the ages of most of the actual mailgirls. She supposed that made sense - Catherine, Angela, and Visitor G were the mothers, while the other six girls were likely friends, sisters, or cousins. Sophie Scott, at twenty-three, was a bit of an outlier among the mailgirls here at USF, as the company typically targeted young professionals, but not straight-out-of-college volunteers like some companies did. Visitor B, a stunning but nervous-looking blonde, looked to be about that age.<br>
<br>
Erin pegged Visitor A as a lesbian, given her short brown hair and the way her eyes roamed the reflections of the other girls. That was probably an unfair assumption, seeing as how Erin was doing the exact same thing, but she'd always had good "gay-dar." The lines would likely be blurred, however, when it came to the mailgirls, among whom the "letter-carrying lesbian" thing was a real and recognized phenomenon, and among whom sexuality was known to be much more fluid.<br>
<br>
Visitors H and I were together. Mistress Zero had more-or-less confirmed this assumption when informing them of their impending spanking. They were both young and good-looking, attractive enough that either one of them could have been actual mailgirls in USF's actual program, even with the company's reputation for selecting only the best-of-the-best. Visitor B was in a category all her own, but Erin might have lumped herself in with H and I as close runners-up. Might have, if it weren't for the tattoo, of which she was suddenly self-conscious.<br>
<br>
Rounding them out was Visitor C, the girl who'd arrived just before Catherine and Erin, and the only of them to have arrived with a patch of pubic hair still in place. Quebecois, Erin guessed now, placing the accent. French-Canadian. Or American, with French roots?<br>
<br>
All of them, even Visitor G, were beauties. Catherine and Angela were on the older end of the spectrum, to be sure, but they both wore their age gracefully and easily would have turned the heads of much younger men. Erin supposed this, too, made sense; given the reputation of USF's mailgirls ranks, it stood to reason that USF's mailgirls came from similarly attractive stock. Even Visitor G looked to have been pretty in her day. She was still pretty, in fact. She only suffered in comparison.<br>
<br>
"...from twelve to four," Mistress Zero was explaining, and Erin snapped back to attention. What had she said?<br>
<br>
"Male visitors will be allowed only in the lobby and the cafeteria," she carried on. "These are not conjugal visits. There is to be no inappropriate contact. Not from the mailgirls. Not from you. Punishment will be severe. And communal."<br>
<br>
Male visitors? Male visitors?!! Erin wasn't prepared for this. Though the duration of her visit would be long, from Christmas Eve through Boxing Day, part of the appeal had been the idea that Park Place would be more-or-less deserted for the holiday. Mailgirls, visitors, and security personnel only. She'd used that argument as a selling point to Ben. She'd used that argument as a selling point to herself. There'd be a limited audience here or there - like when she'd undressed when she first got here, or when she'd have to get dressed again on the morning of the 26th. But it wasn't as if USF would be fully staffed over Christmas, and it wasn't as if she'd be running deliveries through crowded cubicles with Sarah and Sophie.<br>
<br>
She hadn't factored in male visitors. Catherine's first husband wanted nothing to do with Sarah and Sophie. Patrick, certainly, had no interest in visiting. Somehow, this had been a blank spot for Erin, so focused as she'd been on the hoops female visitors would be expected to jump through that she hadn't even stopped to consider that the mailgirls might have male visitors stopping by for Christmas, too.<br>
<br>
Erin grimaced. There wasn't anything she could do about it now. She could only hope that the other girls' male family members were as squeamish about all this as her own father and Tom Scott were.<br>
<br>
She took a deep breath and steeled herself. She was being ridiculous. She'd just stripped naked in front of who-knew-how-many men in the lobby, and fully expected to be similarly fucked-with and embarrassed on the morning of the 26th, when she and Catherine would be allowed to finally get dressed again. Ramirez, and any other other male security guards, were sure to get a peek over the next couple of days. And Erin knew full-well that there were cameras everywhere. Besides which, wasn't being seen part of the pull? Exhibitionist fantasies weren't truly exhibitionist without a proper audience.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei continued on, and Erin lost herself once more in her own reflection. The mailgirls' mistress - Erin's mistress - ran through the do's and don'ts, the rules and restrictions, the punishments and the consequences. She got them all up on their feet, up on their toes, back down to their knees, and then all the way down and on all fours. And then up again. And down again. And up again. And down again. "Knees," "Feet," and "Toes," were the positions they'd be assuming the most. But Mistress Rei made them grab their ankles. She made them sit Indian-style on the floor. She got them into squats. It was like a yoga class, only with the instructor screaming and screeching at her students and letting her hands wander into all sorts of intimate places. Erin couldn't say she'd ever had someone use their finger to trace little circles around her naked asshole before.<br>
<br>
When it came time for their first bathroom break, Erin got her courage up and went for it without hesitating. She squatted, with Visitor A on one side and Visitor B on the other, while Catherine and Angela engaged in whispered conversation and looked away. There was no toilet paper, however, and it took Erin some fumbling to figure out the washiki's bidet feature. Nor were there paper towels when she went to wash her hands afterwards, and Erin was forced to follow the lead of Visitor A and dry her hands off on the outside of her bare thighs.<br>
<br>
"I can't believe I'm doing this," Erin said in the other girl's direction, after a glance over her shoulder at Mistress Rei. She wasn't sure if she was allowed to speak.<br>
<br>
"This is your first time?" Visitor A asked.<br>
<br>
"It is. You've done this before?"<br>
<br>
"I'm here every weekend," the girl replied. "Ever since my girlfriend buckled and came crawling back."<br>
<br>
Girlfriend. Erin nodded. Score another one for her gay-dar.<br>
<br>
"The first time is definitely the hardest," Visitor A went on. "And it's not the 'being naked' part. You'll be over that in an hour or two, once you get used to it."<br>
<br>
"I don't know..."<br>
<br>
"You'll be fine. It's the rest of it. The sub-human part of it. Being a plaything for the assholes in Human Capital. It's hard on the visitors. The other girls know their place by now."<br>
<br>
"...'know their place'...?"<br>
<br>
"Lowest of the low," Visitor A responded. She tilted her head towards Mistress Rei. "Whatever it is, just do it. It's easier. And it's easier on whomever you're visiting."<br>
<br>
"One and Two."<br>
<br>
"One and Two. If you fight it, or if you call 'mercy' and walk out, One and Two are going to get the brunt of it."<br>
<br>
"So...why do you keep coming back?"<br>
<br>
Visitor A gave it a moment's thought, and then shrugged. "For Sixteen. I don't want her to go through this on her own."<br>
<br>
Erin nodded. She followed the other girl back towards the center of the room, to they eye-hooks.<br>
<br>
Visitor A reconsidered her answer, though. "No, that's not it. Not anymore." She got a distant look in her eye. "I'm not sure I can explain it. Despite everything, it's better in here. Easier. Clearer. And...fuck...I don't know. It's better. The sex is better. And hotter."<br>
<br>
Erin cocked an eyebrow. "But you're not a mailgirl, yourself?"<br>
<br>
Visitor A chuckled. "No. I've got a boring office job, 9-to-5. Product manager for a biotech company. No mailgirls there. Yet."<br>
<br>
"But your girlfriend...?"<br>
<br>
"Was in Trade Ops here. Before. Before the company came after her, and made her life a living fucking hell when she turned them down the first time."<br>
<br>
"But she came back?"<br>
<br>
"She came back. She surrendered."<br>
<br>
"She volunteered?"<br>
<br>
"Quote, unquote. They're all 'volunteers.' Quote, unquote." There was bitterness in the way Visitor A explained it, but it was bitterness that sounded worn down.<br>
<br>
"But she agreed to it, right? And you keep coming back."<br>
<br>
The other girl sighed. "She agreed to it. And I keep coming back. Be careful. This shit lays it all out there. It's not just your tits and ass that get exposed. It gets its claws into you, and you can't not do it. You can't not think about it. If you're here, and you're doing this now - voluntarily, like for-real volunteering - you probably already know."<br>
<br>
"I do. I think I do."<br>
<br>
"The Blackstockings would call it being 'sexually realized.' Personally, I think it's just owning up to how damaged we all are."<br>
<br>
Damaged. That wasn't how Erin saw herself, was it?<br>
<br>
Was it?<br>
<br>
There was truth there, though. Why else had Erin wanted to come so badly?<br>
<br>
"Like I said," the lesbian repeated, "be careful. You start getting your rocks off this way, and it's hard to go back. The only thing keeping half the girls in here from sucking off all comers or becoming full-on prostitutes are the rules Human Capital threw up."<br>
<br>
Erin was soon back on her knees for Mistress Rei, and the corporate dominatrix continued on with her orientation and indoctrination. Because it was Christmas Eve, the girls were being granted an extra-special night out of the locker room, and would be allowed drinks and revelry-of-sorts up in an employee lounge on the second floor. They'd have the run of Human Resources, but Mistress Rei warned them that most of the rules still applied - no going into offices, no going through people's desks, no sitting on the furniture. If they made a mess, of any sort, they were clean it up. And when it came time to bed down for the night, they were to return here, and lock themselves up with one of the leashes.<br>
<br>
"Use the potty first," Mistress Rei warned them. "I'm not coming back for you until six tomorrow morning."<br>
<br>
Training, such as it was, was complete when the first of the actual mailgirls began trickling in through one of the side entrances. The girl, marked as Number Ten, was a big-chested dirty blonde, wearing the standard mailgirl attire of a collar and a black armband. But, just as the redhead in the lobby had been decorated for the holiday with a Santa's hat, Mailgirl Number Ten sported a set of reindeer antlers sprouting from some sort of hairband. Erin wondered about the practicalities of keeping such a hairpiece in place when sprinting through the building.<br>
<br>
Mailgirl Number Four was next through the door - another gorgeous specimen, this one a brunette, this one sporting reindeer antlers of her own. Neither Ten nor Four appeared to have any visitors present, however. As Mistress Rei told the visitors they could rise and "make themselves comfortable," she pulled Ten aside, handed her a set of keys, and put her in charge of unlocking Visitors A through I. She herself departed with another set, announcing to the room that she was going to go fetch Mailgirl Number Six from the lobby. There was still trepidation on the part of the newcomers, but every one them seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when the Japanese woman was gone.<br>
<br>
Visitors H and I belonged to Mailgirl Number Eleven, who squealed in delight and shouted, "Shut up!" at the top of her lungs. "No fucking way!" She bounded towards them and embraced them both, showing no sense of shame over the naked hug. Her visitors were more stiff, and awkward, not prepared for the skin-on-skin contract. There was no family resemblance, Erin thought to herself. Friends, she assumed.<br>
<br>
Angela's daughter, Mailgirl Number Fourteen, was next. Greetings were largely one-sided, however, as the girl - dark hair and Mediterranean features - had a ball gag in her mouth. Angela couldn't help but laugh at her daughter's plight, cackling at the sight and taking hold of her in long, warm, maternal hug. Fourteen was a few inches shorter than her mother, but she had the same build, the same high cheekbones, the same nose, and even the same hips; looking at her was like looking at Angela herself - just a younger, tighter model.<br>
<br>
"Can you even breathe with that thing on?" Angela laughed.<br>
<br>
Fourteen's response was muffled. But she nodded, made a show of breathing through her nose, and then shrugged. She was practiced, she seemed to be telling her mother.<br>
<br>
"Can I take it off?" Angela asked, and began to fiddle with the latch at the back.<br>
<br>
Fourteen shook her head. "Ih-uh Ay." Mistress Rei. Only Mistress Rei could take it off.<br>
<br>
"I wish I had my camera," Angela joked. "This would be a hell of a Christmas card!"<br>
<br>
Fourteen wasn't the only mailgirl to have been fitted with extra "equipment." All the girls had on headgear, whether red Santa's hats, green elf hats, or brown reindeer antlers. Mailgirl Number Seventeen wore a red garter belt and a pair of stockings decorated with candy-canes. Sarah, the first of the Scott girls through the door, wore a similar pair of ornaments as Erin had seen on the redhead in the lobby - green and red, covered in glitter, and dangling from her nipples. They bounced as she walked over to where Catherine and Erin were waiting with anticipation.<br>
<br>
"Sorry," she apologized as she hugged her mother. The ornaments were in the way. Catherine paid them no mind, and only squeezed her daughter tighter. "Mom...you're going to break them."<br>
<br>
Catherine pulled back, and slapped Sarah's cheek. It was light and playful, and didn't make a sound. "Per Human Capital," she announced mockingly, "I am to be called by my mail room visitor's designation."<br>
<br>
Sarah smirked, and looked to her mother's hip. "Visitor E, then?"<br>
<br>
"It's what it says."<br>
<br>
Sarah found Erin's next. "And Visitor D?"<br>
<br>
Erin was nervous. Sophie had been enthusiastic in her support of Erin's visit. Sarah? Maybe not so much. Erin had felt judged for even bringing it up, and Sarah had done her best to talk her stepsister out of it. But the smile, and the hug that accompanied it, were sincere. The baubles hanging from Sarah's chest were, indeed, in the way, and they felt scratchy against Erin's skin. A spark of electricity shot through her as her nipples - still erect - brushed against her Sarah's body.<br>
<br>
She pulled back, sheepishly. A look from Sarah spoke volumes. She knew.<br>
<br>
"I can't believe you're here," Sarah said, shaking her head.<br>
<br>
"I wanted to be," Erin answered honestly.<br>
<br>
"I can't believe Ben let you come. After you told him?!!"<br>
<br>
"I didn't give him a lot of choice."<br>
<br>
Sarah sized her up, and met Erin's eyes. "We'll talk about this later," Mailgirl Number Two seemed to be telling her. Along with something else. Was that...lust? Libido? Erin's gay-dar was going off.<br>
<br>
"Well, you looking amazing," Sarah complimented her. She absently reached for her nipples, and gently massaged her areolae around the clamps. "I can't wait to get these idiot things off." She slowed for a moment, as if realizing what she was doing. But she didn't stop.<br>
<br>
"He's in Santa Barbara?" Sarah asked, continuing on with the conversation, as if she weren't playing with herself.<br>
<br>
"Stop that," her mother chided her. "It's weird."<br>
<br>
Sarah stuck out her tongue. "It's weird," she admitted. "Tip of the iceberg."<br>
<br>
Erin jumped in, uncomfortably. "He's in Santa Barbara. He was driving up this afternoon. His sister's in town with her husband and their kids. Staying at his mom's house. So, big O'Neill Family Christmas."<br>
<br>
"And Patrick?" she asked her mother. "Fishing? Did you come clean this time?"<br>
<br>
Catherine shook her head. "Fishing? Yes. He's with Phil and Jack. Did I come clean? No."<br>
<br>
"He's going to find out..."<br>
<br>
"He'd prefer not to know," Catherine replied, nipping that line of questioning in the bud.<br>
<br>
Sarah glanced around the room. "She's not back yet?" Meaning, Sophie.<br>
<br>
"Not yet," Catherine said.<br>
<br>
"I haven't seen her much since lunch. We passed each other on the stairs earlier this afternoon, but other than that..."<br>
<br>
Sarah's ministrations upon her breasts came to stop, and she took one of Erin's hands in hers. "Seriously, I can't believe you came. I can't believe you're doing this."<br>
<br>
"I just..."<br>
<br>
"I know. I know. I'm sorry if I was a bitch about it."<br>
<br>
Erin hadn't known her stepsister to swear. But then, given everything that had transpired in Sarah's life since the two had last seen each other, Erin supposed she hadn't really known who her stepsister was.<br>
<br>
"No, no," she brushed the apology off. "Not at all. You were just looking out for me."<br>
<br>
"I was. I mean, I was. Mostly. Part of it, though? You're not really going to see me at my best."<br>
<br>
It was now Erin's turn to drink in her stepsister's naked body. Sarah had always been attractive, but she'd Clark Kent-ed her way through life without really-and-truly tipping her hand at what lay beneath her clothes. She had long blonde hair, flowing behind her and tied up in a ponytail. Spotless skin, with a healthy-looking tan that was likely courtesy of some sort of tanning booth here in building. A gorgeous, mischievous smile. The brightest of blue eyes. Her breasts were not much smaller than Erin's own, but were absolutely perfect - Christmas ornaments notwithstanding. And she looked as if she'd lost weight; she was firm, tight, and positively sculpted around her hips and her ass. Running errands at USF in her birthday suit had taken a girl with a model's looks and somehow ratcheted the whole presentation up to another level.<br>
<br>
"If this isn't your best..." Erin began. "You look amazing, yourself."<br>
<br>
Sarah gave her an aww-shucks look, and released her hand. "Not really what I meant," she said. "Though, thank you. I meant more...um...behavior-wise."<br>
<br>
"It's not you," Erin assured her. "It's the job."<br>
<br>
It was the wrong thing to say, and Erin knew it the moment she said it. She was trying to be polite, and excuse the inevitable lewd acts that Sarah would need to engage in over the next few days, those same acts that she and Sarah had danced around over the phone. Because the truth of it was that it wasn't the job; the job had only provided an opportunity for the true Sarah Scott to show herself.<br>
<br>
Sarah looked away, briefly. "Maybe," was all she allowed, the response pregnant with deeper emotions.<br>
<br>
"It's fine," Erin told her. "Really. No judgment. No judgment here. I'm here now, too."<br>
<br>
"I'm glad you're here," Sarah said, genuinely. "I do appreciate it. It's a little escape. Makes me feel almost human again."<br>
<br>
"I wish we could have brought presents," Catherine interrupted.<br>
<br>
"A vibrator would have been nice," the mailgirl joked impishly. "Am I allowed to say that sort of thing in front of my mother?"<br>
<br>
"I could have brought mine?" Catherine returned.<br>
<br>
"Ew, ew, ew!" Sarah laughed. "Gross. Okay, there are lines."<br>
<br>
Catherine kissed her daughter on the cheek. "I've been here before, remember? I get it. No need to self-censor. I'm not just another tool to embarrass you or make you feel bad about this."<br>
<br>
That, of course, was the very purpose of the visitor's program. Just when a girl couldn't humiliate herself anymore in front of former peers and coworkers, Human Capital opened the doors to friends and family.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, we'll see," Sarah replied. "I could use a shower, actually. I'm still a little salty from earlier this afternoon."<br>
<br>
Was "shower" code for masturbation? Erin wasn't sure.<br>
<br>
"Have you been busy today?" the brunette asked.<br>
<br>
Sarah shook her head. "No. This morning, yes. They had us delivering candy canes and handing out presents." She cringed. "And singing Christmas carols."<br>
<br>
"With your voice?" Catherine laughed. "Now, that's embarrassing!"<br>
<br>
"I know, right? Just when I thought I couldn't humiliate myself any further. But, no, it slowed down after lunch, and it's been dead since three or four or so. I've been up the 6th Floor, just waiting and waiting and waiting. In fact - I'm sorry - I need to pee."<br>
<br>
Any sense of shame had gone out of the naked blonde. Even as she squatted down over one of the washikis, she continued the conversation. "Oof, my knees," she complained.<br>
<br>
Erin glanced nervously at her stepmother.<br>
<br>
"Your knees?" Catherine answered, as casually as if she and Sarah were catching up over coffee. "I'm the one who's fifty years old."<br>
<br>
"Not yet, you're not," the squatting girl called back.<br>
<br>
"You've got to all have calluses on your kneecaps by now. Up, down, up, down."<br>
<br>
Sarah finished, used the bidet, and stood. She washed her hands, and then rubbed them dry on her buttocks. "You do get used to it. Comfortable even. It's like powering down, mentally." Sarah meant this as a selling point. "When I was in-town, and going home every night, I even started doing it there, in my own apartment. Like, at this point, I don't know if I've sat in an honest-to-goodness chair since this summer."<br>
<br>
"Well, you're not allowed to," Erin interjected.<br>
<br>
"We're not allowed to," Sarah corrected her. "You, too. But, yeah, still. It's just that it's rare that I'm stuck in one place for that long, like I was this afternoon. It was so, so nice to finally be able to stand and walk around."<br>
<br>
Erin heard a squeal behind her, and turned to see Sophie come skipping into the room. No nipple clamps for her, but she did have on a Santa's hat, and the same garter and candy cane stockings as Mailgirl Number Seventeen. Her feet, however, were poking through any number of rips and holes, and the stockings themselves would undoubtedly need to be retired after today.<br>
<br>
Sarah and Sophie weren't so similar in appearance that they'd be mistaken for twins, but there was no question they were sisters. The same blonde hair. The same lips and eyes and flawless skin. Sophie was a bit taller than Sarah, and her chest not quite as big. But she was every bit the looker, and Erin once again felt self-conscious about being measured against two such exquisite specimens as the Scott sisters.<br>
<br>
"Oh my god! I forgot about the tattoo!" Sophie laughed as she came in for a hug. It had been a year or two since Sophie and Erin had gotten together at the beach. They'd last seen each other in the Spring, for Sophie's bridal shower, but it hadn't exactly been bathing suit weather - even in California.<br>
<br>
Erin blushed. "It's going to get me a lot of attention?"<br>
<br>
"No, it's empty out there. I didn't pass a single person on my way up from downstairs. And besides - it looks good on you." She turned to her mother. She greeted her with mock formality. "Visitor E."<br>
<br>
"Mailgirl Number One," Catherine replied. She leaned in and hugged her youngest daughter. The hug lingered.<br>
<br>
Sarah and Sophie - Mailgirls Two and One, respectively - greeted each other next. "Where were you?" Sarah asked.<br>
<br>
"B2," Sophie answered, sticking out her tongue. "Eight and I got tasked with the panty hunt." To Erin, she teased, "Found yours, by the way."<br>
<br>
Erin groaned. It hadn't been Security, then, tasked with rifling through her luggage to steal her underwear. Nor Mistress Rei. Instead, it had been the mailgirls themselves. "Seriously?" Erin laughed. "You couldn't just have 'missed' them?"<br>
<br>
"Nuh-uh," Sophie grinned. "I'm not spending Christmas in the stocks in case someone goes back to check my work."<br>
<br>
Erin sighed with resignation. "All of them?"<br>
<br>
Her stepsister nodded. "All of them," she confirmed, apologetically. "Even the ones you hid in your jeans."<br>
<br>
"There's a Victoria's Secret in Newport Centre," Sarah offered. "For the trip home."<br>
<br>
"Me too?" Catherine asked.<br>
<br>
"You, too," Sophie said. "While I can't say I relished picking through my mother's underwear, I figured better me than Eight."<br>
<br>
"What do they even do with them? Do they get hung up somewhere? I had four pairs."<br>
<br>
"I don't know," Sophie shrugged.<br>
<br>
"Gifts," Sarah jumped in. "Prizes. Into some junior executive's jizz rag collection."<br>
<br>
Catherine gagged.<br>
<br>
"By the way," Sophie began, in her mother's direction, "what was with the-"<br>
<br>
"Shh," Catherine hushed her cryptically.<br>
<br>
Erin looked about the room. From end to end, it was awash with naked flesh. Some of the mailgirls - Five, Seven, Twelve, Fourteen - were greeting their guests, the same as Sarah and Sophie. There was some awkwardness, though more from the visitors than the mailgirls, as those visitors adjusted to hugging their loved ones in the nude. Visitor C was on the receiving end of some teasing, apparently, from Mailgirls Seven and Eight; the patch of hair between her legs stood out even more than Erin's tattoo. Now that she had more of an opportunity to look around, though, Erin saw she wasn't the only visitor with a little ink - one of Eleven's friends, Visitor H, was sporting a tribal-looking lower back tattoo of her own.<br>
<br>
But the showers were now going, too, and a few of those mailgirls who weren't playing host to the newcomers took the opportunity to wash and get clean before the showerheads were overrun. Mailgirl Number Nine had her back to the room, and was leaning with one hand up against her own reflection beneath the water. She didn't waste her time with soap or shampoo, though, just yet. Instead, she used her free hand to find her pussy, and began rubbing furiously and frantically.<br>
<br>
Erin knew she should look away, but couldn't help herself. She knew that this was part of the mailgirls experience, and that masturbation was both common and expected. She'd done her research; even companies that had initially tried to restrict the girls from doing so eventually caved and allowed it, as there didn't seem to be a punishment severe enough to keep their naughty little sluts from touching themselves. But understanding it and expecting it didn't mean that Erin was ready for the sight of another girl masturbating so brazenly and openly just a few feet away.<br>
<br>
There was no foreplay, no easing into it. Nine was fully primed the moment she stepped under the water, and the dark-haired girl barely even registered it when Mailgirl Number Nineteen stepped under the showerhead beside her.<br>
<br>
"Don't stare," Sarah told Erin. Erin blushed, and returned her attention to Catherine, Sarah, and Sophie.<br>
<br>
"Sorry," Erin mewed apologetically.<br>
<br>
"Or, stare, if you want to," Sophie jumped in, smiling. "She doesn't care. Some of us like the audience."<br>
<br>
"Stop it!" Catherine scolded her daughter gently, and pushed her playfully.<br>
<br>
Erin glanced back over her shoulder. Nine hadn't slowed, and Nineteen had now begun her own session of self-abuse.<br>
<br>
Sarah held up her hands, giving up. "All that, and more," she promised her visitors.<br>
<br>
There was a roar, and a smattering of applause, when Mistress Rei returned to the locker room with the redhead from the lobby. Mailgirl Number Six had been freed from her bondage, and looked worse for the wear. The gag, the ornaments, and the Santa's hat were all gone, but her red hair was a mess and she was noticeably tired. She still offered her fans a weak smile, however, and even a little curtsy.<br>
<br>
"What did she do?" Erin asked. "To get punished like that?"<br>
<br>
"She's a little gossip," Sarah chuckled. The name-calling wasn't catty at all. Sarah seemed to think it was funny. "We're having a few more visitors tonight - some of the girls from the Plaza - and Human Capital had wanted to keep it a surprise."<br>
<br>
"Do we know who?" Sophie asked her sister. "Did we find out?"<br>
<br>
"No," Sarah answered. "But I guarantee at least one of them is Plaza Seven. So probably Plaza Ten, too. And maybe Plaza Nineteen." She turned to her stepsister and her mother to explain. "The girls from the Plaza come visit every now and then. They usually get shipped over in a truck."<br>
<br>
"'Shipped'?" Catherine asked.<br>
<br>
"Same as the two of us," Sarah went on. "Like cargo."<br>
<br>
"Against their will?"<br>
<br>
"No. Well, the shipping part - yes, I guess, against their will. But I know a few of them weren't looking forward to going home for Christmas. So even being locked in here is better than being alone. Better company."<br>
<br>
"And the redhead - Six? - spoiled the surprise?" Erin asked.<br>
<br>
"She's still got friends in HR. Though, fewer." Sarah pointed out Mailgirl Number Eleven. "Eleven was a recruiter. And Eighteen was in Payroll. But somehow Six still finds out about this stuff before the rest of us."<br>
<br>
Sarah caught the eye of the only woman in the room in actual clothes. "Mistress Rei? May this mailgirl-"<br>
<br>
The Japanese woman cut her short with a hand wave. "Yes, go ahead." To Sophie, she said, "And the stockings, too, if you want. But I do have one last pick-up for the two of you."<br>
<br>
Sarah unhooked the ornaments from her chest, and handed them to her mistress. Sophie unsnapped the garter belt, rolled down her stockings, and gave them to Mistress Rei, as well. As Sarah massaged her sore nipples, Mistress Rei pointed at Erin and Catherine.<br>
<br>
"Take your visitors, too. I want you at the loading dock in..." She paused to punch something into her smartphone, and handed Sarah a bracelet with a set of keys. "...six minutes. Go, go, go!"<br>
<br>
Neither of the Scott girls said a word their guests. Only a look was needed to convey that Catherine and Erin were to follow behind. And were to haul ass. In a flash, all four were out the door, and were sprinting up the service corridor outside the mailgirls locker room.<br>
<br>
"It's eight minutes," Sophie complained. "At best."<br>
<br>
Sarah agreed with her. "I'm at twenty-two demerits. This is for them." Meaning, Catherine and Erin. Meaning, twenty-five was inevitable. Meaning, Catherine and Erin were going to end up over Mistress Rei's knee.<br>
<br>
Erin was a jogger - she had that going for her, at least. But running in spandex and trainers and a sports bra was far different than streaking naked and barefoot down a concrete hallway in the basement of a corporate office building. Each footfall landed heavily, and her breasts bounced wildly out of control. She wondered if she should have stretched. She wondered if Catherine was going to be able to keep up.<br>
<br>
Visitor E, though, kept pace with the rest of them.<br>
<br>
"The Plaza girls?" Sophie asked.<br>
<br>
"Has to be," Sarah panted.<br>
<br>
"She heard us?" Erin asked.<br>
<br>
"She hears everything."<br>
<br>
The interior of Park Place flew by the group at a blur, and Erin barely had time to take in her surroundings as she screamed past the picture frame after picture frame of women's underwear that adorned the walls. They were still in one of the service corridors - nothing but the cement floors and cinder block walls, broken up only by the questionable "artwork" and the occasional door. Even if it weren't Christmas Eve, Erin doubted that they'd have bumped into anyone but custodial staff or other mailgirls.<br>
<br>
The corridor stretched on forever, and only after the smartphones on two mailgirls' arms had begun blinking a furious shade of red did Sarah and Sophie take a turn and began to dash up a set of stairs.<br>
<br>
"Park Place is only six floors," Sophie explained, playing the tour guide. "Eight, including the basement levels. But it's fucking enormous."<br>
<br>
"No elevators for us," Sarah jumped in. She came to a stop at a heavy metal door marked with a large number one, announcing their arrival on the first floor. She took hold of the handle, waited a beat for the light on the security pad to the left of the door to go from red to green, and swung the door open. "It's - what? - twenty-some minutes from the corner of the 6th to far side of B2?"<br>
<br>
"Twenty-five," Sophie replied. "On a good day. Assuming no one's in the way and these locks cooperate."<br>
<br>
"The phones open the locks," Sarah explained. "They're supposed to, at least."<br>
<br>
"They do," Sophie agreed. "Unless Human Capital decides they want to screw with us."<br>
<br>
Elevators, as a general rule, were off-limits to mailgirls everywhere, worldwide. However, Erin understood that exceptions had had to be made when USF rolled out its program at the forty-eight-story Plaza downtown, and that those mailgirls were allowed the privilege of riding the service elevators if the floor count between deliveries got above a reasonable number. Here at Park Place, however, those exceptions apparently didn't apply.<br>
<br>
The foursome stepped out into another long hallway, and continued the sprint in the direction of the loading docks. This particular section of the trip felt more like a real office building, albeit slightly run-down. There was linoleum beneath Erin's feet now, and drywall to either side of her. They still passed the occasional set of panties hung on the wall, but these were interspersed with more traditional artwork - the same sort of banal, unobjectionable paintings that one would expect to be hung in more traditional places of work.<br>
<br>
Erin heard a vibration from the phone on Sarah's arm, and she knew they'd missed their deadline. Six minutes were up, and they weren't yet at their destination.<br>
<br>
Her eyes were wide with fear and anticipation. Around every corner, she expected to bump into someone wearing a suit and tie, or otherwise dressed for work. But her stepsister had been right - the building was dead. There was no one here at Park Place on Christmas Eve but the mailgirls themselves. Erin didn't know whether she felt relieved or disappointed.<br>
<br>
By the time the party pushed through the final door, and found themselves at the loading docks, Sarah's demerit count was safely on the far side of twenty-five. The display on her smartphone - a timer ticking first downwards towards zero, and then back up to show how late they were - was frozen in place. Erin put her hands on her head to catch her breath. Catherine bent at the midsection, as if preparing to collapse. The two Scott girls barely looked winded.<br>
<br>
The loading dock was a loading dock, nothing more. The girls stood inside a large, cavernous room flanked by metal shelves and unopened boxes. A forklift was slumbering behind them. Four large garage doors were closed tight; as they were poorly insulated, though, the room was chillier than rest of Park Place. If Erin's nipples hadn't already been hard, the temperature surely would have caused them to stiffen.<br>
<br>
At the center of the room were three pet carriers, stacked neatly and tightly in a pyramid - two on the floor, with a third on top. No different than Erin would have expected for a golden retriever or a Labrador going on a cross-country flight - only that these were human beings inside. Or, mailgirls, at least. The difference between mailgirls and canine occupants, however, was that no pet owner would have been so inhumane as to try to cram two dogs into a single carrier. As Erin approached the stack with her stepsisters and stepmother, she gasped in horror when she saw that two of them were doubly occupied, with two mailgirls each.<br>
<br>
Sarah bent and unlocked the crates, and a flood of naked limbs and naked torsos came tumbling out onto the loading dock's floor. Two girls emerged from the bottom crate on the left. Two emerged from the one on top. And a single occupant crawled from the last.<br>
<br>
Erin was shocked to see none other than Lindsey Czarniak untangle herself from a naked brunette, and rise to her feet before her. It wasn't the ESPN anchor, of course, but an uncanny doppelganger - one that Erin recognized instantly from the hours of SportsCenter she'd been forced to consume, thanks to Ben. Same short blonde hair. Same prominent nose. Same big, toothy smile unbroken by her recent captivity. She was, as any good mailgirl was, naked from head-to-toe, save for the same metal collar the girls here at Park Place all sported, and a bit of black ink that denoted her as "PL 7." The "PL" - signifying her as one of the "Plaza" girls, Erin surmised - was a little smudged, but looked like fresh ink. The "7," on the other hand, looked as if it had been traced and re-traced upon her hip a good half dozen times.<br>
<br>
Sarah greeted "PL 7" with a long and lingering hug.<br>
<br>
There were no more celebrity look-alikes among the other four girls who crawled from the pet carrier. Or, at least, none as evident as the sportscaster, or Angela Giannini's Rene Russo, or even maybe Mailgirl Number Eleven's Olivia Munn. The Plaza's number Seven was accompanied by, as Sarah had predicted, a girl marked as Number Ten. Numbers Seventeen and Eighteen crawled down from the carrier on top. Mailgirl Number Twenty-One was the one who'd ridden over in relative luxury, having an entire crate to herself.<br>
<br>
Jessica Chastain, Erin caught herself, and added that to her list. Mailgirl Number Six, here at Park Place, was Jessica Chastain. Or, close enough that it would have been Jessica Chastain playing her in the movie version - legs spread, sex exposed, and Christmas ornaments dangling from her breasts in the lobby.<br>
<br>
Sarah's hug with Plaza Seven eventually came to end, and Erin watched as her stepsister greeted the others. These were the girls with whom Sarah had spent the previous summer, members of the mailgirl sisterhood still serving at the pleasure of US Financial at the Plaza. It was only to Plaza Seventeen that Park Place Two needed an introduction; Plaza Seventeen, apparently, had joined the team after Sarah had been relocated out to Jersey City, and she was every bit the virgin to Park Place as Erin herself was. There was a warmth and a camaraderie present among them all. These girls were allowed to leave the Plaza and go home every night, while Sarah and Sophie served their 24/7 sentence at Park Place. And yet, they'd given up that opportunity in order to be locked in with their friends over Christmas.<br>
<br>
Introductions were made, though not a single girl was introduced to Erin O'Neill or Catherine Ryan. Rather, they were referred to only by their visitors' designations - Visitor D and Visitor E - just as the Plaza girls were introduced as Plaza Seven, Plaza Ten, Plaza Seventeen, and so on. Just as Sarah and Sophie introduced themselves to Plaza Seventeen as "Park Place Two" and "Park Place One."<br>
<br>
Plaza Seven, apparently, felt guilty about intruding upon Sarah's visit from her mother.<br>
<br>
"If I'd known, I wouldn't have..." There was something more there. Something unspoken.<br>
<br>
Sarah brushed the apology off. "I warned them both. They're not going to see me on my best behavior."<br>
<br>
"I know. I just..." Plaza Seven trailed off, but then started again. "Mistress Zero warned us not to say anything. She wanted to surprise you all. I wanted to surprise you, too, I guess."<br>
<br>
"It's fine. It's fine. Really," Sarah assured her friend. "They know. My mom knows. And they promised to make themselves scarce." Turning to Catherine, Sarah asked pointedly, "Right?"<br>
<br>
Oh! So it was that kind of a friend. Erin found her image of Sarah challenged once more.<br>
<br>
"We knew about the surprise," Sophie offered. "Not who, exactly. But that some of you all were coming."<br>
<br>
"The redhead? The girl from Talent?" Plaza Eighteen asked. "Six?"<br>
<br>
Sophie nodded. "Though, she spent the afternoon chained up in the lobby for spoiling it."<br>
<br>
Plaza Seven locked eyes with Park Place Two once more. "Alright, well, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have wanted to intrude. I didn't know your mom was coming. Or your stepsister. I just volunteered a couple of us to come over here for the holiday."<br>
<br>
"Thank you," Sarah answered. "Really, thank you. I'm not sure I'd have been able to do the same."<br>
<br>
"What are we going to do, go home? How the hell was I going to sit through Christmas dinner with my father?"<br>
<br>
Sarah laughed. "What's everyone else doing?"<br>
<br>
"There's a bunch spending tomorrow out at Two's mom's house. Fourteen's playing host to some others. But there are a whole bunch who really are going home. Five. Twelve. Twenty."<br>
<br>
"That could be awkward," Sarah responded.<br>
<br>
"Hello?" Sophie butted in, and gestured to Catherine and Erin. "More awkward than this?"<br>
<br>
"Fair point," Sarah laughed, and squeezed her mother's hand.<br>
<br>
"But there are some of us for whom a trip home is a flight and back," Plaza Eighteen added. "And we don't really have the time."<br>
<br>
"And so you came here?" Sarah asked.<br>
<br>
Plaza Eighteen shrugged. "Fuck it," she said. "I'm a mailgirl. Why not celebrate like a mailgirl?"<br>
<br>
"Too many drinks and a one-night stand?" Sophie teased.<br>
<br>
"We're here two nights, right?" Plaza Eighteen replied, and gave the young Scott sister an exaggerated wink.<br>
<br>
Erin risked a look in one of the crates. To Plaza Twenty-One, who was stretching, she asked, "How long were you in there?" To Plaza Ten, who was standing beside her and rubbing a kink out of her shoulder, Erin asked, "And there were two of you in there?"<br>
<br>
"Since three," Plaza Ten answered.<br>
<br>
"We got off a little early," Plaza Seven explained. "And we've been here for about an hour."<br>
<br>
"Which reminds me..." Plaza Ten again. "...I need to use the bathroom."<br>
<br>
"Same here," Plaza Eighteen joined in. She elbowed the tall, lanky girl with the "PL 17" on her hip. "This one's been sitting on my bladder."<br>
<br>
"The locker room," Sarah told them, apologetically. "There's no one left here to play chaperone."<br>
<br>
Plaza Eighteen groaned. The mailgirls were technically allowed to use the ladies' room (or men's room) elsewhere in the building. But to do so required the permission and monitoring of a non-mailgirl. Scarce, given the holiday.<br>
<br>
"Okay, we can go," Sophie said, and began to turn towards the door.<br>
<br>
"Hold on. One, honey?" Sarah asked. It was odd to hear Sarah call her sister by her mailgirl number. "Do we have a return time?"<br>
<br>
Sophie glanced down at her smartphone, and shook her head. "Nope," she said with a knowing smile.<br>
<br>
Sarah interlocked her fingers with those of Lindsey Czarniak. "I think we're going to hang back, then. And catch up." Of her mother, Sarah asked, "Is that okay with you?"<br>
<br>
Catherine knew full-well what Sarah was asking of her. They all knew. But the older woman, to her credit, didn't let on. "That's fine."<br>
<br>
"We'll be quick," Plaza Seven promised.<br>
<br>
As the rest of the group started for the door, Plaza Ten lingered behind. "Do you mind if I stay, too?"<br>
<br>
Erin couldn't believe the grin on Sarah's face. "Of course not," she heard her stepsister say.<br>
<br>
Once on the far side of the door, Erin followed behind Sophie, Catherine, and the mailgirls from the Plaza. To Plaza Eighteen, she whispered, "Are they going to get in trouble?"<br>
<br>
Plaza Eighteen wasn't sure, however. "It's after seven. And...'it' is allowed after hours here in Jersey City. But I'm pretty sure it's frowned upon outside of the locker room."<br>
<br>
Erin already had one punishment coming her way, thanks to Sarah's recently-acquired demerits. She wasn't eager to add another, because her stepsister was getting off with a friend - no, friends - on the loading docks.<br>
<br>
And, if she were going to get punished for it, shouldn't she have at the very least have been invited to participate on the front end? Was that a pang of jealousy she felt?<br>
<br>
Her stomach turned. No, she didn't want to have sex with Sarah. Not even if there was another girl there, between them. "Damaged," was how Sixteen's girlfriend had described them all. Maybe Erin was damaged enough to have volunteered for all of this in the first place. But she wasn't so far gone that incest - even quasi-incest, with a step-sibling - was on the table.<br>
<br>
They walked back to the locker room. Catherine, whose daughter had just more-or-less announced she'd catch up after a quick lesbian three-way, didn't seem to be shaken by Sarah's casual attitude towards sex. "Eh," she offered with a shrug, when Erin caught up with her, and asked about it without coming right out and asking about it. "This is what it is. You and I? We're not here to judge. We're not in position to judge."<br>
<br>
The irony, though, was that while they'd let Sarah, Plaza Seven, and Plaza Ten hang behind for a bit of privacy, the locker room they returned to was like something straight out of Internet pornography. Erin heard the moans before she stepped back into the room - not even the laughter and rowdy conversations could drown them out. And the sights. Again, Erin had prepared herself for this trip, but she was nowhere near prepared enough.<br>
<br>
Of the twenty-some naked girls in the locker room, not everyone was engaged in some sort of sexual gratification. Nine and Nineteen, for example, had apparently gotten the worst excesses of it out of their system, and were simply chatting with a couple of the other girls. Seven, Three, Visitor C, and Fifteen were all now in the showers, and only Three was paying her sex any mind. Mailgirl Eleven was seated, cross-legged on the floor, with Visitors H and I there with her; the little group of friends was catching up.<br>
<br>
But Mailgirl Five was masturbating by the door. Mailgirl Eight was doing the same, a few feet away. Mailgirl Sixteen had her face buried deep in Visitor A's pussy at the sinks. And Mailgirls Four and Thirteen were similarly intertwined against the back wall.<br>
<br>
Erin had told herself she'd be good. But, in that moment, she doubted she'd stay true. She worried that, by not participating, she'd end up ostracizing herself. She was naked and aroused in the middle of a lesbian swingers party. The peer pressure would get to her, if the pull of her own pussy didn't.<br>
<br>
Dinner, such as it was, soon helped quell any appetite - in her stomach and between her legs, both. There was nothing sexy about eating what amounted to dog food out of a communal trough. The ferocity of the mailgirl chow's smell was matched only by the mailgirl chow's taste, and Erin fought the urge to vomit between every bite. As she'd lost herself to the fantasy that Fall, Erin had almost ordered herself a can of the nutrient-rich paste online - just out of curiosity. She'd thought better of it then, and she certainly wasn't going to be ordering any anytime soon upon her return to LA. That she'd be expected to choke this same meal down four more times before he release on the 26th wasn't something she was looking forward to.<br>
<br>
The use of her hands wasn't allowed, of course, and so Erin had had to drop to all fours and bury her face in the trough to have her dinner. The trough was to be licked clean, but the actual mailgirls gracefully took on that particular responsibility for the visitors. So, too, did Sophie take ownership over cleaning the excess bits of food from Erin's face; Erin was licked clean like a lion cub.<br>
<br>
At some point, Sarah and the two remaining USF Plaza mailgirls arrived in the locker room. If Mistress Rei knew what they'd been up to, or why they'd been late back from the loading docks, she didn't call them on it. Erin, then, was spared any punishment for that particular sin. As it turned out, she was spared the riding crop, too, when it ultimately emerged.<br>
<br>
Catherine was not so lucky.<br>
<br>
Catherine and Erin were here to visit Mailgirls One and Two, and were synched to the profiles of the Scott sisters on the mailgirls app. By luck of the draw, Visitor D had been assigned to Mailgirl Number One, while Visitor E had been synched to Mailgirl Number Two. Sophie had picked up just as many demerits for being late to the loading dock as her sister had, but Sophie's tally at that point was still on the right side of twenty-five; both Sophie and Erin, therefore, were in the clear.<br>
<br>
Sarah, on the other hand, was over the limit. And, in addition to Sarah's mother joining in her in a round of corporal punishment, the five Plaza mailgirls had all been registered to Mailgirl Number Two. Because Sarah had missed her deadline, and because Sarah's count had gotten too high, a sum total of six girls and one grown-ass woman were bent over the sink and taken to task by Mistress Rei. And, if Mistress Rei had grown tired from the attention she'd given Mailgirls Eleven and Fourteen, or Visitors H, I, and F, she didn't show it. Erin winced each time the crop landed. The uncontrollable yips escaping from her stepmother's mouth hadn't helped, either.<br>
<br>
Erin had tried to take her place. She didn't particularly want to be spanked; that wasn't a big feature in her specific mailgirl fantasy. But Catherine had hissed at her for even suggesting it. Mistress Rei had volunteered to spank them both. In the end, Catherine had taken the licks while Sophie squeezed Erin's hand and reassured her that Mistress Rei knew what she was doing; it wasn't nearly as bad as it sounded, her stepsister told her. From experience.<br>
<br>
The yelps and the sore behinds couldn't dampen the mood, however. Family was here. Friends from home. Representatives from the sisterhood across the Hudson. When the Japanese woman finally departed, the room got positively raucous. To be fair, it had been pretty boisterous and full of life even when she'd been there in the locker room among them. The girls respected Mistress Rei, and respected the power she had over them. But they weren't quite afraid of her - that much was clear.<br>
<br>
"She wants to be one of us," Sarah explained at the sink, a short while later. "She'd rather be on this end than on that one."<br>
<br>
Angela and Catherine were comparing their battle scars by the door, and the Plaza girls were intermingling with their Park Place counterparts. Sarah, Sophie, and Erin were at the counter to one side of the showers; all three had just taken a quick rinse, and were now doing their hair and putting on make-up. There was communal lipstick, communal rouge, and communal eye shadow, just as there was communal underarm deodorant and communal toothbrushes in the drawers beneath the sinks. The communal perfume was floral and sickly sweet. The smell of the communal nail polish and communal lacquer hung in the air. None of the scents were strong enough to entirely mask the ever-present smell of pussy, however - the smell of sex, the smell of lust, the smell of womanhood.<br>
<br>
They were dolling themselves up for one another - no one else. Sarah had referred to these nights out on the town with the Plaza girls as "Bitch Sessions," nights of hard drinking and experimentation at the Imperial Hotel downtown. Human Capital had allowed the girls at Park Place to replicate that opportunity to blow off steam by granting them one night a week of relative freedom in an employee lounge up on the 2nd Floor, in the Human Resources department. They'd remain "in uniform," of course. But otherwise, the night was theirs. They were now being granted an extra such night, in celebration of the holiday. And for most of them, tomorrow would be their first day "off duty" in weeks or months.<br>
<br>
Erin was still shivering from the shower as she brushed her hair. If the dog food she'd choked down for dinner hadn't tamped down her libido, the frigid temperature of the shower certainly would have. The rough-and-scratchy hand towels provided to dry her body off hadn't helped her get warm. Hopefully, the forthcoming free-flowing alcohol up on the 2nd Floor would.<br>
<br>
Sarah seemed more relaxed and at-ease with Erin and Catherine than she had before the trip to the loading docks. Post-coital bliss could do that to a girl, Erin supposed. But even before she'd gotten laid, courtesy of some combination of the two Plaza mailgirls, Sarah had seemed like a different person than the tightly-wound academic Erin had always known. Erin chuckled to herself. Maybe there was something to be said for "spanking therapy," after all?<br>
<br>
"What was it like at the Plaza?" Erin asked. "With your last 'mistress'?" The word was still awkward to say.<br>
<br>
"Different," Sarah answered. She reflexively reached for and massaged her sore behind. "Mistress Rei can be just as intense. Maybe rougher, even. And definitely more free with her hands. But Mistress Zero was...I don't know...how do it put this? Mistress Zero was more 'Management' than Mistress Rei."<br>
<br>
"What does that mean?"<br>
<br>
"She's in on the show," Sophie butted in. Sophie had been under the Plaza's mistress's thumb for less than a day, as Erin understood it. But she spoke with authority, all the same.<br>
<br>
"She's in on the show," Sarah agreed. "She's one of us."<br>
<br>
"...and what does that mean?"<br>
<br>
"You wouldn't understand it," Sarah replied. She then shook her head. "That's unfair. Maybe you would. I mean, you're here with us. For what I assume are a lot of the same reasons. There's a pull and an appeal to this that a lot of outsiders, non-mailgirls, just don't get. The Whitestockings. How do you derive pleasure from pain? How does getting humiliated and embarrassed turn into a turn-on?<br>
<br>
"Every girl in here - excluding Sophie, and maybe Fourteen - will tell you about being blackmailed and threatened and coerced into this life. Getting tricked and duped, and having your contract re-written without your consent. But the door's always there. We're volunteers. We can walk away at any time. We're here because we want to be. Because we're getting something out of it. Because, paradoxically, it feels good, and free, and honest."<br>
<br>
"We're damaged in a very specific way," Erin opined, parroting Visitor A's viewpoint.<br>
<br>
She was met with a frown from her stepsister. "That's not it. It's not that. Really. I think we all have that fear, and go through that phase, and that line of thinking. But you come out on the other side - at least most girls do, most of the time. Being a mailgirl, having this experience, living this life - it's deeper than that. I totally get why girls re-up at the end of their contracts - there's nothing like the clarity and the control, of letting the rest of the world fuck off and fade away, and finding the focus of what you're doing."<br>
<br>
"It sounds zen."<br>
<br>
Sarah laughed. "But with more orgasms." She puckered her lips, and applied a cartoonish shade of red lipstick. "So it's probably just my pussy talking. I'm constantly drowning my brain in post-orgasmic dopamine hits."<br>
<br>
"Mind control," Sophie giggled. "Every time you cum, you're in that much deeper."<br>
<br>
Sarah shrugged. "Really and truly. Maybe that's the best way to understand why so many mailgirls stay and suffer the abuse. Addiction. We get addicted to it."<br>
<br>
Erin bit her lip, and met her stepsister's eyes in the mirror. "...which is a bad thing. Addiction is a bad thing."<br>
<br>
Sarah just smiled, and shook her head. "Okay, so maybe it's a bad metaphor. But after that first time you undress, you kind of crave that thrill and excitement and exposure of it again. And then that first time you actually act on it in public, not giving a shit about who's watching you masturbate? You crave that again, too."<br>
<br>
"But at that point, you're already in deep," Sophie added. "You already did it once. So, you do it again. And again. It gets easier. But, then, you're craving something else, some new level of pushing yourself and feeling that same initial excitement and embarrassment and turn-on and depravity, just all mixed up and complicated to shit."<br>
<br>
"Still sounds like addiction," Erin observed.<br>
<br>
Sighing, Sarah conceded, "Okay, so maybe it's a good metaphor, after all." She looked to Sophie, and then back to Erin. "It's self-centered and self-serving, and self-defeating too. And there are plenty of girls who are just absolutely miserable from the moment they sign their contracts and they never get free of it. They keep looking for outs. They keep pitying themselves. They keep hating the company for doing this to them, and keep hating the world for letting it happen. But, most? And, moreso here in Jersey than back at the Plaza? They break free of it. They accept. They submit. And once you can do that, once you can allow yourself to accept that where you are and what you're doing is on you? I don't know. It's freeing."<br>
<br>
Erin shot her stepsister a skeptical look.<br>
<br>
"I'm failing," Sarah said, helplessly, to Sophie.<br>
<br>
Before Sophie could jump in once more, however, Erin came to their rescue. "I sound judgy. And I'm not. Really, I'm not. It's more...I'm just trying to understand how any of this could be real. How any of this could happen in the real world. I'm trying to understand it, for myself, and why I feel this pull, this need, to be here with you. And trying to figure out just how fucked up I am that I do."<br>
<br>
Sarah met her stepsister's eyes once more, and assured her, "You're not fucked up. There's something deeper at work here. Bondage and discipline. Sadomasochism. Christian Grey and rape fantasies and submission and domination and exhibitionism. There's an undercurrent of it everywhere. I bet if you lined up a hundred of the most successful women out there - CEO's and doctors and professors and lawyers and whatnot - I bet more than half of them, maybe even most of them, would confess that, in their heart of hearts, buried somewhere deep down, that they felt some psychosexual urge to be dominated by a partner.<br>
<br>
"Maybe men are the same. Maybe they'd confess to the same thing. I'm not sure. I don't think it's the same. I don't know. I'm not a psychologist. I'm barely even an anthropologist anymore. But, for the first time in, like, forever, there's a real-world outlet for all of this dark and hidden and denied shit that's been lurking just below the surface. For women, at least. I think that's why the mailgirl thing caught on the way that it did. It's why it exploded everywhere, and exploded overnight."<br>
<br>
"So what's the flipside of it?" Erin asked. "If that's the pull to be mailgirl, and that's the reason girls keep signing up or keep from leaving, what's the other side of it? Why is it that these companies, and the people who work at these companies, buy in so hard on other end? That they join in, and treat these girls - who up until two minutes ago had been coworkers and colleagues and friends - like sluts and whores and something less than human?"<br>
<br>
Sarah shook her head, and Sophie answered. "Maybe people are just shitholes? And they need an outlet for it. And it's just that it's only now that they've got that outlet - in us."<br>
<br>
All three girls fell quiet for a moment, the topic getting a little too deep and little too intense and philosophical for Christmas Eve. Sarah continued with her make-up. Sophie brushed her hair. Erin looked absently at the counter. Behind them, the roar and revelry of the mailgirls locker room carried on, indifferent to the introspection and interrogation at the sink.<br>
<br>
"Mistress Rei," Sarah said finally, returning to the original topic, "was a mailgirl back in Japan. And, from what I understand from our little redheaded gossip girl, went kicking and screaming into the role of a mistress. Some sort of contract between USF and her old company. And so she's here, she's our mistress, and she's in charge of keeping us in line. But, for whatever the pull is for mailgirls here, there, or anywhere, it's clear that she still feels it."<br>
<br>
"I guarantee," Sophie added, "she'll be in some sort of get-up tomorrow. Some sort of lace-and-leather, dominatrix-type number that'll be insane. She pulls that sort of shit every once in a while, on a Sunday or on a Saturday night. Back on Thanksgiving, even."<br>
<br>
"She gets what we're feeling and what we're going through," Sarah went on. "Because she's gone through it, too. Mistress Zero was also a former mailgirl, but it was different somehow. Maybe she was just on a tighter leash, given that the Human Capital people were there in the building, and she herself was performing for them, specifically. With Mistress Rei, it's more like she's helping us perform for the audience. And it's maybe a little bit less about Will Barrow and Human Capital, and a little bit more about the girls themselves."<br>
<br>
Erin frowned. She felt unsatisfied with the Scott girls' explanations. But maybe it was unfair of her to expect them to have all the answers, to truly get at that magic elixir of psychology and neuroscience that had led her to this place on Christmas Eve, naked and collared, and a continent away from husband who loved her and who was understanding enough to let her come here and try to find these answers on her own. She was here. She was sexually aroused by her own exhibition and humiliation. Maybe there didn't need to be anything deeper than that. Whether she was broken or damaged, or whether she was just engaging in some mostly harmless self-discovery and self-exploration, it didn't change how charged up she felt, how aroused she was, or how wet her pussy was.<br>
<br>
She knew, before the night was through, she'd be breaking her promise to "be good."

<br>
<div class="column2">
<p>
It was only just after midnight that Erin Ryan O'Neill found herself on the floor of an empty cubicle, on her back and grinding her clit in complete and total surrender. The roar of the party down the hall carried on in the distance. So, too, did the vocalizations of Sophie Scott from the next cubicle over. As well as the vocalizations from another, unknown girl in another cubicle somewhere else out there in the darkness.<br>
<br>
It was dark. Erin had that going for her, at least. If she had succumbed to her baser instincts back in the locker room, it would have been under bright, fluorescent lights, with dozens of other girls playing witness to her capitulation. The same could have been said of the employee lounge here in Human Resources, though that hadn't stopped Visitor H from doing so while Mailgirl Number Eleven and her other friend, Visitor I, laughed and cheered her on. Visitor D wasn't yet so bold or abandoned.<br>
<br>
But that wasn't to say that the dimly-lit cubicle farm a hundred feet down the hall was private, exactly. For one thing, Erin wasn't going to be able to explain away her prolonged absence as a simple bathroom break - especially if she returned to the party covered in a sheen of sweat and stinking of sex. For another, Sophie Scott was in on what she was doing. In fact, it was her stepsister who had recognized the look in Erin's eye, and who had suggested she might be able to find somewhere marginally more private for her to - in Sophie's words - provide herself with a little "relief."<br>
<br>
Erin was on her back, with her knees up and her legs spread, halfway under some stranger's desk. The faint, orange glow of the power strip beside her illuminated the underside of the desk, and Erin focused, absently, on a dry and aging wad of gum directly above her. Her hair was in a puddle around her, intertwined with power cords, and when she wiggled and wriggled just so, the top of her head bumped gently against the fabric of cubicle's wall. The carpet beneath her was both scratchy and thin, the floor hard. She wanted to give in and surrender completely, to close her eyes and imagine that she was back in LA, in her bed, but she wasn't quite there. For one, she kept glancing nervously in the direction of the cubicle's opening, fearful of being discovered in such a compromised state. But also, it was her environment, and the utter depravity of fucking herself in such in an environment, that made her hotter and hornier than any session of self-pleasure had ever delivered her at home.<br>
<br>
She'd been drinking, of course. Drinking, in fact, more than could remember drinking in the last couple of years. Save for maybe her sorority sister Ashley's wedding in Glendale the prior summer? Or maybe Ashley's bachelorette party in Scottsdale a few weeks before that? Either way, Erin had had more than her fair share holiday-themed candy cane cocktails that night - equal parts vanilla rum, white chocolate liqueur, and peppermint schnapps. And while she wasn't yet drunk, she was on her way, and the fact that she'd lost count of how many times she'd re-upped could well have explained why her inhibitions had been lowered enough to take Sophie up on her offer.<br>
<br>
She wasn't exactly sure what she'd been expecting of that night's holiday party, exactly. Sarah's depictions of the "Bitch Sessions" that the Plaza girls engaged in on Friday nights had always carried with them an air of "classiness" - cocktail dresses, fancy hotel bar, Wall Street types. She understood that things could get rowdy and randy pretty quickly, but her imaginings of Mailgirl Thirteen and her friends out for an evening drink stood in stark contrast with what she assumed those same "Bitch Sessions" might be like for the 24/7 girls in Jersey City. Still naked and collared, beaten down and imprisoned, she'd half-expected the "party" here at Park Place to be nothing more than a bunch of miserable cunts slugging back vodka from water cooler cups and whining to one another under harsh lighting in a break room that smelled faintly of burnt microwave popcorn.<br>
<br>
And maybe that's what these "Bitch Sessions" were to the Park Place girls more regularly. But the 2nd Floor employee lounge was nicer than Erin had imagined it was going to be - not as nice as the executive lounge that they'd been allowed to use every once in a blue moon, Sophie apologized - but better than the rundown break room of Erin's expectations. Half the room was carpeted, the other half tiled, with a breakfast-bar-of-sorts (turned actual bar, tonight) breaking up the two zones. To one end of the room, there was a "living room" setting, complete with a flat-screen television, a pair of expensive-looking sofas, and handful of matching, upholstered chairs. Modern-looking tables and chairs were scattered about, and a Christmas tree had been erected in one corner. A big, industrial sterling silver refrigerator presided over the kitchenette area, and the coffee makers, water filtration systems, microwaves, and toasters were all top-of-the-line. It was still very much an office setting, but a high-end one. And, if a girl were to squint, she might have been able to imagine herself in an expensive downtown loft, instead of on the second floor of USF's back office in Jersey City.<br>
<br>
The girls weren't allowed to sit on the furniture, of course, so the presence of the comfortable sofas and chairs were their own torment. The veteran mailgirls seemed to pay them no mind, pushing them up against the wall and arranging a few dozen of the USF-branded pink "mailgirl mats" (no thicker and not much more different than a standard yoga mat) around in a circle in their place. But though none of the girls was bold enough to risk being caught sitting in a chair, more than a few took up spots sitting on the bar with their legs dangling beneath them, or perching up atop one of the various tables. Erin couldn't imagine that the more regular users of this room would have been crazy about exposed pussy and bare asses on top of their eating surfaces, but there seemed to be enough grey area in the policy that the Park Place girls didn't think twice about it.<br>
<br>
Holiday music blared in the background, and a Yule-tide log flickered on the flat-screen in a loop. Mailgirls Six and Eleven, as well as Visitors H and I, were tending bar and mixing cocktails when Erin, Catherine, and the Scott girls first arrived. But it was casual, and mostly self-service. Sarah and Sophie explained that Mistress Rei and her masters in Human Capital usually provided them with a good assortment of drinks, mixers, wines, and beers, but admitted that tonight's selection was on another level. In fact, they all seemed surprised by the platters of hors d'oeuvres, cookies, and desserts that had been laid out for them - for most of the Park Place girls, it was one of just a few times they'd been allowed to eat something other than mailgirl chow since they'd first inked their contracts.<br>
<br>
Girls milled about, talking and laughing with another, and making introductions to visitors from the Plaza and from the outside world. But for the lack of clothes, and maybe the aggressive drinking, this could have been a holiday party or networking event anywhere in the world. Only when she slipped up and introduced herself as "Erin," and was rewarded with a slap across the face from Sophie - a hard one, at that - did the world the mailgirls now lived in intrude upon the mirth. As Visitor A had promised, any awkwardness or embarrassment about Erin's nudity faded away quickly, and she soon found herself almost forgetting about it entirely.<br>
<br>
Almost. The mailgirls of Park Place and the Plaza were all decidedly more comfortable in their skins than Erin or the other visitors, and thought little of a hug, a caress, or holding hands. At one point, Erin had Mailgirl Number Six's hand upon her naked hip as the two chatted Catherine, Mailgirl Number Fourteen, and Mailgirl Number Fourteen's mother Angela. There was little to read into it, Erin told herself - all over the room, there was skin-to-skin contact and a casual attitude towards "handsy-ness" without there being something necessarily sexual or predatory about it. A nipple pinch here or there. A slap on the ass. A kiss on the cheek or the neck. It was all innocent enough in the early hours of the evening.<br>
<br>
Allowances had been made that let the girls use one of the nearby restrooms on the 2nd Floor without a non-mailgirl chaperone - common enough for their weekly "Bitch Sessions," as Erin understood it. Only the men's room, of course, and stall doors were still required to be left open, but the girls could come and go as they pleased. For the visitors - the Plaza girls included - this allowance was moot; said restroom was on the far side of a locked door, and required a smartphone-equipped mailgirl to lead the way. But the back-and-forth inevitably led to the party spilling out of the employee lounge and into the hallway beyond. And though none of the girls would have dared to violate Mistress Rei's restrictions of letting themselves into anyone's office, the darkened cubicle farm beyond seemed to be fair game.<br>
<br>
Conversations were wide-ranging, but often led back to life as a mailgirl, as girls swapped war stories and horror stories, and did their best to one-up each other with confessions and admissions of an increasingly naughty nature. The mailgirls told stories that left Erin's mouth agape, but also just gave the brunette a fuller picture of even the less sexual aspects of their servitude here at Park Place.<br>
<br>
"Exercise ball," Sarah answered at one point, laughing, in response to a question from her mother. She was the rare mailgirl who was actually allowed some "down time" on Sundays to work on her research - a special dispensation awarded to her due to the nature of USF's arrangement with her graduate program back in New Haven. Sarah was given the opportunity to work in one of the cubicles here in Human Resources, detailing and documenting her life among the mailgirls for her former academic advisor and head of Human Capital both. As she was restricted from sitting in a honest-to-goodness chair, however, Human Capital had opted to provide her with a giant, inflatable exercise ball for those hours in front of a keyboard.<br>
<br>
"Most of us aren't even allowed to read," Mailgirl Six added, in a lighter tone that sounded as if she found humor in the restriction.<br>
<br>
"Seriously?!!" Plaza Eighteen shrieked, aghast. She, apparently, didn't get the joke. "That's some straight-up 'Handmaiden's Tale' style bullshit!"<br>
<br>
"We're allowed to read," Sophie said, partly contradicting Six and partly coming to her defense. "We just don't have much of an opportunity. And when we do..."<br>
<br>
"Porn," Six explained. She directed Erin's attention to the magazine rack. "It was Three's turn this week to replace the usual reading materials in here with Mistress Rei's selections." Gone were the Wall Street Journals and New York Times and Fortunes that Erin assumed usually occupied the rack. Only now did Erin see that, in their stead, were issues of Playboy and Hustler, as well as such lesser-known titles as "Bait" and "Booty" and "Big & Bouncy."<br>
<br>
Sophie elaborated. "We're on the clock for twelve hours a day, every day. And usually in the locker room for the other twelve. We don't really have a chance to read, other than Saturday nights."<br>
<br>
"And when you do...?" Plaza Eighteen asked.<br>
<br>
Six shrugged. "'Reading for pleasure' has taken on different connotations." This elicited an uncomfortable laugh from Plaza Eighteen.<br>
<br>
"I read them for the articles," Sophie added sarcastically.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, Plaza Eighteen's Park Place counterpart was sitting Indian-style on one of the mailgirl mats by the magazine rack, deeply engaged in her reading material. Though a party may have been going on around her, she was using this time off the clock to catch up on all the literary offerings Mistress Rei's smut had to offer.<br>
<br>
"This can't be a Barrow thing," Plaza Eighteen remarked, referring to the director of USF's Human Capital group in a tone that almost bordered upon disappointment. The brunette apparently thought highly enough of her captor that she felt this sort of thing was beneath him.<br>
<br>
"Not his style," Six agreed. "It'd be crueler to give us Newsweeks and Cosmos and whatever. Normal stuff. To rub our noses in what we're missing, the normal stuff, from outside."<br>
<br>
"That's Barrow," Sarah offered. Chin nodding towards Park Place Eighteen and the magazine rack, "That? That's one the underlings. Bagby, maybe."<br>
<br>
While Erin had been exposed to her fair share of masturbation and muff-diving back in the mailgirls locker room, the girls' Christmas party started out on a decidedly less desperate and depraved note. She supposed this made sense; for the girls who absolutely needed some sort of physical relief, most of them had taken care of it after their shifts had ended. Dirty jokes, dirty stories, dirty looks? Sure. But - at least initially - Erin was granted a temporary reprieve from having to play audience to any sort of dirty acts. As the hours passed and the liquor flowed, however, this changed. The mood of the room began to shift, and took on an increasingly charged air. Around the same time that body shots started, Erin began to notice girls slinking off out of the party in two's and three's, or taking suspiciously long "bathroom breaks." It was only a matter of time before Mailgirl Number Ten began to openly rub one out in the corner of the room, with complete and total disregard for whoever might be watching.<br>
<br>
While Erin couldn't help but be distracted by the softly mewing girl a few feet away, the other mailgirls paid her no mind. Even back in the locker room, Erin had noticed this behavior; while a mailgirl wouldn't think twice about carrying on a conversation while at the food trough, or while squatting over the washikis, they seemed to grant one another some illusion of "privacy" when engaged with themselves, or when engaged with a partner. Immediately after completion, though, these post-orgasmic girls were often greeted with teasing, laughter, cheering, and applause.<br>
<br>
There were exceptions, however. A handful of the girls' drinking games had taken a decidedly more hardcore turn. Erin blushed all over when she realized that Plaza Seventeen and Park Place Fifteen were engaged in a "race" to see who could get herself off first, while Plaza Seven, Plaza Ten, and Sarah Scott cheered them both on, laughing and screeching all the while. Visitor H, meanwhile, had slunk off towards the back of kitchen - but that hadn't stopped her friends from hooting and hollering in her direction.<br>
<br>
It was around this point that Sophie took Erin by the hand, and led her from the room. She knew what Erin needed, even if Erin hadn't yet been able to admit it even to herself.<br>
<br>
And so it was here that Erin found herself, on the floor of a cubicle in a mostly-empty office building, with her hand between her legs. There hadn't been much back-and-forth between Erin and Sophie. For the briefest of moments, Erin feared that her stepsister might have something more participatory in mind. She was worried about how to politely decline such an offer without hurting Sophie's feelings or coming off as judgmental over how far Sophie had fallen. She was worried that, in the moment, she might not have been strong enough to do so.<br>
<br>
But, though Sophie was only a few feet away, separated from her stepsister by a thin partition, the topic of active participation in Erin's "relief" had not been broached.<br>
<br>
Erin tried her best to think of Ben. She really did. She knew that what she was doing wasn't cheating on him, exactly. But she had promised him that she'd try to be good, and this self-indulgence - solo, or borderline solo as it may have been - felt like a violation of that promise. If she fantasized about him while doing this, then...maybe...maybe...it wouldn't be so wrong. But the fact that was wrong was precisely the reason it felt so right. And, try as she might to imagine him here with her now, Ben was not a part of this fantasy come alive.<br>
<br>
Instead, as her fingers increased their speed and intensity against her clit, she found herself wondering whose cubicle this was. Because this was Human Resources, after all, the likelihood was that the cubicle's more regular occupant was a woman. On the one hand, that seemed like the preferred choice; surely another girl might forgive a sister in need? On the other, the chance that she was at a man's desk was naughtier, dirtier, and more of a turn-on. She imagined that she was here mid-day, while some middle-aged pencil pusher tried to get his work done, all while a naked mailgirl diddled herself at his feet. The sheer depravity of her need brought her to another level.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh," she moaned softly, self-conscious that Sophie would hear her.<br>
<br>
A rapid inhale-exhale, inhale-exhale, inhale-exhale was the only response from the cubicle next door.<br>
<br>
It wasn't going to take long. Erin knew her body well enough to know that, at least. As unsexy as she felt while gobbling down mailgirl chow from the communal trough in the locker room, and as brisk and frigid as her shower had been, Erin's arousal had never really abated since she'd first set foot in USF's lobby. The truth of the matter was that this had been building since she'd landed at Newark yesterday, maybe even since she'd first decided upon this visit back around Thanksgiving. For months, Erin had dreamed and fantasized and imagined what it would be like to be a mailgirl - a naked slut at the receiving end of humiliation and control on the part of some unseen corporate master. The abandonment and obscenity of it all was too much. She never stood a chance when it came to resisting these sorts of baser urges.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh..." she moaned again - a little louder this time, a little more confident. "Oh, oh, oh..."<br>
<br>
While her right hand continued on with the task at hand, her left found one of her nipples. It was rock-hard, almost painfully so, and she pinched it between her thumb and the knuckle of her index finger. She then traced it with her thumbnail, running laps around it while gently kneading the underside of her breast with her other fingers. Mistress Rei had provided similar attention earlier that afternoon - playing with her nipple absentmindedly and casually, squeezing her tit while standing behind her, breathing her hot breath on Erin's naked back. Erin had fantasized about being with a woman every now and then, of course, but she'd never acted upon it - not even in her wildest days in Tempe. Mistress Rei, with her cruel and torturous pinches, pokes, and prods was the closest she'd ever come.<br>
<br>
Erin probed the inside of her pussy with her middle finger first, and then her middle and ring almost immediately after. Her clit was rewarded with an upgrade, as the butt of her palm picked up where her fingers had left off. She ground forcefully up against her hand, her hips rising to meet it and her bare behind lifting ever-so-slightly up off the floor.<br>
<br>
"Hooo..." she breathed.<br>
<br>
She was wet. Wetter than she had probably ever been, her whole life over. Whatever conflicts were playing out in her psyche between her id and ego, these were conflicts that her body did not share in. Her pussy knew what it wanted. Her pussy knew what it needed. Her pussy was in the driver's seat now. It was calling the shots. Perhaps it had been calling the shots all along.<br>
<br>
The build was less of a build, and more of a sudden and uncontrollable surprise. And it came not from the presence of Erin's hand alone - but, rather, from the presence of two naked figures in the dimly lit space above her, standing the entrance of her cubicle.<br>
<br>
"Sorry!" one the girls yipped. They both giggled and then stepped back into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Erin exploded. "Gaaaah!" she yelped, surprised by her climax and by being caught in the act all at the same time. "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhh!" Any pretense of biting of her tongue was now gone.<br>
<br>
Her hips bucked violently and she arched her back. Her left hand now joined her right on top of her pussy, as if she was trying to hold onto the orgasm as long as she could, as if she could keep it from escaping. Her leg muscles tightened, her heels lifted off the ground, and she rose to the balls of her feet.<br>
<br>
And, through it all, she heard Sophie giggle in a hoarse, out-of-breath voice, "...this one's occupied, too!" Apparently, Erin's visitors had simply tried to move on to the next cubicle over.<br>
<br>
One orgasm would never be enough for Erin. It had never been, when she was alone. More recently, it was at least three before she was ready to be done. Certainly, here and now, one wasn't going to cut it. Before the entirety of her first had even passed, her right hand was back at work, coaxing out a second.<br>
<br>
She was embarrassed, of course, at being caught in such a compromised state. By that point, however, she'd lost count of the number of girls she'd witnessed getting themselves off since the mailgirls had returned to the locker room. She told herself that she was just one more girl among many. She wasn't sure if that was her brain rationalizing it or reasoning with her sense of shame, or if it was her crotch - willing to make her believe anything in that moment, so long as she didn't stop. Being caught, even as briefly as she had been, and even if her witnesses hadn't seen her face, was humiliating. But humiliating in an oh-so-delicious way.<br>
<br>
In that moment, as orgasm number two now began to announce it was coming, Erin felt a few brief seconds of clarity. If it weren't for her tattoo, none of the girls back at party would ever have been able to single her out, or identify that it was Erin O'Neill - sorry, Visitor D - writhing on the floor of that cubicle. But, whoever they had been - Park Place mailgirls, Plaza mailgirls, other visitors, or even Sarah and Catherine - they'd know full-well who she was and what she'd done to herself when she returned to the employee lounge. They'd seen her transformed, and they'd witnessed her become sex incarnate, arousal realized. They'd seen her at her most vulnerable and most honest, singly focused on nothing more than sexual pleasure.<br>
<br>
She climaxed again.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As her obsession with all things mailgirl began to take hold over her that Fall, Erin increasingly took a more circuitous route back from work. Capstone Partners was downtown, as was Donovan Runnels. Capitol Pictures had a program, but was all the way over in Hollywood. Okajima Heavy Industries was down in Long Beach. Fabrikam, though? Fabrikam wasn't unreasonably out-of-the-way, and Erin could take the long way home, pass by their suburban headquarters, and still get in the door before Ben.<br>
<br>
Erin knew it was unlikely she'd get a peek at one of Fabrikam's mailgirls, especially at that time of day. The company's offices weren't terribly exciting from the outside - just the usual bland, modernist glass and concrete structure, with its neatly trimmed grass and manicured hedges that could be found anywhere in the sprawl of Greater Los Angeles. She knew, from her research on the Post Office, that the Fabrikam girls were all picked up at home by a company shuttle bus with tinted windows. That they wore formless white shifts that they were expected to surrender to the driver the moment they boarded. And that they were unloaded each morning inside the building's parking structure. The chance that Erin would catch a glimpse of one of these naked slaves was slim to none. The only outward sign that Fabrikam even had a mailgirl program was the presence of a Whitestocking encampment across the street, protesting its existence.<br>
<br>
And yet passing by the building became a part of Erin's daily routine all the same. There was something exciting about being so close to the action, about just being in the vicinity of the mailgirl world, that kept her from her more normal commute. Back in October, and in early November, that had seemed almost enough.<br>
<br>
She imagined herself as one of them. Rising each morning before dawn, with Ben still asnooze in bed, and stripping out of her nightie. Slipping on her shift, with nothing beneath it, and waiting at the end of her driveway for the short bus to come. Stripping again once aboard, with her covering - such as it was - deposited into a communal box at the front of bus, and knowing full-well that the shift she wore home at the end of the day might have been on another girl entirely that morning. Getting unloaded in the garage with her fellow naked mailgirls, and being roughly hustled out to the courtyard that served as Fabrikam's take on the mailgirl locker room. Showering outdoors. Shaving her intimate areas while the muggles all watched from inside. Getting collared, getting leashed, and getting inspected before being put into circulation.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the humiliation that appealed to her; the embarrassment and dehumanization of it all was secondary, a product of what the real allure was. It was control. It was surrender. It was playing the part of sex object while someone else called the shots.<br>
<br>
How could she ever have expected Ben to understand that?<br>
<br>
She'd met Ben O'Neill shortly after college. He was tall, good-looking, and - above all else - kind. Their marriage was one of those modern, 21st century ones where they took turns making dinner, folding the laundry, shopping for groceries, and all of that. Ben brought home flowers for her every Friday afternoon, and sometimes just because. They went on hikes together, trips up the coast together, and out to dinner for "date night" every other Saturday. They communicated well, telling each other everything - every dream, every fear, every hope for their life together. Because of this, Erin had felt guilty keeping her online exploration of Mailgirls Exposed and the Post Office from him.<br>
<br>
Erin's preoccupation with idea of mailgirls was very likely a reaction to fact that she and Ben had been talking about kids more and more over the last year. She was thirty, and Ben had a couple of years on her. They both had good, stable jobs. They owned a house in the suburbs, in a neighborhood they'd chosen in large part due the quality of the school district. And Erin wanted kids. She did. She really did. She just wasn't sure she wanted them quite yet. She liked being the hot, young schoolteacher the eleventh-grade boys thought about in the privacy of their own bedrooms, the young-and-fun girl still in her twenties. She wasn't ready to become someone's mom. She wasn't ready to sacrifice her body, and be that woman with saggy tits and a muffin-top. Ben wasn't pressuring her. It wasn't his style. But Erin had felt the pressure all the same.<br>
<br>
Sophie had called a couple of times that previous summer, panicking over her own impending life events. Though never quite as buttoned-down and conservative as her older sister Sarah, Erin had always thought of Sophie as someone who knew who she was, and knew what she wanted, from an early age. Even as a teenager, Sophie seemed to be one of those people who had it all figured out - certainly more so than Erin ever did. But Sophie was increasingly on-edge about her wedding to John, fretting over whether she was too young to settle down. From high school to college, from college to dental school. From Patrick and Catherine's house to the dorms, and from the dorms directly into an apartment with her fiancée. House, job, pets, kids, graduations, retirement, death. It all seemed to be planned out too soon, too early, too neat.<br>
<br>
Erin wrote it off as nothing more than cold feet - at least initially. But it caused her to reflect on her own life, and her own life choices. If Sophie, at twenty-three, was worried that there were no more big adventures out there for her, what did that mean for Erin at thirty?<br>
<br>
John had been outraged when Sophie called off the wedding, and informed him that, instead, she'd been spending the next two years as a naked mailgirl in New Jersey. He just couldn't understand it, and was furious that Sophie would do this to him. Ben, in contrast, had been concerned and empathetic - it was his nature. He even offered to Catherine that he could look over the contracts Sarah and Sophie signed to find some sort of loophole; he wasn't a lawyer by training, but he worked in Procurement, and knew enough that he might be able to parse the legalese. Catherine had thanked him, and shared the contracts with him, but nothing had ever really come of it. After all, both Sarah and Sophie had volunteered for this, whatever their individual reasons had been.<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," Ben had told Erin that morning in bed earlier in the month month, surrendering to her need to go visit her stepsisters and everything that that visit entailed.<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," he'd repeated, when he'd dropped her off at LAX.<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," she imagined him saying, when she'd quit her job and put in application at Fabrikam.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
"Fire alarm!" Erin thought to herself, waking with a start.<br>
<br>
The world was dark around her, and the floor hard beneath her. She panicked, and grabbed at the collar on her neck, knowing it was connected to a short, metal leash, which in turn was connected to a metal eye-hook in the floor. If there were a fire, there'd be no way to get free; inebriated as she may have been the night before, she hadn't forgotten the sound of the "click" as she'd fastened the leash to her collar. It would take one of Mistress Rei's keys to get free.<br>
<br>
She could, however, remove her eye mask, and did so. She was greeted immediately by the bright, fluorescent lighting of the locker room. She squinted, and rubbed her eyes, the light assaulting her just as much as the ringing was assaulting her ears. The eye mask - a blindfold, in essence - had been a necessity. The mailgirls locker room was bathed in light twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Shut-eye required the aid of a staple from the world of bondage and discipline.<br>
<br>
Around her, thirty-some-odd naked girls were all pulling off their own masks, and rising from the floor, but only the visitors seemed shaken and confused by the clanging of the alarm bell. This was, apparently, routine.<br>
<br>
"Good morning, pets!" Mistress Rei sang out from the center of the room in heavily-accented English, her back to the squat toilets. "Merry Christmas!"<br>
<br>
True to Sophie's word, Mistress Rei had given up the pretense of being anything more than a full-fledged dominatrix. She was dressed in a black leather corset, laces cinched tight at the mid-section, with garter straps connected to a pair of white fishnet stockings with scalloped lace around each thigh. This was apparently Mistress Rei's holiday outfit, though, as the cups of the corset were a bright red, with a big, black bow between them. The edges of the corset itself - at her chest, at her waist - were trimmed with snow-white fur. She wore a pair of red panties, which Erin would later realize was a thong that left her backside nearly fully exposed. On her feet were platform heels, the same shade as her underwear and the corset's cups, with five-inch stilettos, a bit of fake mistletoe near the toes, and more of the white fur at the ankles. In her right hand was a black-and-red leather bull whip, maybe four feet in length, that ended with a small tuft of black leather tails.<br>
<br>
Erin's jaw dropped.<br>
<br>
"Up, up, up!" Mistress Rei sang out, and cracked the whip against the backside of first one, and then another, of the two girls closest to her - in this instance, Mailgirl Eleven and Mailgirl Thirteen. Visitor G (Mailgirl 12's aunt, Erin had learned last night) got the next kiss from the whip, and she yipped out in a mixture of pain and surprise. Mistress Rei wasn't swinging the instrument with any particular ferocity, but the "crack!" each time it landed sounded vicious all the same.<br>
<br>
"The rest of the visitors will be arriving at noon," Mistress Rei called out. The male visitors, she meant. "Today is a holiday. Even for little sluts like you. But before we do presents, I expect you all in uniform. Inspection is at six-thirty. Wash. Shave. Shampoo. Food. Water. And then back on your knees."<br>
<br>
She unlocked Mailgirl Thirteen, freeing her from her leash, and then handed over her keys for Thirteen to do the same for the others. With a few quick taps on her tablet, Mistress Rei brought a merciful end to the ringing of the alarm bells, and then began to pace menacingly down the line of naked girls in the direction of Erin and the Scott sisters.<br>
<br>
Erin drank in her surroundings. Park Place's mailgirls had all secured themselves to their usual spots. Sophie and Sarah, as Mailgirls One and Two, were on the end, closest to the door that Erin, Catherine, and the visitors had all first entered the previous afternoon. At the next eye-hook over were Mailgirls Three and Four, and then Mailgirls Five and Six at the next after that, and so on down the line. The visitors - the Plaza girls and the outsiders - had been given more freedom to choose where they'd bed down for the night. For the most part, they'd chosen to secure themselves with their hosts, as Erin had with her stepsisters. Visitor B was with her sister, Mailgirl Five. Visitor G was with her niece, Mailgirl Twelve. Visitor A was with her girlfriend, Mailgirl Sixteen. But, as there were only nineteen regular mailgirls distributed among twelve eye-hooks in the floor, Visitors H and I had opted for the last hook, unoccupied, on the far side of the room. Catherine and Angela - or, rather, Visitor E and Visitor F - had taken the other empty hook beside them. Plaza Ten, Plaza Seventeen, and Plaza Twenty-One were all with Park Place Nineteen, Plaza Eighteen had cuddled up with Park Place Six, and Plaza Seven had joined Erin, Sarah, and Sophie here on this side of the room.<br>
<br>
Erin had been spared the embarrassment of having to face her stepmother when she'd returned to the party with Sophie last night. As things began to get a bit more out of control, Mailgirl Fourteen had escorted her mother and Catherine Ryan back to the locker room for an earlier bedtime than the rest of the girls. Erin doubted that anything had happened between them. At least, she liked to tell herself that nothing had happened between them. But, even if they had paired off, a lesbian tryst between the two oldest visitors couldn't have held a candle to the other pairing that had the party tittering over and whispering about. No, it was what Mailgirl Five and her sister had done that had scandalized and shocked a group of girls who were most likely difficult to scandalize and shock.<br>
<br>
Erin risked a glance in their direction. If either Mailgirl Five or Visitor B felt any shame in what they had done, there didn't seem to be any evidence of it. They were standing close together, holding hands, and whispering secrets in one another's ear, giggling and smiling back and forth. In a room full of goddesses and supermodels, these two were on another level. Big round tits, the both of them, with long, blonde hair and bright smiles. These two would have been the stuff of masturbatory fantasy even fully-dressed. That they'd been caught together in the men's room, with Mailgirl Five's tongue buried deep between her sister's legs, was so twisted and warped and wanton that Erin couldn't even fathom the decision-making that had gone into such an incestful pairing. That they'd carried on even after being discovered - and even switched giver and receiver - signaled such a complete and total lack of shame that Erin couldn't wrap her head around it.<br>
<br>
Not that Erin was really in a position to judge. She'd masturbated with her own stepsister, after all, with only a few feet and a flimsy partition between them. When she'd finally finished and sat up, she'd been greeted by a big, sly smile on Sophie's face, peering over the cubicle divide. Sophie had wrapped up a few minutes before Erin had fully satisfied herself, and had played witness to at least Erin's last body-shaking, spasm-inducing orgasm on the floor.<br>
<br>
"Better?" was all Sophie had asked of her.<br>
<br>
"Much," Erin had answered, while simultaneously wondering if the dim lighting of the surge protector and the scattered exit signs gave away just how furiously she was blushing.<br>
<br>
If Sophie had felt any shame of what they'd done more-or-less together, she showed no more sign of it than the other pair of sisters a few eye-hooks down. She smiled at Erin when their eyes met, as Erin took in her fellow "hook-mates."<br>
<br>
Sarah and Plaza Seven were still making googly eyes at one another, and it was clear that - Ten's presence in their reunion yesterday evening notwithstanding - there was something more than just purely physical between them. It made sense. Erin got it. She understood it. They had a history together at USF Plaza downtown, a shared experience that made their relationship deeper than just a desperate pussy and a willing tongue. Erin had witnessed such connections last night, beyond just Sarah and Plaza Seven, beyond Mailgirl Sixteen and her girlfriend. Mailgirls Seventeen and Eighteen appeared to be very much an exclusive couple. And Mailgirl Twelve had introduced her aunt to Mailgirl Three in such a way that signaled Three was someone very important in Twelve's life. "Letter-carrying lesbians," all, who'd found love and affection amid enslavement and abuse.<br>
<br>
That said, whatever Sarah's relationship was with Plaza Seven, it wasn't a monogamous one. The race Erin had witnessed between Plaza Seventeen and Park Place Fifteen earlier in the evening, to see who could masturbate to climax first, escalated towards something else entirely towards the tail end of the night. And it was Plaza Twenty-One who had her tongue buried deep in Sarah's pussy, while Sarah sat up atop the bar. Beside her, Park Place Six was similarly engrossed in a similarly situated Plaza Eighteen. Plaza Eighteen sung out the redheaded mailgirl's victory loudly, to cheers and laughter and applause around the room, when Park Place Six got her over the crest. If Sarah was disappointed in her-and-Twenty-One's second place finish, though, she got one hell of a consolation prize all the same.<br>
<br>
It was one thing to have her stepsister excuse herself, to hang back at the loading dock to greet old friends. It was another thing entirely to watch her cum in a crowded room full of naked mailgirls, on the losing end of a cunnilingus race. Though she was currently re-assigned to a bit of forced time off here at USF, Sarah Scott was still technically a doctoral candidate at Yale.<br>
<br>
"Oh!" Sarah had called out, her eyes wide open and her chest heaving. She held tight to the back of Plaza Twenty-One's head, and refused to let go - even though the race was over. "Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"<br>
<br>
"...stare, if you want to," Sophie had told Erin earlier in the evening, in reference to Nine masturbating under the shower. "She doesn't care. Some of us like the audience." Sophie might very well have been referring to her own sister, apparently. Erin and Sarah locked eyes as Sarah peaked. Gone was Sarah Scott, the PhD-to-be. In her place was only the wild, desperate, animal lust of Mailgirl Number Two.<br>
<br>
Now, though, Sarah seemed be feeling a little more shame than Mailgirl Five and Visitor B were exhibiting. She caught Erin's eyes again this morning, and then quickly looked away. Plaza Seven squeezed her hand, kissed her lightly on the lips, and waited with her to be unlocked. Erin wondered if things would ever be the same between her and Sarah again. She didn't see how they could be. Thankfully, she was distracted by the arrival of Mistress Rei and her whip.<br>
<br>
"Crack!"<br>
<br>
With barely a flick of her wrist, Mistress Rei had snapped her bullwhip and landed it perfectly upon Erin's right buttock. Erin barked in pain, the sting more surprising than painful, and she instinctively put her hands out in front of her as if to stop another blow. She'd been spared the riding crop last night, but she wasn't so lucky that morning.<br>
<br>
"Stand and wait like a mailgirl!" Mistress Rei ordered. "Legs apart! Shoulders back! Titties out! Eyes down!"<br>
<br>
Erin was far from the only naked girl "out of position" as she waited to be unlocked. But, apparently, it was just her turn to receive attention from her new mistress. She winced as the Japanese woman cocked her wrist once more, but she did as she was told, all the same. She fought back a tear and braced for another kiss from the whip, though it didn't come. Not yet, at least.<br>
<br>
Instead, Mistress Rei reached out and grabbed her violently and viciously by her left nipple, tugging her whole torso downwards and towards her, so they were face-to-face. Even with the other woman in heels, Erin still had a few inches on her. Without releasing her grip, Mistress Rei proceeded to lick Erin's cheek from jaw to temple, and whispered in her ear, "Have you been nice? Or have you been naughty?"<br>
<br>
"Naughty," Erin whimpered softly. "Naughty, Mistress Rei."<br>
<br>
"Louder!"<br>
<br>
"Naughty."<br>
<br>
"Louder!"<br>
<br>
"Naughty, Mistress Rei! This girl has been naughty!"<br>
<br>
"I knew it," the woman hissed. "I know what you are. I could smell it on you yesterday."<br>
<br>
Erin willed Mailgirl Thirteen to hurry with the keys.<br>
<br>
"I could smell it. Smell your dirty, naughty cunt. You don't fool me. You're not a visitor. You're a mailgirl." She leaned back in to Erin's ear, so that only Erin could hear her. "Tell me what you did. Tell me how you were naughty."<br>
<br>
"I...I...I..." Erin began, and was treated to increased pressure upon her nipple between her mistress's finger and thumb.<br>
<br>
"'This girl...'" Mistress Rei corrected.<br>
<br>
"This girl..." Erin parroted back. "This girl...touched...touched herself in an empty cubicle."<br>
<br>
"'This girl fucked herself.'"<br>
<br>
"This girl fuh..fucked herself."<br>
<br>
"'This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy.'"<br>
<br>
"This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy."<br>
<br>
"'This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy the first chance she got.'"<br>
<br>
"This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy the first chance she got."<br>
<br>
"Louder."<br>
<br>
"This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy the first chance she got!"<br>
<br>
"Louder."<br>
<br>
"This naughty girl finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy the first chance she got!!" Erin yelled out. Catherine would know about it now.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei released her grip, and Erin did her best to catch her breath.<br>
<br>
"Were you alone?"<br>
<br>
"I...I...I..."<br>
<br>
"Crack!" Erin felt the sting of the bullwhip once more. It stung. It was painful. But Mistress Rei exhibited enough control that it didn't out-and-out hurt so much as Erin might have expected.<br>
<br>
"This mailgirl was with her!" Sophie called out, coming to her rescue. Erin would have lied, and said she was alone. Sophie knew the consequences for lying.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei cocked an eyebrow. She looked to Sophie, and then back to Erin. "'This naughty slut finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy with her sister.'"<br>
<br>
Step-sister, Erin corrected her mentally. The distinction, though, didn't seem to matter in the here and now.<br>
<br>
"This naughty slut finger-fucked her wet, dirty pussy with her sister!" she yipped. A tear streamed down her face.<br>
<br>
"No need to cry," Mistress Rei assured her with mock comfort. "We've got nothing but naughty sluts here. Santa still made his rounds." She laughed. "Tell me. What is it that you want from Santa? More than anything in the world?"<br>
<br>
Diamond earrings, she told herself. A pearl necklace. A new car.<br>
<br>
"This girl wants to be a mailgirl," she mewed.<br>
<br>
"That," Mistress Rei smiled appreciatively, "we can do."<br>
<br>
Panic set in. What had she just done? What had she just said? Was that how this began? She had just blurted it out. She thought that was what Mistress Rei wanted to hear. Whether it was true or not...<br>
<br>
"But not here," the woman went on, and gestured to her hip. "Tattoo. And -" she added, emphasizing, "too slutty. Too much of a slut even for us. You want this too bad. You reek of it."<br>
<br>
Too slutty for a room full of girls finger-fucking themselves and each other for the better part of the last twelve hours. Mistress Rei's dismissal stung her more than the whip.<br>
<br>
"I'll see what Santa can do," Mistress Rei said. "We have friends."<br>
<br>
Erin shuddered. She screamed inwardly at herself. She wanted to beg and plead to take it back. She wanted to pull out her hair. She wanted to run screaming from this room, and back into Ben's waiting arms.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Mistress Rei," was all she offered in response.<br>
<br>
The horror she felt was reflected in the faces of Sarah and Sophie, when Mistress Rei walked away and Erin finally dared to look up from the floor.<br>
<br>
"No!" Sarah whispered at her angrily. "You don't want this."<br>
<br>
"I...I...I..."<br>
<br>
"No," Sarah repeated forcefully. "Ben."<br>
<br>
Ben. Erin began to whimper, and she knew more tears were coming.<br>
<br>
"Mailgirls don't cry," Sophie said, and grabbed her by the hand. "Don't let them see you cry."<br>
<br>
"You don't want this," Sarah insisted. She looked away, and then back to her stepsister. "Don't do this."<br>
<br>
Erin sniffled, and held back a sob. "I just don't know..." She trailed off.<br>
<br>
"They'll fuck you. I promise. They'll fuck you," Sarah said through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
"Don't sign anything," Sophie added.<br>
<br>
"They might not need her to." This from Plaza Seven. "I'm sure there's something in the agreement she already signed."<br>
<br>
There wasn't. Erin knew the visitor's agreement forwards and backwards. She'd been through it over and over and over. Ben had even forced himself to read through it, to make sure. He had started and stopped three times, getting too angry to finish, before finally buckling down and barreling through. But...maybe...maybe she'd missed something. Maybe she hadn't understood something. Or - she gasped - maybe they'd slipped something into the agreement she'd re-signed at the security desk yesterday?<br>
<br>
"Whatever they put in front of you, don't do it," Sarah went on. "Whatever it is. Promises to pay off your mortgage. Promises of some big payday."<br>
<br>
"Threats," Sophie said.<br>
<br>
"Threats," Sarah agreed. "Whatever they say. You've got Ben. You'll be alright. You don't want this."<br>
<br>
"You don't want this," Sophie echoed.<br>
<br>
You don't want this, Erin told herself. Do you?<br>
<br>
Mailgirl Thirteen arrived at that very moment, looking as pale over the exchange as Erin was sure that she herself did. She reached out, and gently unlocked the leash from Erin's collar.<br>
<br>
"Thank you," Erin croaked.<br>
<br>
To say that the back-and-forth with Mistress Rei had been a mood dampener was an understatement. This all suddenly felt too real. Too much like a nightmare, whereas before it had been only fantasy. There was now a very real possibility that she wouldn't be flying home to LA tomorrow.<br>
<br>
But spirits seemed low, all around. Gone was the unbridled exuberance Erin had witnessed when the mailgirls got through with their shifts yesterday. Gone was the wildness and sexiness and over-the-top orgy atmosphere that had defined the mailgirls' Christmas party. All around her, the locker room was calmer and quieter than it had been before. Even the handful of girls Erin saw masturbating in the shower did so joylessly, more utilitarian and reluctant than as an outlet for pent-up sexual energy. They were all hung over, Erin supposed, and suffering from a lack of sleep; if it was five-and-change now, Erin doubted that she could have gotten more than three hours of sleep last night.<br>
<br>
Erin's head was spinning, but she knew it wasn't just the peppermint schnapps and cherry liqueur.<br>
<br>
Though they all were to experience the first-of-its-kind "day off" here at Park Place, the reality of the mailgirls' normal morning routine had a sobering affect upon them all.<br>
<br>
There were just six showerheads for a sum total of thirty-three naked girls, and so there was a bottleneck in the girls' efforts to be ready in time for "inspection." They improvised, though, by often doubling up and hurrying along to the best of their ability. Erin, for one, had no interest in lingering beneath the ice-cold water the girls were allowed for their morning showers, but she was forced to remain there for a good duration all the same. Though she and Catherine both, independently, had gone and gotten waxed before their trip to New Jersey, Sarah insisted that Erin still needed to "make a show" of shaving her pubic region before submitting herself to Mistress Rei.<br>
<br>
"I'll do you. You do me," Sarah suggested, almost apologetically. "It's faster."<br>
<br>
What was Erin going to say? As awkward as her stepsister's hands between her legs might have been, it was no more or less awkward than anything else Erin had submitted herself to since arriving at Park Place. And, it appeared that this was a more common practice among the Park Place mailgirls than was going it alone.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry," Sarah offered quietly under the shower. She was down on one knee in front of Erin, at crotch-height, and gently sliding a razor across the inside of Erin's thigh.<br>
<br>
"Sorry for what?" Erin asked. Had Sarah accidentally cut her with the blade?<br>
<br>
"For everything," Sarah answered. It was heartfelt. And intimate, in a way that was only somewhat diminished by the fact that there were other naked girls on either side of them. "I didn't mean to come off that way, so judgmental, just now." She swallowed. "And I'm sorry about...about...last night. I just got carried away."<br>
<br>
Oh, so they were acknowledging it now? The eye contact, that is. As Sarah had climaxed and locked eyes with her stepsister.<br>
<br>
"It's okay," Erin replied meekly. "It's okay."<br>
<br>
Sarah hesitated, and ran the razor through the shaving cream on Erin's groin once more. There wasn't any stubble to be found, but Sarah was meticulous all the same. "It's not. It's my fault - all of it. None of you would be here now, forced to do any of this, if it weren't for me. Not you. Not 'Mailgirl Number One.' Not 'Visitor E.' I feel like I infected you all with this."<br>
<br>
"You didn't force me to do any of this. In fact, you did your best to tell me to stay away. But I wouldn't listen."<br>
<br>
"But if it weren't for me..."<br>
<br>
"If it weren't for you, I might have gone barreling headfirst into all this, anyways. I mean, it's kind of a thing. Kind of an obsessed thing. Kind of an obsessed thing that I can seem to shake. I needed to do it, and see it for myself. If it weren't for the 'visitors' program here, I might have already signed a full-on contract back home. I'm not sure I would have been strong enough to resist it."<br>
<br>
"Come on..."<br>
<br>
"I'm serious. Seriously serious. You heard Mistress Rei. She can smell it on me."<br>
<br>
"A: I'm pretty sure she was fucking with you. And, B: I'm pretty sure it was your vagina she was talking about..." She paused in what she was doing, inspected her work, and then looked up at Erin. "Which..."<br>
<br>
"Shut up!" Erin laughed.<br>
<br>
"You can rinse," Sarah instructed. "I'm pretty sure were fine beforehand, but they're pretty strict about this."<br>
<br>
"Okay." Erin stepped back under the ice-cold water, and used her hands to wipe the remainder of the shaving cream away.<br>
<br>
"You don't have to do me," Sarah said to Erin, standing and asking Mailgirl Seventeen to pass her the can of shaving cream. "I've got a little more going on. And I'm a little more practiced at this."<br>
<br>
Erin didn't necessarily want to get so up close and personal with her stepsister's crotch. But they'd had a tit-for-tat deal, hadn't they. "Are you sure?"<br>
<br>
"Uh-huh. It's fine. I know what I'm doing." Sarah squeezed a liberal amount of shaving cream into her palm, and began lathering herself up on either side of her slit, and up above. She got back to her knees, and then down her backside, before spreading her legs wide open and beginning her routine. Two showerheads over, Mailgirl Eleven and Visitor I were in the same position, doing the same thing.<br>
<br>
Sarah's stubbly pussy didn't need the entirety of her attention, however. "Alright, well, I'm sorry for jumping all over you just now, then. I don't know what's going on with you. I can't see inside your head. And I'm the absolute last person to judge you if this is really and truly something you need to do. You know, long-term."<br>
<br>
"You're looking out for me."<br>
<br>
"I'm looking out for you," she agreed. "This," - meaning Erin's visit - "isn't what this is like most of the time. Last night? We get that once a week. And it gets taken away from us if the demerits start piling up, or if they just want to fuck with us. No food, either. Not real food. If we're hungry for something to eat, it's just more chow."<br>
<br>
"I kind of figured..."<br>
<br>
"It's hard. It really is. We have an EVP here, on the sixth floor, that the girls all call 'Captain Buttplug.' He's got a toy - a couple of them, in fact - that I think has made the rounds, into each and every one of us."<br>
<br>
Erin blanched. "I thought that USF didn't..."<br>
<br>
"It gets a little more gray the higher up the food chain you go."<br>
<br>
"Ugh."<br>
<br>
"Ugh," Sarah agreed. "There's also this absolute, fucking bitch in Clearing who likes to decorate us with binder clips."<br>
<br>
"Jesus."<br>
<br>
"And I think you saw what they did to Six? When you first got here?"<br>
<br>
"I did. We did."<br>
<br>
"It gets worse. I got left upside down in a St. Andrew's Cross - don't ask - and ended up passing out. Outside. In November."<br>
<br>
"Were you okay? I mean, obviously..."<br>
<br>
"Yeah. No. I mean, I was fine, in the end. But, what I'm saying is that this all can feel exciting. And exploratory. And, fuck, I mean it is. But there's this thin line between sadomasochism and just out-and-out sadism. Sociopath shit. And, honestly, I'm worried that that line keeps getting blurrier." She paused. "You don't want to do this."<br>
<br>
Erin just nodded.<br>
<br>
Sarah was almost done now. She rinsed. She inspected herself. She went back one more time for a touch-up.<br>
<br>
"Last night," she began. "With Twenty-One. And then you were there..."<br>
<br>
"It's okay."<br>
<br>
"Okay. I just, I don't know, I got caught up. And having you and my mom here? It's just, like, I don't know, like all of this on crack."<br>
<br>
"It's okay," Erin assured her. "I promised I'd give you space. It's my fault."<br>
<br>
"No, no. It's not. I can't promise you that it won't happen again. With the other Seven here, I'm not sure that I can...I'm not sure that I want to stop. You don't need to disappear, is what I'm saying. It is what it is."<br>
<br>
Sarah finished, stood, and rinsed. Erin reached for the knob, and turned the water off. Both of them wrung out their hair. As they stepped from the shower block, bodies dripping with cold water and skin covered in goose bumps, Erin asked, "Are you going to stay?" That is, would Sarah stay with USF, even after her contract was through.<br>
<br>
"So...who knows if I even have a choice in the matter," she answered glumly. "But, no, I want to go back and finish my PhD."<br>
<br>
The two girls helped themselves to the scratchy white hand towels and began to dry off. "And then?"<br>
<br>
"And then, I don't know. The paper I wrote is getting a good amount of attention. Good and bad. But I'm in this niche now, one that no one is really looking at from an academic standpoint. And certainly not from an insider's perspective. I mean, my reputation is just completely and totally trashed now. The mailgirls thing is just absolutely radioactive on college campuses, so I'm not sure I'm going to get the faculty position or the fellowship I might have wanted.<br>
<br>
"Which sucks because it's good work. And work that the field - Sociocultural Anthropology, that is - really should be doing. And maybe, in a couple of years, if and when mailgirls as a concept really and truly goes mainstream, and assuming Congress doesn't pull the plug on the whole fucking thing next month, maybe I'll get the sort of opportunity I thought I'd get - that I talked myself into thinking I'd get - before I got undressed that first time back in June.<br>
<br>
"Until then? I don't know. I've really only got my experiences here at USF to speak to. I've been thinking that maybe I need to go somewhere else. Somewhere where they do all of this a little differently, and in their own way. Maybe some place that's, I don't know, maybe even a little rougher?"<br>
<br>
This startled Erin. "'Rougher'? Like, 'providing relief' sort of rougher?"<br>
<br>
Sarah shrugged. "Maybe. In for a penny."<br>
<br>
"You'd do that?"<br>
<br>
"Like I said, my reputation is shit anyways. No one's going to think any less of me. What's the harm in getting my rocks off, and really going deep? Really going all the way? If I'm going to get called a 'slut' and a 'whore' no matter what I do, why not drop the whole 'look-but-don't-touch' shit and own it. Really and truly. And, afterwards? Let the world catch up, and accept me for who I am."<br>
<br>
"Wow," Erin said. She took the already soggy towel, and did her best to dry her hair a bit more. She hesitated, and then asked pointedly, "But not me?"<br>
<br>
Sarah met her stepsister's eyes. "You have Ben. Who loves you. I'm sure if you asked, he'd be happy to spank you and whip you and do whatever else it is you think you're missing out on. There are people who are into this sort of thing, without having to become full-on mailgirls."<br>
<br>
"Enough chit-chat," Mistress Rei bellowed in their direction. "Kiss and say 'I love you' later. Hair and make-up. Weigh-ins. And then back your spots."<br>
<br>
It was gross to share underarm deodorant. It was grosser still to share a toothbrush. But Erin still dutifully readied herself for inspection. She'd choked down a healthy serving of mailgirl chow before her shower, hoping to quell the churn of a stomach that had been treated to too much alcohol the night before. But she discovered that doing so before weighing in was a rookie mistake; the girls were all measured to within a tenth of a pound, and the difference between a full stomach and an empty one could potentially lead to demerits. As the scale synched with Erin's profile on Sophie's phone, she noted that she registered a little heavier than the night before - negligibly so, and within such a margin that she might never have noticed it at home. But an uptick all the same.<br>
<br>
While the visitors had been allowed the freedom - such as it was - to choose where to bed down the night before, inspections were a little more formal, and visitors were expected to secure themselves with their hosts. The Plaza girls were directed to distribute themselves between the two empty eye-hooks on the other side of Nineteen, however, and so it was just Sarah, Sophie, Catherine, and Erin locked in together on this side of the room. One big, twisted, happy family.<br>
<br>
Inspection was one thing. Though it wasn't particularly pleasant to be up on her toes, with her hands behind her head, as Mistress Rei ran a finger over her body to check for stubble, Erin had already been through this once before, the previous afternoon. The "confessional" portion of the exercise, in which the girls were required to report any and all instances of sexual activity that had occurred the night before, was a new and fresh hell. While Mistress Rei stood before them with her tablet, tapping it all in and saving it for posterity, each of them confessed their sins.<br>
<br>
"Once, by myself," Sophie offered, starting it all off. "Ten minutes. Two orgasms. Three, and then a two." Session. Duration. Count. Intensity of each.<br>
<br>
"Once, by myself," Erin stated flatly when it was her turn. "Ten minutes. Five orgasms. Four, maybe, on a scale. Three? And then two, two, and two." It might have been fifteen minutes; Sophie was finished before her, after all. And it might have actually been six orgasms - Erin wasn't sure - but she thought it preferable to low-ball the number. Same with her guesstimate on the intensity of each; her first, when she'd been caught in the act, was decidedly a five. Three's and two's were on the low side, as well - Erin couldn't remember having cum like that before last night. The need. The desperation. The release.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei smiled wickedly, and observed, "You are a naughty little slut, aren't you?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, mistress," was all Erin offered in response.<br>
<br>
"Just like your sisters," the Japanese woman purred.<br>
<br>
Stepsisters, Erin said to herself.<br>
<br>
"Once with Plaza Seven and Plaza Ten," Sarah said when it was her turn. "Fingers and oral. Fifteen minutes. Two orgasms. Five and five, both."<br>
<br>
She went on. "Once with Plaza Twenty-One. Oral. Five minutes. One orgasm. It was another five, mistress."<br>
<br>
But she wasn't done. "Once by myself. Five minutes. One orgasm. Another five."<br>
<br>
Erin knew about the first. She'd witnessed the second. But she'd been with Sarah for the remainder of the night, and wasn't sure when her stepsister had had an opportunity to sneak that last one in. Could she have...no!...but, could she have...? Could she have gotten herself off on the floor last night, after they'd bedded down, with Erin sleeping just a few feet away?<br>
<br>
Erin shuddered.<br>
<br>
The revelations were far from over. "Once," Catherine answered next, and Erin stiffened. "With Visitor F. Oral. And...uh...fingers. Fifteen minutes. One orgasm." The older woman hesitated, but then offered, "Five."<br>
<br>
No more wondering about why Catherine and Angela had turned in early last night. No more wondering if something had happened between Catherine and Mailgirl Fourteen's mother. It was all out there now.<br>
<br>
It was more than Erin had ever wanted to know. Maybe she should have been upset at her stepmother for cheating on her father, even if it was with a woman. Erin didn't linger on this question, however - these were extenuating circumstances. Erin had no interest in breaking the news to Patrick Ryan. Erin had no interest in confronting her stepmother. Erin had no interest in thinking about Catherine and Angela going down on one another here in the locker room.<br>
<br>
After all, was she really in any position to judge?<br>
<br>
The girls were restricted from speaking during inspections. And so this news, this confession, hung out there awkwardly as Mistress Rei moved on to Mailgirl Number Three.<br>
<br>
Most of the girls had something to confess, it seemed. There were a few - Mailgirl Seven, Visitor C, and Mailgirl Fourteen, for instance - who had nothing to report. But the vast majority had, at the very least, gotten themselves off on their own. And there was a tangled web of who had slept with whom that Erin tried to keep straight - even if the numbers, letters, and duplicates from the Plaza made it a difficult exercise. Mailgirl Six's number got called out more than once, though everyone in the room - everyone but Mistress Rei - knew that there was some artificial inflation in her sum total.<br>
<br>
"Once, with Mailgirl Number Six," Mailgirl Five had lied, after first copping to the solo session earlier in the evening. "Fingers and oral. Ten minutes. Three orgasms. First was a Five. Second was a Four. Third was a Four."<br>
<br>
"Once, with Mailgirl Number Six," Visitor B said when it was her turn. "Fingers and oral. Ten minutes. Four orgasms. Five, four, five, and five."<br>
<br>
"You do get around," Mistress Rei cooed at Mailgirl Six.<br>
<br>
"This girl is good at what she does," Six replied snarkily.<br>
<br>
The night before, in the aftermath of the "race" between Plaza Twenty-One and Six, Erin overheard a snippet of conversation between Sarah and the mailgirl from downtown. "Don't beat yourself up - that was amazing," she reassured Plaza Twenty-One, consoling her for the second-place finish. "Six has had a lot of practice. A lot, a lot, a lot of practice. It was her way of making it up to the other girls, for putting them on her list of mailgirl candidates."<br>
<br>
Whether or not Five and her sister had clued Six in on the lie ahead of time, Six covered for them. She listed each of their designations when it was her turn. Her own list was expansive, and Erin wasn't sure if she should have been offended that Six hadn't tried anything with her.<br>
<br>
It was some time before Mistress Rei made it all the way down the line. Not only were there fourteen extra girls whom she had to inspect, but there were also fourteen extra girls for whom she needed to play confessor, and whose disclosures she needed to enter into the system for record-keeping. Erin doubted that this exercise usually took this long; last night had apparently been a wild one, even by Park Place's standards.<br>
<br>
When they were finally, mercifully, let up off their knees, there was only one thing that Sarah and Sophie wanted to talk about. But detail into Catherine's confession would have to wait, at least temporarily. The Plaza girls were instructed to remain behind, but Mailgirls One and Two, and their other guests, were assigned responsibility for cleaning up the employee lounge on the 2nd Floor. A handful of others, including Mailgirl Fourteen (and by default, her mother), were to report to the gym, for being over their weights, even if only marginally so. Another few were sent back to the troughs for another serving of mailgirl chow for being under.<br>
<br>
"Ten o'clock," Mistress Rei barked, and punched the deadline into her tablet. The smartphones affixed to the mailgirls' arms all came alive at once, registering the assignment. "1st Floor atrium, by the Middlesex Courtyard. For gifts. Don't be late."<br>
<br>
It was nice, in its own twisted way, to get time alone as a family, away from the rest of the mailgirls. Even if that time away was spent mop in-hand, cleaning up the excesses of the night before. Sarah and Sophie led the way, sprinting up to the 2nd Floor. They didn't have a deadline to meet - not for this exercise, at least - but it was almost a force of habit. Sarah would later explain that if she didn't get a jog in, she'd start going a bit stir crazy.<br>
<br>
The smell of sex - of pussy, more accurately - was overpowering when they first entered the employee lounge. The girls hadn't trashed the room completely, but there were empty bottles of booze and half-drunken cocktail glasses everywhere. The mailgirl mats needed to be collected and redistributed throughout the building, and the furniture all needed to be put back in its proper places. What remained of the hors d'oeuvres and desserts would be trashed, and what little remained of the liquor needed to be boxed up and brought back down to Mistress Rei's room on B2.<br>
<br>
First, though, Sarah poured a shot glass full of the vile cherry liqueur. She slid it across the bar to her mother.<br>
<br>
Erin, along with Visitor H, had each been awarded such a drink. It was a ritual the mailgirls celebrated, for when a girl "popped her cherry" and masturbated in public the first time. Erin had played with herself in a far less public setting than had Visitor H; but she'd done so all the same, and it seemed impolite to protest and point out the difference.<br>
<br>
"Be careful," Sophie had warned her. "The first time is a gateway diddle."<br>
<br>
"To the slightly less embarrassing nature of subsequent sessions of self-pleasure!" Sarah had cheered, toasted, and slugged back a drink of her own, to the roar, applause, and participation of the rest of the room.<br>
<br>
Now it was Catherine's turn.<br>
<br>
"It's seven thirty in morning," she protested.<br>
<br>
"Do the crime..." Sophie began.<br>
<br>
Knowing she was licked, Catherine grimaced and took the glass.<br>
<br>
"It'll help wash the taste of breakfast out of your mouth," Erin offered helpfully.<br>
<br>
Catherine shot her stepdaughter a skeptical look, and then knocked the drink back. She scrunched up her face, stuck out her tongue, and coughed. "I think I prefer the taste of the mailgirl chow."<br>
<br>
They all laughed.<br>
<br>
"So..." Sophie teased. "...Visitor F?"<br>
<br>
Catherine smiled, and said demurely, "She was gentle." She chuckled to herself, and then went the other way. "No, she definitely wasn't."<br>
<br>
"Ew! Ew! Ew!" Sarah came back. "No, let's not do this!"<br>
<br>
"You're one to talk!" Catherine replied. "Anyone here you didn't sleep with last night?"<br>
<br>
Sophie raised her hand. Erin, too.<br>
<br>
Catherine hinted around the details. And though Sarah and Sophie both - but Sarah, in particular - made a show of recoiling and acting weirded out by their mother's admissions, neither could help herself from asking follow-up questions.<br>
<br>
"You know there are cameras in the locker room, right?" Sophie asked at one point, while stacking the mailgirl mats by the door. Erin hadn't noticed the cameras, herself, but it didn't surprise her in the least. She'd seen pictures of the Park Place locker room online, but they were all amateur-style shots, taken through the mirror glass. Human Capital, though, likely had thousands of hours of footage stored away somewhere, perhaps for the purposes of contract renegotiation somewhere down the line. "The stairs. The hallways."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure they're in here, too. This place is probably crawling with hidden cameras and bugged to shit," Sarah added. She looked up from the box she was squatting in front, where she was gathering half-filled bottles of liquor. Addressing the room, and asked, "Isn't that right, Will?"<br>
<br>
"The bathroom. Or one of the cubicles. That's where you should have gone," Sophie went on.<br>
<br>
The revelation didn't seem to bother Catherine all that much, however. "We didn't leave the party thinking anything was going to happen."<br>
<br>
"Maybe you didn't," Sarah replied. "Fourteen's mom is here every couple of weeks. It's like a fetish she and Fourteen's dad have."<br>
<br>
"But maybe better you than one of the other girls," Sophie offered. "She lured Seventeen back here once, back before Seventeen and Eighteen were a thing."<br>
<br>
"Thirteen, too," from Sarah. "I think she's got kind of an Asian thing. Usually."<br>
<br>
"Alright, alright," Catherine said, throwing up her hands. "Not important. But I didn't leave the party thinking it was a foregone conclusion. I just wanted to give you girls some space, some privacy. And, honestly, I was tired - it was a long afternoon."<br>
<br>
Whatever Angela Giannini's game had been, and however much she might have preyed upon Catherine, it had been a slow and subtle pursuit. They'd gotten ready for bed, used the bathroom one last time, and chosen to go to sleep on the far end of the room, leashing themselves to one of the empty eye-hooks as far away from Sarah and Sophie's usual spot as possible. Neither had been able to fall asleep. Both complained about the hardship of their older bodies trying to get comfortable on the tiled floor. Both confessed to being excited and aroused from their exposure, of being seen as objects of sexual desire to people other than their own husbands. Somewhere along the way, Angela had cuddled up to Catherine. Somewhere along the way, Catherine had begun caressing Angela's hip. And then, before any of the other girls had returned from the party upstairs, something else had happened, and Catherine hadn't been able to slow it down. She hadn't wanted to.<br>
<br>
She had no regrets. Of Erin's father, she offered, "Even if I told him - and I'm not going to - I think he'd forgive me. For being with another woman, at least." In Erin's direction, she added, "Ben would, too."<br>
<br>
Erin didn't bother turning around. She continued scrubbing the counter with a sponge. She deflected, joking, "I don't want to sleep with Fourteen's mother."<br>
<br>
"You know what I mean."<br>
<br>
"I know what you mean," Erin conceded. Ben didn't have a single jealous bone in his body, a virtue that Erin had twisted into a fault on more than one occasion. A virtue that she was taking advantage of, undressing in a lobby full of strangers and parading around naked in an office building on the far side of the country.<br>
<br>
She was curious, of course, about the idea of being with another girl. She didn't know any of her friends who hadn't confessed to that same curiosity, and she knew of a few of her sorority sisters who'd realized said curiosity at one point or another before graduation. Soft skin. Soft lips. Soft touches. Sure, it was a fantasy. But, though Ben might very well have been perfectly fine with the idea, and might have even been turned on if she'd confessed to such a dalliance when she got home, it wasn't something she was going to act on today, tonight, tomorrow morning. She'd already given in and masturbated here once. There was a begrudging certainty that she'd do it again, before this little adventure was through. But she didn't need to add to her sins by getting hot and heavy with Mailgirl Six, or Mailgirl Fourteen, or one of the Plaza girls.<br>
<br>
"I think Ben will just be happy to have me home, with all this out of my system," Erin said, finally.<br>
<br>
If she were allowed to go home.<br>
<br>
If Mistress Rei didn't help her make that morning's Christmas wish come true.<br>
<br>
If there were any chance that "all this" would ever be out of her system.<br>
<br>
She swallowed hard, and continued to scrub.<br>
<br>
Catherine wasn't through, however. "I think he'd surprise you," she told her stepdaughter. "I think he knows you better than you think he does."<br>
<br>
No, Ben didn't have a jealous bone in his body. When she'd told him about Ethan Weiland - an 11th grader in her second period class last year - and how she'd caught Ethan trying to look up her skirt one particular morning when she crossed her legs in front of the class, Ben had just laughed and offered the boy praise in absentia for his boldness. Erin hadn't confessed that she had been more excited and aroused than creeped out by the violation. But she had scolded Ben for not being more jealous, all the same. How could he not be jealous?<br>
<br>
"Let him look. Let him fantasize," Ben had laughed. "It's me that gets to sleep with you when the day's all through."<br>
<br>
Would sleeping with another girl violate that laissez-faire attitude?<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," Ben had told her at the airport.<br>
<br>
Sweeping and vacuuming was one thing. Cleaning up empty glasses and collecting the assorted porno mags was fine. As Erin scrubbed the counters, however, she found herself wondering how much of the sticky mess was spilled drinks, and how much it was pussy and sweat. She wondered what Ben was doing that morning. She wondered why she had insisted upon spending Christmas morning this way, doing this, away from him.<br>
<br>
Erin needed to pee at one point, and needed Sophie to escort her. Or, more accurately, needed the smartphone on Sophie's arm to let her through the locked doors and out to the men's room. They passed by Erin's cubicle from the night before, and Erin couldn't resist a peek in, to see it in the full light of day, and to make sure she hadn't left any sign of her own bodily fluids behind. There was no sweaty outline of her bare behind on the rug, and any imagined whiff of pussy could very well have been coming from either her or Sophie here and now.<br>
<br>
In fact, it struck Erin how mundane and boring the site of her crime was. How regular. The office chair was still scooched over to one side, leaving just enough room for a fully-grown girl to lie down on the floor beside it. But it was like any other cubicle anywhere else in the world - a stack of print-outs piled neatly in one corner, a pair of pens lined up alongside the mouse pad, a phone and a computer and a keyboard. A picture of a couple was tacked to one wall, as was a comic strip Erin didn't recognize.<br>
<br>
"Heidi Pomeranz," the nameplate by the entrance read. A woman's cubicle, after all. Erin wondered who Heidi Pomeranz was. What she did. How she'd react if she knew a naked mailgirl - a naked mailgirl wannabe - had gotten herself off at her workstation over Christmas break.<br>
<br>
"We're going to have to clean in here, too," Sophie remarked glumly as they entered the men's room. There was a plastic party cup, still half-filled with booze, on the counter. There was another that had spilled by the trash. One of the urinals was unflushed, and had been very obviously been put into use by one of the girls last night, in a feat that Erin wasn't sure she understood the mechanics of; a few splashes on the floor signaled it hadn't been done completely without error.<br>
<br>
Erin glanced at the counter. She hadn't witnessed the incident herself, but it had been the source of gossip and whispers all night. And Visitor B had been cheered and toasted, and treated to her own shot of cherry liqueur, for the heinous act with her sister. So it wasn't exactly a secret, even if Mailgirl Six had been inserted into the story when they had recounted it to Mistress Rei that morning. What could have possibly possessed Visitor B and Mailgirl Five that they'd crossed that line? How did such a thing even happen?<br>
<br>
Erin propped her stall door open, like a good mailgirl, and sat down to pee. Sophie did the same in the handicapped stall beside her.<br>
<br>
"So...Mailgirl Five?" Erin asked. She wasn't sure what she was even asking. She supposed she just wanted to gossip with Sophie about what had happened.<br>
<br>
She was greeted with silence.<br>
<br>
No, Erin told herself.<br>
<br>
No, no, no.<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
No!<br>
<br>
No!!<br>
<br>
What?!!<br>
<br>
Sophie's silent pause spoke volumes. The pause said more than Sophie ever could have. The pause spoke to something vile and unthinkable.<br>
<br>
Sophie cleared her throat. "It's..."<br>
<br>
Another pause. Another silence. Another moment for Erin's brain to explode.<br>
<br>
They met each other at the sinks, and Sophie made a show of washing her hands, and collecting the errant cup. She wanted to tell Erin, but she didn't. She wanted to explain herself, but she couldn't. At this point, she knew that Erin knew, and that her reaction had been awkward enough that Erin knew the whole thing, even if she didn't know the details. Sophie needed to explain herself.<br>
<br>
"Don't tell my sister that I told you," Sophie warned. "And don't breathe a word of this to my mother. "<br>
<br>
"Sophie," Erin replied, "I'm not even sure that I want to know." She went un-corrected for her use of Sophie's proper name.<br>
<br>
Sophie took a deep breath. "It's just that you spend your whole day, hour after hour, getting called a slut and a whore. And, honestly? I'm kind of a slut and a whore. No, I am a slut and a whore. I'll own it. This exhibitionism thing, this submission thing, this control thing - it's dirty, it's depraved, it's 'naughty.' And one you're already in that place?"<br>
<br>
She went on. "You have to understand. Whatever the mailgirls are to people, the idea of sisters is on some other level. We're like a fucking circus act. We're not allowed to touch each other - you know, intimately - outside of the locker room. And, even inside, it's...like...just seven until nine. Saturdays, too, I guess. We're not allowed to touch ourselves, either, when we're on duty. So there are limits. We can't do it. And they can't tell us to do it."<br>
<br>
"Right," Erin nodded. She understood that much.<br>
<br>
"But there's a lot of wiggle room, and a lot of freedom, in what you can ask a mailgirl to do, right up to that line. A lot of the time, it's just mean shit - sadistic shit - without it being sexual or sex-related. Playground shit. Number Seven had to eat dead fly once. But a lot of the time, most of the time, there's an element of testing the limits. Like, 'Suck on her nipple' or 'Touch her pussy' or 'Kiss her' type stuff. Every single one of us has done that sort of thing with one another. We've been forced to do that sort of thing with one another. With sisters, though? It's that, on steroids."<br>
<br>
Sophie avoided Erin's eye contact. Instead, she looked only at her own reflection in the mirror.<br>
<br>
"So, Sarah and I... Two and I. Don't slap me. We get dared and ordered and blackmailed into all sorts of nonsense. It is what it is. Nipple-licking, pussy-touching, tongue-kissing, and all that. And it's just - I don't know - we hit a point one night, when it was just the two of us, and we were both horny as shit, and both going to touch ourselves anyways, and it just sort of happened. We've touched ourselves next to each other like hundreds of times now, and been there in the room when the other one got off. But this time, it was different, and it was like a 'I don't care how dirty this is - I'm just going for it" sort of thing. It was a Saturday night. We were alone. We'd snuck off, just like you and I did last night, but into one of the supply rooms. And, fuck if it wasn't the dirtiest shit I'd ever done. But, like, dirty in a way that was hot."<br>
<br>
Erin shook her head. "I'm not sure I..."<br>
<br>
"I knew it was wrong. Of course I knew it was wrong. And she knew it was wrong, too. But it was wrong in that exact right way, where it was happening without a lot of higher brain functioning. I've been with, I don't know, like...half of the locker room at this point. Maybe a third? She's not a 'technique' sort of girl, even given as much practice as she's had with the Plaza mailgirls. She's not as good as, like, Six. Or Sixteen. But I came so hard, so fast, so furious - the foulness of it all was exactly what it made it as hot as it was."<br>
<br>
Erin didn't know what to say. What was she supposed to say? How was she supposed to react to a confession such as this? "No, Sophie, I get it," she lied. "It's another world in here."<br>
<br>
Sophie shook her head. "So, that was the first time..."<br>
<br>
It had happened more than once. On four separate instances, to hear Sophie tell it. It had been awkward in the aftermath of that first time, Sophie admitted. Uncomfortable. Their only saving grace had been that the other girls didn't know. They all knew that Sophie and Sarah might masturbate with one another every now and then. And that was weird. But not that weird. Not any weirder than any of the girls masturbating with any of the other girls - something that was commonplace enough here at Park Place. And, so, even when they'd gotten together again for a second time, none of the other Park Place girls were any the wiser, or aware that something else had happened between them.<br>
<br>
But then Sophie had spilled the beans to Six, and it was pretty soon after that that everyone knew. And even that hadn't stopped Sarah and Sophie for doing it again. It was precisely because it was so wrong that it felt as adventurous and naughty as it had, so warped and so wicked and so wanton. Sarah and Sophie didn't have a standing thing. Each time it had happened, they'd sworn to one another that it'd never happen again. And, yet...<br>
<br>
And, yet...<br>
<br>
And, yet...<br>
<br>
The revelation was head-exploding. Erin returned to the employee lounge with her mind still racing, and unable to engage either Sarah or Catherine in any sort of conversation. How was she going to carry on a normal conversation with Sarah, now knowing what she knew? How was she supposed to pretend everything was fine when talking to Catherine? How was she going to be able to think about anything else?<br>
<br>
She wanted to leave and go home. Her things were in the basement, a floor down from the locker room. Sophie knew where. She wasn't a mailgirl - not really. There'd be no financial penalties if she tapped out. She was visiting. Volunteering. Here entirely of her own volition. She could put back on her skirt, her blouse, and her coat, and wait for Catherine back at the hotel. She'd been naked for less than twenty-four hours, and she wanted almost nothing more than put her clothes back on, and put all of this behind her. She wanted to be with Ben and his family in Santa Barbara, unwrapping presents with his nieces and nephews in her pajamas. She wanted to put on a Christmas outfit, and sit down and have a normal Christmas dinner with her in-laws.<br>
<br>
This didn't seem fun anymore. This didn't seem like an adventure she wanted to be a part of anymore. This wasn't her Christmas wish, whatever she'd said to Mistress Zero.<br>
<br>
But Erin still dutifully mopped the men's room floor while Catherine scrubbed the toilets. She carried the mailgirl mats with Sarah, and redistributed them throughout the building. She hefted the boxes full of half-filled liquor bottles downstairs, and left them outside Mistress Rei's room on B2. She couldn't leave. Not yet.<br>
<br>
There'd been a sense of gloom in the locker room that morning, something of a hangover - both actual and emotional - from the night before. Last night, with a special holiday "Bitch Session" on the 2nd Floor, there'd been excitement and anticipation and freedom. Today, though, despite the fact that they still had the bulk of the day "off" from regular mailgirl duties, they'd still been expected to submit themselves for inspection, to make weight, to clean up their mess, to choke down breakfast from the trough, to handle a myriad of other petty little tasks and chores. This wasn't fantasy. This was reality.<br>
<br>
Sophie's confession had only underlined how wrong this all was - what USF was doing to these girls, and what these girls were doing to themselves.<br>
<br>
And so, far from the joy a child might feel on Christmas morning, there was a sense of dread when they arrived at the atrium for Christmas presents. No doubt that whatever awaited them would only humiliate them and de-humanize them that much more.<br>
<br>
But that sense of dread was back-burnered, at least momentarily, when Erin looked out upon the courtyard and saw that it was snowing. Her heart skipped a beat. She was a California girl, who'd gone to college in the desert, and then had settled in LA. She couldn't remember the last time she'd seen snow. The courtyard was decked out for the holiday - oversized plastic candy-canes, wooden gingerbread men with big, fake gumdrop buttons, and evergreens lining the walkway leading towards a yurt-like structure done up like an igloo in the center. Erin doubted that this had been done for the mailgirls; the greater likelihood was that this was for USF's regular employees, for some sort of holiday party or event. Snow was falling, and was accumulating everywhere, blanketing the scene in virgin white. It seemed innocent and pure. A little gaudy, perhaps. But it seemed like Christmas.<br>
<br>
Going out into the snow, wearing nothing but her collar, was daunting. And, as Sarah opened the door to the outside, a blast of arctic air chilled Erin to the core. Her nipples hardened reflexively, and she shivered. A path hadn't been shoveled, but there was a trail leading to the igloo all the same, the snow flattened down the bare footprints of a dozen or more other girls ahead of her. Catherine, Erin, Sarah, and Sophie hurried the igloo, tip-toeing through the snow, with each subsequent step numbing Erin's feet that much further.<br>
<br>
The interior of the yurt-turned-faux-igloo stood in marked contrast to the winter outside. In fact, it was probably a good twenty-some degrees warmer inside than even in the halls and corridors of Park Place proper. After the dash through the snow, it felt positively sub-tropical inside, space-heaters and body heat ratcheting the temperature up well into the nineties.<br>
<br>
It was a decent-sized space, but not necessarily one designed to accommodate thirty-three naked mailgirls and their mistress. It felt tight and cramped. Erin's arm brushed up against a girl over here, and her bare behind bumped the bare hip of another over there. A Christmas tree stood tall against the back wall, with presents scattered beneath it. And an imposing chair - gold paint and red velvet - was beside it; Santa's "throne," obviously. Seated upon it, and presiding over this deranged scene, was Mistress Rei, still done up in her outfit from that morning. Her bull whip dangled to her right, and she played with the handle menacingly.<br>
<br>
There were no snacks or treats laid out, like there had been in the employee lounge the night before. But there was coffee, hot chocolate, and even a limited selection of Kahlua, Bailey's, and crème-de-menthe. Erin helped herself to the coffee, sweetened it with four sugars, and added cream. She chose to hold off on liquor; memories of last night's peppermint schnapps and cherry liqueur still had her feeling queasy.<br>
<br>
For the mailgirls, coffee alone was an indulgence. Outside of Saturday nights, they drank water - morning, noon, and night. For many of them, adjusting to life without caffeine had been every bit as challenging to adjusting to life without clothes. Some, more so.<br>
<br>
But there were presents - actual presents - for them to unwrap. When the last of the girls had squeezed into the igloo, Mistress Rei barked and ordered them onto their behinds. Erin sat, legs crossed Indian-style, and put her coffee down in front of her. Catherine was to her right. Sarah and Sophie were on the other side of their mother. Erin was two or three rows back from Mistress Rei's throne, staring at the bare backs of other girls in front of her.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei opened by explaining that she only had gifts for her mailgirls, and that these were gifts selected by the Director of Human Capital, himself - albeit with some input from Mistress Rei and the Human Capital staff. To the visitors, and the Plaza girls, too, she offered an apology dripping with sarcasm, but promised that she'd try to make their Christmas wishes come true, all the same. She looked in Erin's direction as she said this, and Erin bit her lip.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the Japanese woman specified that she'd need to confiscate these presents tonight, before bedtime, but that the girls would be allowed to play with them and enjoy them as they saw fit until then. The girls were forbidden personal items of any kind, but Mistress Rei purred that she was happy to hold onto them, as party favors for Saturday nights. Or, as rewards for girls with low demerit totals. Or citations for "exemplary service."<br>
<br>
There was little question as to what the gift-wrapped boxes under the tree held. Sex toys. Erin knew it without doubt.<br>
<br>
And, on that regard, Erin wasn't wrong. Sophie was called up first, and given her present.<br>
<br>
"You can fit sex in a box?" she joked, to polite laughter from her audience.<br>
<br>
Even Mistress Rei cracked a smile. "We tried," she allowed, smiling.<br>
<br>
She didn't disappoint. As Sophie delicately tore the wrapping paper from her box, Erin craned her neck for a better view. And, sure enough, Sophie gasped, laughed, and pulled a bright pink, silicone dildo from inside. From behind Erin, one of the mailgirls hooted in appreciation.<br>
<br>
Sophie's present was part of a set, however. The girls discovered this fact when it was Sarah's turn, and she unwrapped a black-and-pink harness, to be worn about the midsection. Borrowing Sophie's dildo momentarily, the toy snapped into place with a "click." Mistress Rei and her masters had given the Scott sisters a strap-on.<br>
<br>
Beside Erin, Catherine made not a peep. Erin kept her eyes forward, not wanting to acknowledge the presents in the presence of her stepmother.<br>
<br>
And so it went. Dildos and vibrators, in a variety of different shapes and colors. A personal massager. Stream-lined vibrators and realistic-looking fake cocks in gaudy shades of pink, purple, and red. Butt plugs and anal beads. Nipple clamps. A double-headed dildo. And on and on. The mood of the room began to shift sometime around Mailgirl Five, and took on the air of a particularly naughty bachelorette party. The girls weren't as free or abandoned as they'd been in the orgy-like heights of the party from the night before, likely due to the intimidating presence of their mistress in their midst. And no one was so bold as to put their new toy to use then and there - though a number of them pretended to do so while laughing and cackling all the while. These girls were being humiliated and toyed with once more, but they were complicit in their embarrassment; the larger world, and the surely mean-spirited nature of the gifts, were pushed aside. The girls themselves chose to think about what they'd be able to do with them later that afternoon.<br>
<br>
Not all of the gifts were meant for insertion, however. Each of Park Place's mailgirls received a little piece of jewelry: a new number, decked out in fake diamonds and other assorted bling, to wear on their collar. Mistress Rei replaced the old numbers - delicate-looking silver tags that stood in marked contrast to the ugliness of the collars - on a few of the girls, and then granted the rest the freedom to do so for themselves or for each other. Erin felt a pang of jealousy as Sarah and Sophie were fitted with theirs, weirdly disappointed with the simple, unadorned letter "D" that hung from her own collar, a loaner.<br>
<br>
There was a glittery ball-gag that one of the girls unwrapped. A paddle. A set of eye-masks that had been bedazzled with the words "Slut" and "Dyke" and "Juicy." A spreader bar, not entirely dissimilar to the one that Six had been outfitted with yesterday in the stocks.<br>
<br>
For Six, there was even a pack of Parliament Lights, and a lighter to go with it.<br>
<br>
"You owe me a few of those," Mailgirl Eleven laughed.<br>
<br>
"Outside," Mistress Rei warned them.<br>
<br>
"Fuck it," Six answered back. She elbowed her way towards the door, and announced, "If anyone else wants one..."<br>
<br>
Erin could feel the sense of disapproval from her stepmother as she joined the contingent by the exit. Erin didn't smoke. Not really. It had been months since she'd last lit up with one of the other faculty members at her school. It was a pastime she'd never fully succumbed to, but one that was an occasional indulgence, all the same. She felt that she'd earned it, though. That she needed it. Even if that meant standing outside and enjoying it in the snow.<br>
<br>
The cold was bracing as Erin stepped from the igloo. But - at least at first - it was a welcome relief from the hot and sweaty interior. She and Six weren't alone; they were joined by Mailgirl Eleven and Visitors H and I. Six lit two cigarettes at once, passed one to Erin, and thenhanded the pack and lighter to Eleven.<br>
<br>
They huddled close together, luxuriating in the smell of tobacco and the feel of smoke in their lungs, while suffering the cold, wet misery of that December morning. Erin danced from foot to foot, and rubbed her arms in a futile effort to stay warm. Six put her arm around Erin's waist, and pulled her close, goose-flesh upon goose-flesh. It was worth it. It felt like she was being a "bad girl" in a whole different way.<br>
<br>
When they came back inside, Erin found her coffee cup - or what she believed was her coffee cup, as there were dozens of them here, there, and everywhere - and filled it back up. This time, she gave herself a liberal dose of Irish cream. She hardly ever smoked. But when she did, it was usually when she was drinking. One went hand-in-hand with the other.<br>
<br>
What these girls really wanted, Erin bet, was an escape. A "Get Out of Jail Free" card. A holiday. A day pass, even. The opportunity to get dressed and leave the building - even just for a few hours. Neither Sarah nor Sophie had worn clothes since August. For others, it had been nearly as long. As much as Erin had wanted to be a mailgirl, the mailgirls no doubt wanted out.<br>
<br>
Sarah shook her head, when Erin suggested as much. "Don't get me wrong," Sarah replied. She was distracted. She was laughing and watching as Sophie, wearing the harness and strap-on, pantomimed a quick fuck. Catherine was blushing, a hand over her eyes, but giggling along. "Don't get me wrong, I want it. I'd love to be done with this, and on the other side. To put on clothes and go home. To be by myself, in the privacy of my own bedroom. But a day pass? To leave and then have to come back? I'm not sure I'm strong enough for that anymore."<br>
<br>
To hear Sarah tell it, it was easier to be a mailgirl at Park Place than it had been at the Plaza. It was counterintuitive, she conceded. But it was true.<br>
<br>
At the Plaza, Sarah had twelve hours on, twelve hours off. Maybe it had been more like thirteen or fourteen hours on, she admitted, once she factored in time spent in the locker room before and after her shifts - showering and shaving, among other things. But at the end of each day, she'd been allowed to get dressed and go home. She was released back out into the real world. And, for a few hours, she could wear clothes and pretend she wasn't a mailgirl anymore.<br>
<br>
Only, she couldn't. Any sense of relief she felt at the end of her day was short-lived, as she almost immediately began counting down to the start of her next shift the following morning. She dreaded it. She feared it. The following morning, she'd have to strip down and submit all over again. She'd have to surrender her clothes and surrender her dignity anew. It was like having to make the decision to become a mailgirl again, and again, and again. In the face of all that, and with the Whitestocking encampments just outside the building's doors, the simple choice of showing up at work or not was torment.<br>
<br>
At Park Place? Sarah was a mailgirl, through and through. She wasn't trying to balance another life outside of this one. She wasn't faced with the temptation to run screaming into the arms of the Whitestockings. She wasn't forced to go through the ritual of undressing each and every morning. She was in it. She was in it all the way.<br>
<br>
Jersey City hadn't lost a single mailgirl recruit since the program began. The Plaza, by contrast, seemed to suffer a defection every month or two. The girls of Park Place weren't prisoners - not really. They were welcome to walk out and leave this life behind whenever they decided they couldn't take it anymore. But they stayed. They stayed because they were mailgirls, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week. They stayed because this was who they were now, and there was no hiding from it. No half-in and half-out. No part-timers.<br>
<br>
Erin took a sip from her cup. It made sense, in its way. If she were to do this, if she were to become a mailgirl, she supposed she should do it all the way. Could she go home every night to Ben, tell him about her day, and then do it all again the following morning? It seemed kinder - to him and to her, both - for there to be some distance. For her to stay on-site. For her to surrender to this life totally and completely.<br>
<br>
She was wet just thinking about it.

"You can undress here. He's waiting for you."<br>
<br>
It was the morning of the 26th. Catherine Ryan was on a flight back to SFO. Sarah and Sophie Scott had returned to their normal routines in Jersey City as Park Place Mailgirls One and Two. Ben O'Neill was likely getting ready for his own return to work in LA. And Erin Ryan O'Neill had been shipped, in a dog carrier, to USF Plaza in the heart of the Financial District.<br>
<br>
Unlike the Plaza mailgirls who'd been packed up and returned to their usual haunts in downtown Manhattan, though, Erin had been allowed to get dressed. Was it more humiliating to crawl out of her crate wearing her boots, her blouse, and her skirt? Or less? It should have been the latter, but Erin felt more the former. She was alone in her clothes - special, unique, different. She alone had been allowed to cover her shame, and she felt ashamed for it. She'd been herded into her box the same as Plaza Seven, Plaza Ten, Plaza Seventeen, Plaza Eighteen, and Plaza Twenty-One. But only Erin was fully dressed, wearing the same outfit she'd worn into the Park Place lobby on Christmas Eve.<br>
<br>
Most of it, at least. "Fully dressed," in this instance, meant she had arrived at the Plaza devoid of her panties and bra. Her underthings had been "donated" to the cause, pilfered from her luggage and en route to some unknown USF executive as a belated Christmas gift, or as a prize for meeting some sort of year-end sales goal. Or something like that. Honestly, she felt like she missed her bra more than her underwear; her tits jiggled as she walked, as she climbed from her crate, as she was bumped and bounced in the back of the delivery truck. Her skirt had, admittedly, become little more than a belt on the ride over, bunched up around her waist with her sex exposed and her legs spread. There'd been simply nothing to be have done about that fact, given that she'd been crammed into such a confined space with Plaza Eighteen - their legs and arms tangled, their bodies pressed up against one another, and the naked brunette's hot breath on her neck.<br>
<br>
Only three dog carriers had come over to Park Place on Christmas Eve, and only three were available to transport the six girls back. Plaza Seven and Plaza Ten had ridden together in one carrier, and Plaza Twenty-One had joined Plaza Seventeen in another. Plaza Eighteen had volunteered to ride with Visitor D, with a smile and a grimace. She had climbed in and on top of her clothed traveling companion as Erin had awkwardly tried to accommodate another fully-grown girl in a space designed for a single large-breed dog. They'd made small talk, but had avoided the topic most pressing on Erin's mind.<br>
<br>
Erin was to become a USF mailgirl. Mistress Rei and Will Barrow were going to help her make her Christmas wish come true.<br>
<br>
Erin was allowed to use the restroom when she had arrived, and she'd taken the opportunity to do so. In limbo between being a mailgirl and not being a mailgirl, she'd been unsure of what was expected of her. She didn't have a chaperone down in the ladies' room just off the loading dock, but she'd left the stall door open all the same; she didn't want to come into this with a full slate of demerits so early on. But, though she'd relieved herself before heading up to the 18th Floor, she felt she could pee again. Nerves.<br>
<br>
Erin had passed through the "Hall of Panties" that led to Human Capital, greeted by thongs and bikinis and g-strings of the mailgirls who'd come before her. She was greeted by a young secretary outside of Will Barrow's office. The girl was still in her early twenties, and was dressed in a professional-if-tight-fitting outfit. She was friendly enough, and had met Erin with a smile. But that friendliness was coupled with a casual approach to Erin's debasement; Erin was to undress here, in front of her, before she'd be allowed in to meet with Barrow.<br>
<br>
"I haven't..." Erin objected, stumbling over her own words. "That is...I'm not a mailgirl. Not officially. Not yet. I'm not sure I even... I mean, I'm not sure that this is really, really right for me. I was just hoping to talk it through first. Informational-like."<br>
<br>
The secretary's only response was to shake her head, repeat the instruction, and look upon Erin with a mixture of sympathy and annoyance. How could anyone be this naïve? If Erin was to get past her, if Erin was to meet with her boss, if Erin was to discuss whether or not she'd become USF's next new mailgirl, she'd need to do so in the altogether.<br>
<br>
And so Erin did as she was told.<br>
<br>
She glanced nervously over her shoulder, and saw that one of Barrow's analysts had poked his head of his office. He called out to the office across the hall, and was joined by a second gentleman who laughed, made an inaudible joke, and shot Erin a lecherous grin.<br>
<br>
Erin put them both out of her mind, bent at the waist, and removed her boots. She left them on the floor, and then went for her ring. Bracelet. Earrings. Necklace. All were deposited in a neat little pile on the corner of the secretary's desk. Noticeably absent were Erin's engagement ring and her wedding band. She'd felt naked without them since leaving home - more so, even, than when she'd actually gotten naked in the Park Place lobby. She hadn't wanted to risk losing them on this trip. But perhaps more to the point, she hadn't wanted the constant reminder of what she was doing to her husband Ben. Not that this tactic had worked, entirely; their absence was reminder enough.<br>
<br>
She fumbled at the buttons of her blouse, one after another, untucking it from her flouncy A-line skirt as she reached the bottom. When she was through, she slid the sleeves down her arms, and bunched the fabric into messy pile - not quite folded up neatly, but neat enough for the moment. Her bare back was to the two men down the hall, but the secretary in front of her was given the full show. The younger woman gave Erin's tits a half-interested once-over. Given where she worked and for whom she worked, she'd clearly seen her fair share of naked breasts.<br>
<br>
Erin was directed to leave the blouse on the floor, beside her shoes. Sensing that the secretary didn't want any of Erin's things on her desk, she scooped up her jewelry, as well, and deposited it all into one of the boots. She bent over to place her shirt down on the carpet, self-conscious about the way her breasts dangled beneath her. And then, reluctantly, she hooked her thumbs into the waist of her skirt, and slipped her last remaining item of clothing down her thighs.<br>
<br>
Once the skirt had joined her blouse in a stack on the floor, Erin stood before the secretary unsure of what to do next. She resisted the instinct to cover her body with her hands, and opted for the "Feet" position - legs spread shoulder-width apart, shoulders back and tits out, head down, and hands behind her back.<br>
<br>
Barrow's secretary wasn't satisfied, however. "Toes," she ordered. Inspection position.<br>
<br>
Erin groaned internally, offered a perfunctory, "Yes, ma'am," and did as instructed. She rose to her tip-toes, locked her fingers behind the back of her head, and stared blankly off into the distance. Behind her, one of Barrow's analysts snickered.<br>
<br>
The secretary didn't rise from where she was seated, choosing instead to conduct the inspection from her desk. No sniff-test. No stubble-check. Nothing so up close and personal. Instead, she clucked a "Tisk-tisk," and directed her attention to the school of little fish tattooed upon Erin's hip.<br>
<br>
"He's not going to like that," the secretary opined. "That's not going work here at the Plaza. That's for sure."<br>
<br>
"Yes, ma'am," was all Erin offered in response. Her heart fluttered as she sensed an out. USF mailgirls were forbidden from having tattoos. Maybe, after all this humiliation was through, she'd be sent packing after all. Maybe she'd be able to exploit this loophole, and return home to LA, to her life, to her husband.<br>
<br>
"Maybe it'll be fine for Park Place," the other girl went on. "Or, I know we're expanding elsewhere..."<br>
<br>
Satisfied, however, that Erin passed muster, the secretary let the girl back down off her toes. She picked up the phone, enjoyed a brief exchange with Barrow on the end of the line, and then nodded to Erin. "You can go in."<br>
<br>
Erin had seen pictures of Will Barrow posted on Mailgirls Exposed and the Post Office. In fact, she'd even streamed a panel he'd been a part of with various representatives of the big Whitestocking and Blackstocking groups, debating the merits of the mailgirls concept and its future in the US. He'd been younger than she had expected - just maybe forty - and more handsome, put-together, and professional. He wasn't the creepy, slovenly pervert he might have been, a misogynistic "incel" taking out his frustrations with women upon the gorgeous mailgirls who might have spurned his advances previously. He was tall. He was smart. He was smooth. There was little doubt that Barrow could have landed any girl he wanted, even the most gorgeous of the high-end mailgirls he now held in his employ.<br>
<br>
Will Barrow owned Erin the moment she stepped into his office.<br>
<br>
He sized her up as she approached his desk. His eyes lingered longer than his secretary's had, but with a distance that bordered on that same casual disinterest. He'd done this before. He'd had naked girls in his office before. Any sexual excitement in the room belonged to Erin and Erin alone.<br>
<br>
"Feet," he ordered, gesturing to a spot in front of his desk.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Erin chirped back. She wasn't a mailgirl. Not yet. But she was already acting the part, all the same.<br>
<br>
"'Mister Barrow,'" he corrected her.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mister Barrow."<br>
<br>
He paused, thinking it over, and then shook his head. "Let's try, 'Yes, Master,' on for size."<br>
<br>
Erin swallowed. "Yes...yes, master."<br>
<br>
"Better. I like it. It suits you."<br>
<br>
"Yes, master."<br>
<br>
He had two manila envelopes on his desk, both labeled, "Ryan, Erin." Not "O'Neill, Erin." Her visitor's agreement - Erin wasn't sure if it was the one she'd sent in earlier, or the one she'd signed in the Park Place lobby - was with them. He met her eyes, and she submissively looked to the floor.<br>
<br>
"Let's get this nastiness out of way first," Barrow purred. He held up the 11-page visitor's agreement. "I'm sure you may have suspected this, but Legal did amend the agreement you'd sent back to us initially, and provided those updates for you to sign on Christmas Eve. You've been provided with an electronic copy, for your records; my assistant sent it to your personal e-mail this morning. It allows US Financial the option of exercising a full mailgirls contract, using your signature on the agreement here. Mostly standard issue. Two years. Rules. Restrictions. Regulations. Power of Attorney. Et cetera, et cetera."<br>
<br>
They'd fucked her. She'd known they would fuck her. And she'd signed the agreement at the security desk all the same.<br>
<br>
Barrow held up the first manila envelope. "In here? The upside. We're tripling the salary you're currently pulling down as a teacher. As even that still felt a little low, we padded your signing bonus, upped our standard completion bonus, and built in a few kickers for special assignments, good performance, and the like. Upon completion, both sides have rights to re-up the contract for another two years. After that, we'll review, and take it year-by-year, so long as you're still interested in staying with us, and we're still interested in retaining you as a mailgirl. We can offer you a full-fledged, salaried position after your time as a mailgirl has run its course. I'm not sure what, just yet, or what you might be qualified to do here at USF with your clothes on. Marketing, maybe? Communications? Maybe something in Human Capital with me?"<br>
<br>
He picked up the second envelope. "We do, as you'd expect, have you by the short and curlies." He glanced at her pussy. "Metaphorically speaking. We've got enough footage over the last few days that we can make it very, very difficult for you to return to your old job and your old life. Legal's working today, through a third party, to acquire the rights to your mortgage, your car loan, your husband's car loan, credit card debt. All above-board, I assure you. Should you decline to come on board, these will all come due immediately, with fairly onerous interest rates that will balloon up exponentially."<br>
<br>
Erin wanted to cry.<br>
<br>
"Yes, master," was all she offered in response.<br>
<br>
"Your marriage license will be rendered null and void," he went on. "Regardless of whether you stay with us or not. There's some legal maneuvering there that I'm not sure you'd understand. But we've got a good roster of in-house attorneys, as well as some of best outside law firms money can buy; Young & Unglaub, in particular, has made some pretty heady strides in the world of mailgirl contracts over the last few months.<br>
<br>
"In fact," he said, glancing at his watch, "I think you've been single now for about a half hour or so."<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," Ben had told her.<br>
<br>
"I'm not sure how your husband is going to take the news," Barrow continued. "But I think this grants you the freedom to perform your mailgirl duties unencumbered and unburdened by any sort of residual guilt."<br>
<br>
Erin said nothing. She wanted to scream. She wanted to wail. She wanted to cry for help. But, as Barrow had so eloquently put it, he had her by the "short and curlies." The same "short and curlies" that she'd left behind in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
"You look tense," Barrow observed, more sympathetic than malicious. Concerned, even. "This is what you wanted, isn't it? This is why you came?"<br>
<br>
She'd wanted to experience the life of a mailgirl. She'd wanted the whole "mailgirl experience." This was part of the fantasy. Captured. Enslaved. Toyed with and fucked over. Humiliated. Degraded. Owned.<br>
<br>
"Yes, master," she allowed. It wasn't Erin O'Neill speaking anymore. It was Visitor D. Number Whatever. A whore. A sexual plaything. A mailgirl.<br>
<br>
"I suspect I know what might help. What might ease a little of that tension." He jutted his chin towards the floor. "Why don't you give yourself a quick little finger fuck? Get it all out. You'll be able to think more clearly afterwards, and come to grips with all of this."<br>
<br>
He wanted her to masturbate on his office floor, to perform for him like the slut she was. And, God help her, she wanted it.<br>
<br>
She wanted it badly.<br>
<br>
She wanted it so badly.<br>
<br>
She wanted it so badly that she had no choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
"Yes, master," she mewed. She looked to the floor, and then nervously back in Barrow's direction. She wanted further direction.<br>
<br>
"You can do it on your back," he allowed, "if that's better for you."<br>
<br>
She nodded, and lowered herself to the floor. Barrow's office was carpeted with the same thin, scratchy carpet as Heidi Pomeranz's cubicle. She rolled onto her back, spread her legs open in the direction of her new master, and reached for her pussy. She was wet. Drenched. Hot and moist, ready to go. Her clit stood at attention, betraying her, and begging her to touch it.<br>
<br>
She gasped. Lightning shot through her body. Sexual energy overtook her. If Erin had any objections to what had just happened to her, the mailgirl inside of her had none.<br>
<br>
Still, she was tentative. This was uncharted territory for her - performing for an audience. She'd begun sneaking in the occasional session of self-pleasure in bed with Ben over the last couple of months, slipping under the covers after a night on Mailgirls Exposed and coming to bed horny as hell. He was a sound sleeper, and she'd been slow and careful not to wake him. But he'd never been awake when she'd diddled herself beside him. He'd never watched. Certainly, he'd never watched in the full light of day, in the middle of a downtown New York office building, while fluorescent lights beamed down upon her with their unforgiving light.<br>
<br>
"You're not the first girl who needed this," Barrow assured her, sensing the hesitation. "You're all built the same. It's there, just below the surface. That dirty slut. That bad girl. Desperate cunts, all of you. Just begging, begging for a master. Just needing the gentlest of pushes to let the whore out to play."<br>
<br>
The hesitation was gone. Erin began rubbing now, faster and faster, with more force and increasing abandon. "Jesus," she sighed. "Jesus..."<br>
<br>
"In fact," he said, standing and rounding the desk, "Beg me. Beg me to help."<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," Ben had told her.<br>
<br>
"Please," Erin conceded softly. "Please, master. Please help me."<br>
<br>
Ben was a continent away. Ben was no longer her husband. She was no longer anyone's wife. To hear Barrow tell it, she'd been single now for the last thirty minutes. She was free. She was free in way she'd never known, to let the whore out to play, to be the mailgirl she was so desperate to be. She wanted Barrow on top of her, inside of her, and fucking her until she exploded around his cock. She wanted the analysts down the hall, two at a time, covering her with their cum. She wanted Barrow's secretary - sweaty, hungry, and naked - with her tongue probing Erin's insides. She wanted "Captain Buttplug" with his toys. She wanted the vicious bitch with her binder clips. She wanted Sarah Scott. And Sophie Scott. And their strap-on. She wanted her sisters - her stepsisters - jack-hammering away at her from either end with their toys.<br>
<br>
"Please," she begged again. The desperation was real, and evident in her tone. "Please, master. Please, please, please..."<br>
<br>
Barrow would do as she asked, but he wasn't ready to release his hold on the reins. "Up. Off the floor, slut." He undid his belt, and Erin heard his fly descend. As she got to her feet, she fixated on his crotch, wanting to see him pull his cock from his pants.<br>
<br>
She'd be disappointed. He'd give her no show. His dick was meant to be felt, not seen. She was the naked slut. She was the one who was exposed. She was one who was bent over the desk, told to grasp the far side, and run through.<br>
<br>
Handcuffs emerged. Erin wasn't sure where they'd come from, or when Barrow had produced them. In the fog of overwhelming and all-consuming lust, she'd been cuffed to the far side of his desk. She was bent over, on her toes, with her ass in the air. When he entered - sliding forcefully inside of her without a hint of resistance - she shrieked in pleasure. She was cumming already.<br>
<br>
Barrow was big. Bigger than Ben, certainly. Bigger than any one of those dirty one-night stands in Tempe. He clutched her ass, squeezing it, and held the squirming mailgirl in place as he began to stroke in and out of her, back and forth, deeper and deeper. She'd orgasmed once already, but she could feel another building.<br>
<br>
Barrow, for his part, wasn't in this for her. He was "helping her," sure. He was giving her what she wanted and needed and craved. But she was an object to him - nothing more than warm and welcoming pussy spread up against his desk.<br>
<br>
That thought alone sent her cresting towards another climax. Her cunt spasmed and squeezed, gripping him with all its might, desperately trying to hold on to him as he slid back and forth, in and out. She wanted to milk him for all he was worth. She wanted receive everything he had to offer. She wanted him to cum inside of her. She wanted to be his fuck toy.<br>
<br>
"Jesus!" she called out again. Barrow's secretary was now a participant, whether she liked it or not, playing audience to Erin's increasingly loud vocalizations from the far side of the office door. "Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!"<br>
<br>
"Jesus Christ!" Catherine Ryan yipped from beside her. "Jesus Christ!"<br>
<br>
It may have been His birthday, but Erin doubted that Our Lord and Savior had anything to do with the orgasm Erin's stepmother was having in the shower beside her.<br>
<br>
Erin's legs went to jelly, and it was all she could do to keep from collapsing beneath the cold water of the shower. She steadied herself against the mirror in front of her, and came back down. Her mind was swimming. The world around her was nothing more than background noise. The desperate eyes of her own reflection stared back at her.<br>
<br>
"Jesus Christ!" Catherine Ryan called out once more, with a finality that signaled she, too, had cum. She, too, had gotten herself off in the mailgirls locker room at Park Place.<br>
<br>
Barrow's office faded away, and the fantasy dissipated with it. It was still Christmas Day. She was still at Park Place. She was still nothing more than a visitor to this world.<br>
<br>
Shame overtook her immediately. She was painfully aware that a locker room full of mailgirls had just witnessed her finger-fuck herself in the shower, that she'd cum at least twice, that she'd gotten herself off beside her father's second wife. Her sisters - her stepsisters - were undoubtedly somewhere nearby. Hidden cameras were rolling everywhere. Will Barrow would be watching.<br>
<br>
Catherine, in the reflection, offered Erin a sheepish look. Thankfully, she said not a word. But her expression read that same complex cocktail of embarrassment and relief, and she met Erin with a look that seemed to be trying to play it all off as a joke. Like, "What are you going to do? Right?" A girl's got needs, after all.<br>
<br>
The older woman had been in the shower before Erin had joined her, one showerhead over. And, though she hadn't been at work upon herself when Erin stepped under the cold water, it had been Catherine who'd made the first move. Erin had - initially at least - pretended it wasn't happening when her stepmother began to sigh beside her. Catherine was in her bubble, and Erin was in her own. Though they'd been separated only by inches, there'd been an imaginary divide that had gone up between them.<br>
<br>
Only, that imaginary divide wasn't soundproof. When Catherine had begun to touch herself, Erin was well aware what was happening. The brunette had been abuzz with sexual energy, sure, but she'd been abuzz with sexual energy since before she'd even arrived at Park Place. Her nipples had been erect for so long that it was bordering on painful. Her pussy had been so wet that she'd begun wondering when it might begin to drip down the inside of her thighs. But Erin hadn't entered the shower with the intention of masturbating alongside her stepmother - only to take a quick rinse, cool down, and get clean. The dirtiness, though, of her father's wife touching herself had overtaken her, and the dirty slut hiding just below the surface had only needed that gentlest of pushes to come out.<br>
<br>
The Will Barrow of her fantasy had been right.<br>
<br>
Erin had been lost in that fantasy while living in this one. She'd wanted the mailgirl experience, and she was experiencing it full-on with full fanfare. In that moment, she understood how Sarah and Sophie could have happened, and how Mailgirl Number Five could have gone down on her own sister. The naughtiness of it all. The dirty, wanton slut who'd just gotten off next her stepmother had gotten off on the dirty, naughty, sluttiness of it all.<br>
<br>
Whatever tomorrow held, whatever Mistress Rei and Will Barrow had in store for her, Erin O'Neill was a mailgirl through and through.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
"Christmas dinner," as it turned out, was mailgirl chow. And small group of the mailgirls had been responsible for pulling together a serviceable meal for the male guests that morning. But even the four girls receiving said male guests were to eat their allotted chow; the only difference from the rest of them was that they were given individual dog bowls, fetched from some supply closet, and instructed to place them on the floor at the feet of their male callers.<br>
<br>
There was no Christmas goose or honey-baked ham for any of them, no turkey or sides. Last night's spread had been Mistress Rei's one allowance for the girls' Christmas break, and a good number of the girls lamented not having stuffed themselves further with real food before returning to the thick, disgusting grey gruel. Erin forced herself to eat, gobbling down a more than healthy serving; she was already tipsy from her coffee-with-cream that morning, and still a little hung over from the night before. She stuffed her face with her stepmother and stepsisters, and managed to find humor in the absurdity of this particular Christmas family get-together.<br>
<br>
Phones would be made available up in the executive secretarial pool on the 6th Floor within a limited window that afternoon, and Erin did want to talk to Ben. She did and she didn't. She needed to, however. Patrick would be out of range, and wouldn't be hurt if he didn't hear from his wife or his daughter or his stepdaughters until some other point. Catherine, Sarah, and Sophie, as well as Plaza Seven, agreed to accompany Erin up the 6th Floor all the same, to wait for her to speak with her loving husband. After that, they'd head out into the building, unsure of what, exactly, they'd do with their spare time that afternoon. Erin admitted she wanted a nap. Catherine agreed. Sophie thought she knew a good spot. The fact that Sarah grabbed the strap-on, and carried it in one hand, told Erin that a "nap" wasn't all that she had in mind with her friends.<br>
<br>
But before departing for the 6th Floor, Catherine insisted that she needed to meet Angela Giannini's husband. There was a morbid curiosity there, she admitted. But she'd also promised Visitor F she would. If Erin and the girls wanted to wait for her in the service corridor, while she strutted naked into the cafeteria - that was fine.<br>
<br>
Erin had no interest in meeting Mailgirl Fourteen's father, of exposing herself in all her glory to him and the small handful of other men who'd come to visit their loved ones. Hiding in the service corridor, or even waiting in the locker room, was by far the preferable option. She knew she was being ridiculous, though; Mr. Giannini and the others could see right through the mirror glass on the other side. They'd likely witnessed Erin's little show with her stepmother. And so she, and the others, dutifully followed behind Catherine.<br>
<br>
Erin wasn't sure what the relationship between Nineteen and her ex-boyfriend was - if it was a good one, if it was a bad one, if they'd only broken up a few weeks earlier when she'd become a mailgirl. She couldn't exactly read the look on Nineteen's face, as the girl had her backside to her, and she had said face in her dog-dish at her former beau's feet. The ex himself was good-looking but non-descript, early thirties and clean-cut. He seemed to be amused with Nineteen's new station in life, and enjoyed his lunch while leering at the other girls.<br>
<br>
Thirteen's father, a Chinese gentleman in his fifties or sixties, was clearly having a harder time of it. He spoke in either Mandarin or Cantonese - Erin wasn't sure which - in a calm, soothing tone. He was reassuring Thirteen of something or another, but had an absent look upon his face. He wanted to be anywhere else, doing anything else. But he was here for her, all the same.<br>
<br>
Four, meanwhile, had finished her meal, and was now standing in a mailgirl's standard "Feet" position before her brother. He was joking with her, talking with her, catching up with her. Erin caught a "mom" here or there. A "dad." He didn't let his eyes wander, and the exchange felt that much more awkward for it.<br>
<br>
By contrast, whatever freak show was playing out with the Gianninis was almost preferable. Mother and daughter, naked together, were licking their bowls clean at the feet of Mr. Giannini, while Mr. Giannini himself was watching without any sense of shame or embarrassment. They were naked. He was clothed. They were being treated like animals. But he carried on a one-sided conversation in his wife's direction while she ate - a conversation punctuated with words like "hot" and "sexy." His eyes wandered to the other girls in the cafeteria, and through the mirror glass into the locker room beyond. As Catherine and her group approached, he greeted them with a big, predatory smile, and made no attempt to pretend he wasn't drinking them in.<br>
<br>
"Well, hello," he offered in Catherine's direction. "I hear you had quite the evening with my wife?"<br>
<br>
Catherine was caught off-guard. To her credit, she recovered. "She's got a mouth on her."<br>
<br>
Angela, grey goop smattered all over her face, looked up and smiled at the double entendre.<br>
<br>
Mr. Giannini laughed, re-evaluated Visitor E, and then corrected her. "'She's got a mouth on her, sir.'"<br>
<br>
"Forgive this dumb slut," Catherine replied mockingly. "She forgot her place. Sir."<br>
<br>
"Happens to the best of you," he said, chuckling to himself. "And, my, aren't you the best of you."<br>
<br>
Erin blushed on her stepmother's behalf.<br>
<br>
"And 'Mr. Giannini' will be fine," he allowed.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Mr. Giannini," Catherine answered.<br>
<br>
In a normal setting, Catherine might have shaken his hand. Angela might have made introductions. They might have wished each other a "Merry Christmas," had a good laugh, and been on their way. Instead, Mr. Giannini gestured to the floor, and invited Catherine to join his wife for a quick bite.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Mr. Giannini," Catherine said. Playing her part, she tried to excuse herself. "This girl has already eaten."<br>
<br>
"I saw," he said. "In fact, I got to see quite a bit." He looked to Erin, who immediately turned her gaze to the floor. "Another sister?"<br>
<br>
"Stepsister," Erin corrected him. "Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
Back to Catherine, the man clucked his tongue and smiled. "Naughty girl."<br>
<br>
Neither Catherine nor Erin had acknowledged what had transpired beneath the showers. Angela's husband seemed to take pleasure in bringing it up.<br>
<br>
Catherine said nothing.<br>
<br>
"Eat," he ordered. "Mistress Rei won't mind. You made a meal of my wife. How about a quick meal with my wife?"<br>
<br>
Catherine looked to Sarah for help. Sarah's only response was to explain, "Mr. Giannini is a Managing Director in Mergers and Acquisitions." That was to say, Mr. Giannini was a USF employee who was used to getting his way with the mailgirls.<br>
<br>
What his daughter was doing here among their ranks, then, seemed to be a story unto itself.<br>
<br>
"I'm almost finished," Angela offered from her bowl on the floor, coming to Catherine's rescue in her own way. "Help me with the last little bit."<br>
<br>
Catherine scowled, but got on all fours all the same, and took up position to one side of Angela Giannini. She and Angela took turns with the bowl, while the older man took stock of the other naked mailgirls in front of him.<br>
<br>
"Seven," he greeted Plaza Seven. "A pleasure to see you here today."<br>
<br>
"My pleasure, Mr. Giannini," Plaza Seven cooed politely.<br>
<br>
"I'll make sure to spend a few chits on you later this week. We have a group coming over from the FTC, and I want to make sure we put on a good show."<br>
<br>
"Of course, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
"Stretch beforehand," he instructed her. "They'll put you through a workout." In Sarah's direction, he shrugged, and explained himself. "Jumping jacks. I don't know what it is about jumping jacks."<br>
<br>
"I remember, Mr. Giannini," Sarah said in response.<br>
<br>
Jumping jacks, from what Erin could discern from her research, seemed to be a common and recurring fetish among mailgirl enthusiasts.<br>
<br>
"Of course, of course," Mr. Giannini remembered, reminiscing over some shared experience he and Sarah had presumably had the previous summer, when she was at the Plaza. "I hope you two are treating my little girl with the respect that she deserves here at Park Place."<br>
<br>
Fourteen didn't glance up from her bowl. Sarah simply nodded, "Yes, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
He stared at Erin, taking her in, but spared her any commentary for the moment. Turning his attention back to Catherine, who was now licking Angela's bowl clean while Angela watched on, Mr. Giannini asked, "Just as your mother has been taking care of Mrs. Giannini...?"<br>
<br>
Angela met his eyes, and recited with a sly grin, "Sir, per Human Capital, I am to be called by my mail room visitor's designation."<br>
<br>
"'Mrs. F,' then?" He smiled. "I do thank you for expanding her palette." He tilted his head in the direction of Mailgirl Thirteen. "I was afraid she was becoming a bit of a 'rice queen.'"<br>
<br>
Catherine hesitated, unsure of how to respond. After a beat, and a gulp, she said finally, "It was my pleasure, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure it was," he nodded, and lost himself for a moment inside his own imagination.<br>
<br>
When he returned to them, Mr. Giannini came back to Erin. He eyed her up and down. He lingered on her thighs, her hips, and her stomach. He shot her a wolfish, appreciative smile.<br>
<br>
"You," he said to her, "turn around for me. Let me get a better look."<br>
<br>
It was Erin's turn now to glance at Sarah and Sophie for support. Though they said nothing aloud, both of them met her look, and warned her to play along. Or there'd be consequences for them all.<br>
<br>
Erin did as instructed. She didn't want to feel the sting of Mistress Rei's bullwhip in earnest. She turned slowly, as she expected he'd want her to. When she was facing the opposite direction, with her back to Mr. Giannini, she came to a stop, and let him get a better view of her backside.<br>
<br>
He chuckled behind her. "You stupid sluts," he laughed. There was no anger in the tone, only amusement. "It's like you've all had a fucking lobotomy, and can't follow a simple instruction. Turn all the way around. Back to me."<br>
<br>
How was Erin to know that was what he had meant?! Rage boiled up inside of her over the insult, so casual and off-the-cuff. She turned all the way back around, until she was facing her tormentor, and met herself with another emotion entirely: shame. She felt bad that she hadn't anticipated what he'd actually meant. She felt dumb. She wanted to please him.<br>
<br>
"This girl is sorry for being so stupid," Erin apologized, the words forming on their own and escaping her mouth without any higher brain function. Maybe there was a kernel of truth in Mr. Giannini's derision.<br>
<br>
"It's okay, sweetheart," he reassured her. "You're new at this."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
He lingered upon her front side once more, again dropping his eyes to her crotch. As he spoke, it was as if he was addressing her pussy more than Erin herself. Which seemed appropriate, perhaps.<br>
<br>
"So you're a mailgirl tourist?"<br>
<br>
"A visitor, Mr. Giannini. I'm visiting...that is...this girl is visiting her step-sisters."<br>
<br>
"Maybe," he clucked. "You're putting yourself through an awful lot for your stepsisters."<br>
<br>
Erin said nothing. She was naked before him in more ways than one.<br>
<br>
"What do you do for work? In the real world?"<br>
<br>
"I...this girl teaches English. Eleventh grade. Mostly."<br>
<br>
"A schoolmarm!" Mr. Giannini teased. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone, and snapped a picture. "I bet your students would get a kick out of this."<br>
<br>
It wasn't as if Fourteen's father had the mailing list for her school. And posting a photo of her somewhere online didn't seem like the behavior of a high-level corporate executive; she doubted that Mr. Giannini was pathetically trolling around on Mailgirls Exposed. He was saying this to get a rise out of her, a reaction.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure they don't know about your little fishes..."<br>
<br>
Her tattoo. "No, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
He let out a low whistle. "I wish I'd had teachers like you when I was growing up." He paused, thought this over for a moment, and added, "Though, probably for the best. It might have been difficult to concentrate on Shakespeare or Gatsby with all of that parading around in front of the class."<br>
<br>
Her college-track classes had just finished a unit on the Scarlet Letter.<br>
<br>
"Come here," he instructed her. "Let's have a closer look."<br>
<br>
"Look-but-don't-touch" was USF's standard policy. But, as Erin understood it, upper management types like Mr. Giannini often violated that policy - to a point - without much consequence. As she stepped forward, the older man did, indeed, take advantage of that executive privilege, and ran his middle finger ever-so-delicately over her tattoo. He traced the outline of the little red fish just so.<br>
<br>
"Smooth," he offered as a compliment.<br>
<br>
She wanted him to go bolder. She wanted him to run his finger all the way down her hip and between her thighs. Her legs were parted. Her pussy was warm and welcoming. She wanted him to go for it, to touch it, to penetrate it.<br>
<br>
She shivered at his touch, and he felt the tremor. He looked up her, then back down to her midsection, and pulled away. "Smooth all over, in fact," he said.<br>
<br>
Erin exhaled. She hadn't been aware that she'd been holding her breath.<br>
<br>
"Let's get you up on the table," Mr. Giannini said. As he leaned back in his chair, he tapped the counter top. "Get you in position, and really see what we have here."<br>
<br>
He turned to his daughter, and with disdain in his voice, asked, "I mean, that's what this is really about, right? You girls get off on teasing us all, showing off what good little cum receptacles you'd all be if you had your way."<br>
<br>
Fourteen, through gritted teeth, responded only, "Yes, Mr. Giannini."<br>
<br>
"...if only Human Capital didn't protect you from yourselves."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mr. Giannini," Fourteen repeated.<br>
<br>
To Erin, he patted the table once more. "Up. Up. All fours."<br>
<br>
Erin didn't look to Sarah or Sophie this time. They were witnessing this submission, right alongside Catherine, Angela, and Fourteen. She couldn't bear to acknowledge their presence.<br>
<br>
Erin wondered to herself whether Mistress Rei might see what was happening and put a stop to it. After all, mailgirls weren't allowed on furniture, were they? Mr. Giannini no doubt knew this, but he also no doubt knew of a few loopholes. The letter of the law was clear, but the spirit of the law was likely more about keeping Erin from rubbing her wet pussy or bare asshole upon surfaces non-mailgirls might sit. As she got up onto her hands and knees, and crawled down the length of the table, she felt that much more exposed, those very same pussy and asshole on display for anyone and everyone behind her.<br>
<br>
Mr. Giannini stood, rounded the table, and got himself a better look. He didn't touch, but she could feel his breath upon her backside.<br>
<br>
"Knees a little further apart," he told her. "Forehead down."<br>
<br>
Erin parted her legs, and a waft of her own pussy met her nose. It was definitely hers. There was no doubt that others could smell it, too.<br>
<br>
She placed her forehead flat on the surface of the table and closed her eyes. She was "presenting." She was "in position." "Forehead," was the term Mistress Rei had used yesterday afternoon. She was ready and willing to accept whatever happened next.<br>
<br>
She half-expected a finger to come, though she knew it was a well-established no-no. She wanted a finger to come. The power that Mr. Giannini held over her was intoxicating. And, just like in her fantasy beneath the shower, she would have done anything he'd told her to. Sarah, Sophie, and the others would see her get penetrated by Fourteen's father. They'd hear her sighs. They'd watch her cum.<br>
<br>
But that finger never came. Instead, Mr. Giannini circled the table with menace, assessing the naked submissive in total. She was a prized pig at the country fair. She was an animal, to be bought and sold.<br>
<br>
"Up," he ordered. "Back up on all fours."<br>
<br>
"'Hands-and-Knees,'" Angela offered helpfully.<br>
<br>
"Hands-and-Knees," Mr. Giannini repeated. "Let's get a better look at those tits."<br>
<br>
Erin grimaced. She returned to her hands and knees, as instructed, and opened her eyes. She stared down at the table, beaten and dominated, and said nothing.<br>
<br>
"In fact, let's get a better feel," he said. "Mrs. F, would you care to do the honors?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mr. Giannini." Erin could hear the woman's smile.<br>
<br>
Angela and Catherine had finished their shared meal, apparently, and licked their bowl clean. They'd no doubt then cleaned each other's faces with their tongues - a show Erin had missed as Mr. Giannini had her jump through hoops of her own. Angela stood, stepped forward, and cupped Erin's dangling right breast her hand. With the knuckle of her thumb, she found Erin's nipple, and kneaded it as she did so.<br>
<br>
"Ho..." Erin breathed, the sound escaping from between her lips, and signaling to her audience just how much this was affecting her.<br>
<br>
"Careful," Mr. Giannini chided his wife. "We can't have this little cupcake cumming outside of the locker room."<br>
<br>
"We have free run this afternoon, Mr. Giannini," Angela corrected him. Erin could cum in just about every room in the building, if she wanted to.<br>
<br>
"Of course, of course," he replied. "Still. I think that's enough."<br>
<br>
It wasn't the hand Erin had been hoping for, and it wasn't the body part she'd been hoping for. But Angela's touch had been welcome all the same, and she reacted to its removal with no small amount of disappointment.<br>
<br>
"Well, maybe just a little taste," Mr. Giannini said, sending Erin's imagination into overdrive. "Though maybe let's have one of the sisters show our tourist here how much they appreciate the visit. Number Two?"<br>
<br>
Erin was frozen in place. He couldn't actually order Sarah to go down on her, could he? That seemed like it was crossing a line, and Erin searched her internal databanks for something like that in the literature. She wasn't sure. She couldn't remember whether such a thing was allowed or not. What had Sophie said about what she and Sarah had been forced to do? Erin wasn't thinking clearly.<br>
<br>
It had to have been against USF's strict mailgirl policies. Mr. Giannini once again demonstrated a deft understanding of what he could or could not get away with. Mouth-to-pussy was likely off the figurative table.<br>
<br>
Mouth-to-ass, however?<br>
<br>
"Kiss it," Mr. Giannini told Sarah. And, before Erin could even think of protesting, Sarah had used her left hand to push Erin's left buttock out of the way and planted a quick kiss directly on Erin's asshole.<br>
<br>
Erin felt herself pucker up.<br>
<br>
"No, no," Fourteen's father said sternly. "Really get in there. Get a taste. Show your sister how grateful you are."<br>
<br>
Stepsister, Erin corrected him internally. The distinction seemed more important than ever in that moment.<br>
<br>
The sensation was more weird than sexual, and Erin fought the urge to squirm. Before yesterday, with Mistress Rei and her exploratory little circles with her fingers, no one had ever come close to touching her there, in such a dirty, forbidden place. None of her former lovers. Not Ben. She might have - might have! - tried anal if Ben had really wanted it, if he'd asked. But it had never come up. Ben wasn't that guy. Ben was far too vanilla in his sexual desires to even think of asking.<br>
<br>
Sarah's mouth was warm and wet. She teased Erin's ass with her tongue, but it was more a tickle than a probe, and done entirely for show. For Mr. Giannini. Sarah offered no pushback, no fight. She did as she was told, without hesitation. She was a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
It wasn't sexual, no. But it was. It was intimate and down-right filthy, and Erin wouldn't have protested if Sarah went a little further, with a little more force. It was the domination that was sexy and sexual. It was her submission that had her that wet again, so soon after her last act of semi-incestful behavior with Catherine in the locker room. She was relieved when Mr. Giannini took Sarah by the hair and pulled her away. But she also felt her body push backwards, chasing the sensation and wanting more.<br>
<br>
Mr. Giannini still had Sarah by the hair, and he pressed her face - with no small amount of pressure - against Erin's bare rump. "Now give her a bite. Really bear down. I want to see teeth."<br>
<br>
Again, Erin's step-sister did as instructed, without question or without hesitation. And Erin accepted what was being done to her without any protest of her own - save for an uncontrollable yelp of "Ow ow ow!" in pain, as Sarah sunk her teeth into Erin's backside. Pain and pleasure were all mixed up inside the naked brunette.<br>
<br>
"Good girl," Mr. Giannini cooed. "Good girl."<br>
<br>
When allowed, Sarah did, finally and thankfully, release Erin's buttock with her teeth. Erin wouldn't have been surprised if she'd drawn blood. But Mr. Giannini just laughed, traced the imprint of Sarah's teeth on Erin's skin with one finger, and released the blonde.<br>
<br>
"All right," he said, stepping back and slapping her on the ass, "I think that's probably enough for now. Why don't you and your sisters run along, and let me spend some quality time with my family."<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
"What a fucking creep!!" Erin shrieked, as their little group returned to the service corridor. She felt a shiver shoot up her spine.<br>
<br>
"They're all creeps," Sarah answered.<br>
<br>
"Even the nice ones," Plaza Seven added. "At least with a guy like that, they're not pretending not to be."<br>
<br>
Erin could still feel her stepsister's slobber all over her asshole - a sensation Erin wasn't sure she had the words for. She wanted to wipe herself clean, but certainly didn't want to touch herself down there with her bare hand. She realized the ridiculousness of that hesitation, however, when she met eyes with Sarah.<br>
<br>
Sarah read her thoughts. "I think I probably got the worst end of that."<br>
<br>
"Maybe," Erin laughed. She couldn't help but laugh.<br>
<br>
"I think I want to rinse my mouth out before we go upstairs."<br>
<br>
"Maybe brush your teeth, too?" Plaza Seven teased.<br>
<br>
Erin relented, reached between her legs, and wiped herself with her hand. She then wiped her hand on the inside of her thigh.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry," Catherine apologized. "I didn't know..."<br>
<br>
"Not your fault," Sarah assured her. "This is what this is."<br>
<br>
Sophie opened the door to the locker room, and held it for the group. Erin needed to wash her hands. Sarah needed to wash her face.<br>
<br>
Erin shook her head. "And what's with Fourteen? His daughter?!!"<br>
<br>
"She was an honest-to-god volunteer," Sarah explained, in a more hushed tone, so that the other mailgirls in the locker room wouldn't hear. "She did it just to fuck with him. Only he and his wife get off on it all. Angela's here constantly, and he slurps it all up."<br>
<br>
"Maybe next time warn me?" Catherine chided her daughters. "Before I get caught up in the family drama?"<br>
<br>
"Had we known that's what you were going to do..." Sophie began, but trailed off.<br>
<br>
"Besides," Sarah laughed, "we're tits-deep in family drama already."<br>
<br>

<br>
The executive secretarial pool, up on the 6th Floor, was an open-concept layout with no cubicles. Desks were arranged in neat rows, in a throwback to some earlier age. The top executive assistants had specific spots outside of their respective executives' doors, but the pool was home to more junior assistants - spillover for travel arrangements and typing up memos and meeting notes. Erin would have no privacy as she talked to Ben, but she chastised herself for ever even getting hopes up that privacy would be a thing.<br>
<br>
Sarah and Plaza Seven disappeared off into the building together after getting Erin set up at one of the desks near the front of the cavernous room, Sarah clutching the belt of the strap-on and doing her best to avoid eye contact with Catherine. Sophie volunteered to stay and wait with Erin, as Erin would need the mailgirl's smartphone to unlock doors and meet up with Sarah later. Catherine, too, stayed behind, though she and Sophie announced they'd wait out at the reception desk around the corner and down the hall. They'd use the time to catch up, one-on-one.<br>
<br>
Erin wasn't alone, however. Mailgirl Fifteen smiled and gave a little wave when the group had arrived, but she was engaged in a round of Christmas calls of her own a few desks back. Mailgirl Number Eight, an African-American girl with short hair and an athlete's build, was in the far corner, but didn't look up; she looked cowed and miserable. In contrast, Mailgirl Seven, along with Visitor C, were passing a phone back-and-forth between one another and babbling in French to someone on the far end of the line, giggling all the while.<br>
<br>
Sarah and Sophie had warned Erin to keep it light with Ben, as all of the mailgirls' outgoing calls were recorded. This was an effort to monitor them and what they said to their loved ones and other outsiders, but also to use against them if the need arose. The Park Place girls had found this out the hard way, when Mailgirl Four's desperate calls to her family were played back for her after that first week; her ass had been paddled so much that...<br>
<br>
"You would even say it glowed," Sophie had sung. The others groaned.<br>
<br>
When Ben picked up, the full weight of everything that had transpired over the last twenty-four hours hit her hard. She'd thought about him here or there, and he'd come up in conversation a handful of times. But she'd been doing her best to keep Ben O'Neill at arm's length a world away. Erin O'Neill was married; for Visitor D, it was a little more complicated.<br>
<br>
Undressing in the lobby. Watching Catherine and Sarah get spanked. Masturbating with Sophie. Seeing Sarah get eaten out. Masturbating with Catherine. The vibrators and dildos and buttplugs from that morning, which were being put to good use by the recipients throughout the building that afternoon. The run-in with Mr. Giannini.<br>
<br>
She regretted calling him almost immediately. Her real life was intruding upon this fantasy, and the depths of depravity to which she'd sunk were on the line with her and her husband. But she owed him this. She owed him this, at least. A "Merry Christmas." A check-in. A hello.<br>
<br>
She stayed vague. Ben didn't really want to hear about the details anyways. She offered him broad strokes - being naked, sleeping on the floor, the weirdness of being around Catherine and her stepsisters without clothes - but stayed away from the more salacious bits. At every opportunity, she steered the conversation back to him and back to his family. How were his parents? His sister and her kids? What was the weather like that morning in Santa Barbara?<br>
<br>
The O'Neills were aware that Erin was visiting Sarah and Sophie in New Jersey, yes. And they were aware of the "situation" that Sarah and Sophie had both gotten themselves into. But, like Erin's father, they were in the dark about what such a visit entailed, and Ben wasn't going to fill them in any more than what Catherine had with Patrick. That the Scott sisters had become mailgirls was scandalous, to be sure, but the O'Neill Family wasn't exactly going to be discussing their plight over Christmas dinner.<br>
<br>
She wanted to tell him about the back-and-forth with Mistress Rei that morning, and to warn him that she might have created a situation for herself. That she might not be coming home. That this might not be such a brief visit after all. She'd been with Ben for so long that it felt dishonest not to share everything with him. He had even brought up that possibility, himself, but she evaded the question and brushed the idea off.<br>
<br>
"No blackmail, right?" Ben asked. "They're not adding you to the roster? I'm getting my wife back?"<br>
<br>
He was trying to make light of a very real possibility, and doing his best to sound as if he was just joking and teasing her. But, there was concern in his voice, as well.<br>
<br>
"No blackmail," Erin promised him. Given how quickly she'd given in to Mistress Rei that morning, blackmail hadn't even been needed.<br>
<br>
It was Christmas, after all; heavier things could wait.<br>
<br>
Her mind wandered. As Ben was catching her up on the goings-on in Santa Barbara, she wondered if she'd made up the piece in her masturbatory fantasy about USF's law firms finding a way to void marriage licenses. The idea seemed so fantastical that it couldn't actually have been real. Or could it have? All of this - the mailgirl concept at its very core - seemed the stuff of pure fantasy, stretching what could or couldn't happen in the real world. She thought she remembered reading about a mailgirl situation somewhere online, at a law firm, in which that very thing had occurred. If she really was to stay - whether that was here with USF or whether she'd be farmed out to one of their clients - it might be the kinder route to take, for Ben's sake. Anull the whole thing. Sign whatever divorce papers her new employer put in front of her.<br>
<br>
Free her, and see just how far she'd go.<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," Ben had assured her, when the subject of remaining a mailgirl had come up back at home.<br>
<br>
"I'd wait for you," he assured her now, coming back to it.<br>
<br>
"Ben..." she began, but trailed off. There was nothing really to say. She changed topics once more, and asked if he'd heard anything from her father.<br>
<br>
As they chatted back and forth, Erin found herself pulled back to the cafeteria. Mr. Giannini was a creep. An asshole. A sadist. He'd gone out of his way to humiliate her, specifically, and treat her as something so far beneath him that she'd felt like a piece of livestock.<br>
<br>
Why did that turn her on as much as it did?<br>
<br>
Submitting herself to his whims, to degrade and humiliate herself in front of an audience, to let things escalate and get out-of-hand with Sarah's tongue in her ass. She knew it was wrong, but she couldn't help it. She'd unlocked something, and set something free. Something that wasn't easily explained or tamped down.<br>
<br>
Ben would never be able to understand that. Ben would never be able to give her that. Even now, as he was asking her about the food, and chuckling over the ridiculous way she was instructed to speak to her "betters," there was empathy in his voice. He'd never be able to treat her with the disrespect and utter contempt that Mr. Giannini had. She'd never be just a sexual plaything, just a piece of meat, just a set of tits and ass.<br>
<br>
He'd never be able to get her off like Mr. Giannini could, and Mr. Giannini wouldn't even need to lay a finger on her to do so.<br>
<br>
As the scene in the cafeteria came back to her, Erin parted her legs a bit, and began to lightly run her finger over her bare pubic mound. She wasn't sure she liked how it felt, exactly. Typically, in the early stages of masturbation at home, she liked to run her fingers through her pubic hair - teasing herself just so. She'd always been meticulous about keeping her bikini region closely cropped and well-maintained, and this was by no means her first ever Brazilian wax. But she missed the ritual of starting off that way, even while conceding that her bare pussy and engorged lips just screamed sex.<br>
<br>
Her hand descended further south, exploring and touching without it necessarily having to lead to anything. She was leaning up against the left hand side of the desk, with her back to the rest of the secretarial pool and the other girls making holiday calls. She wasn't really playing with herself - not yet, at least - so much as she was just touching, feeling, caressing, without any agenda or intention. She was unencumbered by social norms, rules about what you do and don't do in public. Any one of the other girls might have witnessed her get herself off in the showers at lunch, just as she'd witnessed Number Eight get herself off when Erin had returned from the loading docks last night, just as she'd witnessed number Fifteen's masturbatory "race" against Plaza Seventeen at the Christmas Party.<br>
<br>
It didn't feel as much like cheating, with Ben on the other end of the line. But, more to the point, it didn't turn her on as much with just Ben on the other end of the line. She wanted him to be Mr. Giannini. She wanted him to be Will Barrow. She wanted him to be Mistress Rei.<br>
<br>
It was inevitable that Erin's exploratory session would become something more. She was kidding herself if she thought otherwise. Only an hour removed from her last indulgence in the locker room, Erin gave in. She found her clit, and began to rub more forcefully. She was slow and deliberate, so as to not call attention to herself. She breathed in and out calmly, so as to not tip off Ben what she was doing. If the others girls saw her, so be it. And if Ben noticed, and called her out on it - well, whatever. She'd roll with that, too. Worst case scenario? She could be honest about masturbating at Park Place when she got home, assuring him that it was at least during their call together.<br>
<br>
She'd promised Ben that she'd "be good." It was screwed up that, now, it was turning her on to "be bad."<br>
<br>
She imagined herself getting caught by Mistress Rei. That she was an actual mailgirl. That this was an actual workday. That the mailgirls behind her were the actual secretaries who manned these stations during office hours. And that she was in trouble.<br>
<br>
She hadn't been spanked yet. Was it messed up that she wished it had been her, and not Catherine, to join Sarah and the Plaza mailgirls as Sarah received her "correction" for accumulating too many demerits? In her fantasy, Mistress Rei administered the punishment right then and there, taking her over her lap and laying into her with her bare hand. How could she be such a whore as to touch herself outside of the locker room? How could she be such a slut that she couldn't help but succumb in the middle of the day, in the middle of a shift?<br>
<br>
"Call me when you get to the airport," Ben was telling her, a world away. "I gave Catherine something for you, for Christmas."<br>
<br>
"Mm-hmm," Erin replied. As Erin-the-mailgirl was spanked, she counted out each blow. As the number rose, both Erin-the-mailgirl and Erin-the-visitor began to crest.<br>
<br>
Ben went on. He loved her. He wanted to do everything for her. He hoped that this scratched whatever itch she had. That he'd wait for her if she needed more. Blah, blah, blah. Erin hit her orgasm, and it all faded to background noise. As she came, she had the presence of mind to hold the handset away from her mouth, and muffled her exhalations by placing the phone against her chest. It was a quick orgasm, and it was a controlled orgasm.<br>
<br>
Erin wasn't quite satiated; she wanted more, and she wanted more without holding back or pretending she wasn't doing what she was doing. Just one more frustration in Ben's direction.<br>
<br>
"Are you alright?" Ben asked. "I thought I lost you there for a second."<br>
<br>
Erin did her best to compose herself, catch her breath, and answer. "Sorry, I'm here. Just distracted. About everything. They record these calls."<br>
<br>
"They" record these calls. And "they" would know very well what their mailgirl visitor was doing during that call, even if her husband had no clue. Not only would she be required to report it, for Human Capital's meticulous record-keeping, but she assumed "they" were well-conditioned to hear what a mailgirl was known to do...<br>
<br>
"Okay," he said, after a pause. Erin suspected that he was playing back their conversation in his own head, wondering if he'd said anything embarrassing. And, likely mad at her for not telling him that at the start of their call.<br>
<br>
"I love you," she assured him. "I love you, I love you. And I miss you."<br>
<br>
She meant it. She did love him. She did miss him. She just wished that he could give this to her, himself. She wished it were Ben spanking her. She wished it were Ben stripping her down, and examining the in's and out's of her in the full light of day. She wished it were Ben controlling her, owning her, dominating her. She wished that he could give that to her.<br>
<br>
But that just wasn't Ben.<br>
<br>
"I love you, too," he told her. More hung in the air, and the silence was pregnant with things unsaid. "I'll see you tomorrow."<br>
<br>
Erin didn't repeat it back to him. Instead, she said only, "I love you," once more.<br>
<br>
When Erin turned back around, and placed the handset down on the receiver, Fifteen was smiling in her direction. Eight was still caught up in her own drama. Seven and Visitor C glanced over, giggled, and then chittered to themselves in French.<br>
<br>
She composed herself, took a deep breath, and set off for reception.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
So physically and emotionally exhausted as she'd been, Erin had dropped to sleep just moments after she laid down beside Sophie on the 5th Floor. And it was Sophie who'd had to wake her when it was time for dinner.<br>
<br>
Sophie had led Erin and Catherine to an out-of-the-way suite a good hike from the 6th Floor's executive offices, and Erin had been thankful for the distance; it felt as if she were putting Ben and their phone call as far away as possible. As Sophie let them in, through a locked door, the motion sensor lights clicked on, and lit their way to an office in the corner. Though Mistress Rei had expressly forbidden them from going into USF's offices, Sophie had interpreted the restriction to mean offices in use by actual USF employees. This office, with its thick, shag carpet, overstuffed couch, and unadorned walls, had belonged to Marvin Parnell, who'd retired in November. Erin now felt that it was now Sophie toeing the line about what was allowed and what wasn't, but she followed along all the same. At worst, she'd be punished by Mistress Rei - a scenario she'd literally just masturbated over.<br>
<br>
None of them was so bold as to collapse on the couch. But, they did liberate the couch's matching throw pillows, and bedded down on the floor. After last night - on the rock hard floor of the locker room - the soft carpet beneath Erin's body felt luxurious. Sophie dimmed the lights, too. Another luxury the girls weren't afforded in the locker room. The truth of it, however, was that Erin probably could have fallen asleep anywhere at that point.<br>
<br>
While Erin had slumbered, Sarah had joined her mother, her sister, and her stepsister in the office. She was there now, as Erin awoke. Plaza Seven hadn't joined her, but the unoccupied strap-on had, and lay by the door with its own stories to tell.<br>
<br>
There'd be no party in Human Resources again tonight, no second act for the Holiday-specific allowance of booze and treats. The girls would all go back to their normal routines tomorrow, though those normal routines would start with their usual nine o'clock bedtime tonight. Erin, for her part, was thankful for it; even after her afternoon nap, she wasn't sure she had it in her for another night of hard-partying, hard-drinking, and other associated activities. They'd still have free-run of the building until then, but the two Scott sisters' smartphones ticked down, minute by minute, to seven o'clock, when all of the mailgirls and their visitors were required to report to the locker room for dinner.<br>
<br>
Dinner was - once again - mailgirl chow, emptied from industrial-sized cans into the troughs at each end of the locker room. Erin got to her hands and knees alongside Catherine and Sophie, and gobbled down a significantly larger portion than she'd been able to stomach at prior meals. She was hungry. She'd worked up an appetite. And the chow itself had improved, at least in her own mind; it had gone from vile and revolting that first night to little worse than bland and inoffensive. As she ate, she was buoyed by the fact that - unlike the other girls - the visitors wouldn't have to make weight tomorrow morning.<br>
<br>
Sophie cleaned her off afterwards. And, she, Sophie. Up on her knees, she performed fellatio upon a water bottles affixed to the wall, and washed down her dinner. As she stood, and turned for the sinks, she was met by Mailgirl Number Fourteen.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry," Fourteen offered earnestly. "I'm sorry about before. With my father."<br>
<br>
"It's...it's alright," Erin replied.<br>
<br>
"He just picks on the other girls when I'm around. When I'm not around, too. He's one of the worst."<br>
<br>
From the stories that Erin had heard, she found that hard to believe. Not when the likes of Captain Buttplug and the Binder Clip Bitch were haunting Park Place.<br>
<br>
"It's okay," she assured the other girl. "I knew what this was."<br>
<br>
"Maybe," Fourteen said skeptically. "Still..."<br>
<br>
"It's okay," Erin repeated. "No worse for the wear." This wasn't entirely true; an inspection in the mirror had shown that Sarah's bite had left a pretty good black-and-blue.<br>
<br>
"He's such an asshole," the girl went on. She nodded towards her mother across the locker room, "And she's not much better."<br>
<br>
Erin nodded. "Yeah, the whole thing with her, with him - it just seems extra messed up."<br>
<br>
"He was one of the executives pushing for this," Fourteen explained. "Way back around this time last year. And I think she was in his ear. I don't know if their...weird...their weird thing was going on before. You know, behind closed doors."<br>
<br>
"It's not behind closed doors anymore."<br>
<br>
"It's not," she agreed. Fourteen looked around the room - to the mailgirls, the mailgirls from the Plaza, and the mailgirls' visitors. "When it got here, to Jersey, I thought maybe I could stop it. He got me my job here out of business school. And, in retrospect, I should have gone somewhere else. But the money was crazy. And the mailgirl money was crazier."<br>
<br>
"I've heard."<br>
<br>
"I thought - maybe, maybe - if I volunteered, it might sink in with him. What he was doing to these girls. But it just didn't sink in. If anything, I think he's worse."<br>
<br>
"Fourteen, it's okay. I mean, for me. I knew what this was. I knew what I was getting into. I had to see it for myself, and experience it for myself. Your father - without him, I don't know if I'd have got the full taste of it all."<br>
<br>
"I know, but..."<br>
<br>
"It's okay. It's not your fault. I'm messed up, myself. I wanted this. I think I want this."<br>
<br>
Fourteen looked a little relieved. "Okay. And...it's not uncommon. It's not uncommon to want this, once you're in it. It's just intense."<br>
<br>
"It is."<br>
<br>
"Like, I wanted to end this, when I was outside looking in. And I wanted no part of it, nothing to do with it, at the beginning. And now? I don't know. There's one part of me that wants Congress to shut it all down next month, with the Mailgirl Hearings and all, and I get free. But..."<br>
<br>
"But you're not sure anymore."<br>
<br>
Fourteen nodded.<br>
<br>
"You guys know about Lindsey Pickering, right?"<br>
<br>
Fourteen gave her a blank look.<br>
<br>
"The Congressgirl from Illinois? The one who got her dad's seat?"<br>
<br>
"Okay."<br>
<br>
"She and Grace Burgmeier were the ones really going after it. Them and the other Whitestocking groups." Burgmeier was a nationally-recognized attorney, with a history of taking on high-profile feminist cases. An absolute bulldog, she'd become one of the leading voices in opposition to the mailgirl concept in the US, and now represented a dozen or two dozen ex-mailgirls engaged in multiple suits from Seattle to San Francisco to New York. Including a few ex-mailgirls from USF.<br>
<br>
"Right, that I know. Did something happen?"<br>
<br>
"Well, the United American Women suit is blowing up. Turns out the girl they were championing was a plant. And some of the big firms here in New York, the ones with mailgirl programs of their own - Hobson Morgan McNamara, Young & Unglaub - got an audience with Pickering. And they worked her."<br>
<br>
"Worked her? What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not sure, exactly. But she's doing this, too. She's doing a week as a mailgirl at some big retailer in Chicago."<br>
<br>
"I didn't even know that Chicago had companies with mailgirls."<br>
<br>
"It might be the only one. For now. But the lawyers - and some of the Blackstocking people - got her to a place where she felt that the only way she'd have a full picture, and the only way she'd really understand, is to live it herself."<br>
<br>
"No fucking way..."<br>
<br>
"Yup," Erin said. "She's doing a week. Starting tomorrow, through the end of the year."<br>
<br>
"Jesus," Fourteen replied.<br>
<br>
"I'm just saying. She's going to come out of it either fired up to shut the whole thing down even more than she was before..."<br>
<br>
"...or she's going to get it," Fourteen finished. "She's going to get it, isn't she?"<br>
<br>
"I'm the wrong person to ask."<br>
<br>
By the sinks, Angela Giannini was engaged in a similar round of apologies to Catherine. From the look on Catherine's face, she wasn't having it.<br>
<br>
The locker room - so spotless and Spartan when Erin and Catherine had first arrived - was a mess. Littered about were sex toys and sex toy packaging. Some were being put to good use. Mailgirl Number Nine had a sleek, grape-colored vibrator buzzing against her pussy in the far corner, and Mailgirl Seventeen had been servicing Mailgirl Eighteen with another out in the service corridor when Erin had retuned for dinner. Other toys, though, were just scattered here, there, and everywhere - likely wet and sticky, and likely already low on batteries. Mistress Rei - still in her "Christmas-time dominatrix" outfit from that morning - would be collecting them from the girls shortly, and keeping them safe until the next Saturday night of relative freedom.<br>
<br>
As disgusting as this might have seemed to Erin twenty-four hours earlier, the toys had very quickly become communal property - no different than the toothbrushes and sticks of underarm deodorant. She wasn't going to touch the anal beads with a stick, but she was fascinated with the massive, ice-cream-cone-shaped "personal massager" that Number Ten had unwrapped that morning. Unwrapped, and then used at the sinks at lunchtime. Erin had never experimented with that sort of toy before, and she doubted - unless she were to become Mailgirl Number Twenty here at Park Place - she'd get another chance. Sure, she could buy one back in LA. But that wasn't going to happen, and she was here now...<br>
<br>
She picked it up, the weight surprising in her hands. There was a long electrical cord dangling from one end; this was the plug-in variety of sex toys. The only place in the locker room it could be used was, in fact, by the sinks, as the sinks were equipped with sockets for the girls' hair dryers.<br>
<br>
It was Sarah who caught her. And it was Sarah who called her out.<br>
<br>
"What do you got there?" Sarah teased in a sing-song voice.<br>
<br>
"Oh," Erin answered, startled. "Just looking."<br>
<br>
"Just looking?"<br>
<br>
Erin was embarrassed. But, hadn't she moved past embarrassment at that point? She shot Sarah a smile. "Okay, not just looking. It seems...more efficient."<br>
<br>
Sarah laughed, and threw up her hands defensively. "No judgment."<br>
<br>
"Do you think she'd mind?"<br>
<br>
"Who? Ten? We can ask. She had a pretty good ride with it earlier."<br>
<br>
Erin had seen. The girl's breasts, easily the largest in the locker room, had jiggled and bounced the entire time.<br>
<br>
"You don't have to do it here, though. I can find you somewhere a little more private? We still have a little time before bed."<br>
<br>
Erin nodded. At this point, any measure of self-control was gone. She'd already masturbated up on the 2nd Floor, down in the locker room, and up on the 6th. What was one more time? Any guilt over not "being good" was gone. She had bigger things to feel guilty for.<br>
<br>
"Alright. Let me just talk to Ten. And let my mom - Visitor E - and Mailgirl One and the Plaza girls know we're going to disappear for a bit."<br>
<br>
Erin nodded again dumbly. Sophie, last night. Sarah, now. Her stepsisters had now both helped her schedule masturbation sessions for herself.<br>
<br>
This was a weird Christmas with her family.<br>
<br>
Ten laughed when approached, and waved in Erin's direction. "Enjoy!" she sung out from where she was sitting against the mirror-glass with Four and Plaza Seventeen. "Just make sure you bring it back! Don't blow a fuse!"<br>
<br>
Catherine, meanwhile had somehow patched things up with Angela Giannini, and happily agreed to hang back, chatting with her new and once-again friend in the cafeteria. Erin wasn't sure what Angela had said to set things right, but perhaps it wasn't surprising that Catherine had forgiven Angela for her husband's behavior, given how easily Erin had forgiven Fourteen.<br>
<br>
Sophie, though, invited herself to tag along with Erin and Sarah. "Let's go to up to Monmouth on 6," she suggested, referring to a particular conference room by name. "There's a sweet view of downtown."<br>
<br>
Perhaps Sophie hadn't been informed of the purposes of this little expedition. Or perhaps she had, and just wanted it to make it nice for her stepsister.<br>
<br>
As Erin, Sarah, and Sophie departed the locker room, Erin immediately regretted the choice to bring the massager along with her. It was readily apparent what she was headed off to do, and she felt embarrassed for it. She wished Sarah or Sophie could have carried it for her, just to give her a bit more cover. Most mailgirls, as she understood it, typically broke down and masturbated after a few days on the job. Erin, by contrast, had turned into a monster and an addict overnight.<br>
<br>
They were in no real rush. It was at least another hour, hour-and-a-half, before bedtime, and Erin knew this wasn't going to take that long. But they ascended up six flights of stairs at a brisk pace all the same - force of habit for Mailgirls One and Two. Erin was out of breath when the reached the 6th Floor, but her stepsisters seemed hardly winded.<br>
<br>
The view was - as promised - amazing. The snowfall hadn't quite stopped, but it had lightened, and skyscrapers in downtown New York lit up the night through scattered flakes. Erin didn't know them all by name, but the Freedom Tower loomed large and was instantly recognizable. The whole of the panorama, taken in from a dim and quiet conference room on the far side of the Hudson, was magical. For a moment, it distracted Erin from the task at hand.<br>
<br>
Erin was still clutching the massager and its cord in her right hand when Sarah sidled up alongside her and took her left. It felt weird holding hands. Childish. But also intimate and reassuring, and so it was no surprise that the mailgirls fell into this practice when they were together. Fingers entangled, Sarah gave Erin's hand a little squeeze, and said more in that one small act than she could have ever said aloud.<br>
<br>
This was Sarah's world. This was life among the mailgirls. It was more than just naked girls running deliveries around the office. These girls - and now Erin could include herself among them, to a certain extent - were entirely exposed. Inside and out. There was no privacy, no hiding. And that included hiding from themselves.<br>
<br>
Why did they put up with it? Why didn't they just walk out? Why would anyone ever subject herself to this sort of humiliation, degradation, and torment? The name-calling? The control, right down to the pettiest of things? The infantilizing. The dehumanizing. The dog collars, the squat toilets, the trough.<br>
<br>
They did it because they liked it.<br>
<br>
They did it because they got off on it.<br>
<br>
They did it because there was nothing else like it.<br>
<br>
Though tempted and coerced into the role, a mailgirl discovered things about herself she might have otherwise run from her entire life. Erin had now experienced that self-discovery firsthand. And though she was terrified of the implications, she felt alive. She felt charged up. She felt excited for knowing the girl who'd been hiding inside her for so long.<br>
<br>
She leaned into Sarah, and planted a kiss upon her stepsister's lips.<br>
<br>
Sarah didn't recoil. She didn't pull away. She kissed Erin back.<br>
<br>
It was wrong and Erin knew it was wrong. It was wrong and Sarah knew it was wrong. It was wrong, but it was happening. There was no stopping it now.<br>
<br>
Sophie was there with them, in the room. But Sophie might have been a million miles away. Erin's whole world, at that moment, was this kiss. Sarah's lips were warm and soft. Her mouth was moist and welcoming. When their tongues met, the kiss enveloped Erin's entire body, and suddenly she was feeling it all the way up and down her spine, down to her toes and back up to between her legs. It wasn't so much a kiss as it was fireworks, shooting off in every direction inside of Erin, body and mind.<br>
<br>
Still holding the massager in her grip, Erin placed her hand on Sarah's right hip. They unlocked their fingers, and Erin's left hand found the blonde's other side, even as Sarah's fingertips began to brush up and down Erin's body. Erin felt the warmth of Sarah's body, and the electricity of skin upon naked skin. Erin, with a few inches on Sarah, now leaned in closer and more forcefully, and devoured her.<br>
<br>
It all happened so quickly after that.<br>
<br>
"Are you sure?" Sarah asked, when Erin had momentarily let her come up for air.<br>
<br>
Erin nodded, and begged pathetically, "Please."<br>
<br>
Sarah's hands were on Erin's breasts, playing with her nipples. Erin's fingers were running through Sarah's hair. And then, from behind her, Erin felt nails scratching down the length of her back, as Sophie announced her presence.<br>
<br>
What was about to happen with Sarah was dirty and wrong. The addition of Sophie, too, put I over the top.<br>
<br>
Erin wasn't kissing Sarah anymore. Now it was Sophie's turn. Erin had seven years on her stepsister, but Sophie was more experienced by far. She pushed Erin against the big, picture-glass window, with the New York City skyline behind her, and pinned her down with her body. She took Erin's jaw in the palm of her hand, wrapped her fingers around the back of the brunette's head, and kissed her deeply. Sophie's body was pressed against Erin's, just off to one side, and Erin could feel the younger girl grind her pelvis into the top of Erin's thigh.<br>
<br>
Sarah, meanwhile, had begun descending down Erin's body with her lips. Her neck. Her chest. Her nipples - where Sarah lingered. Her belly button. That bare patch of skin where her pubic hair had been. And then, with no more teasing or foreplay, Erin's sex was in her stepsister's mouth.<br>
<br>
Erin whined, went weak in the knees, and submitted. She had the presence of mind to drop the massager slowly to the floor, letting it down by the cord, and then used her right hand to collect a huge fistful of Sarah's hair. Sarah was less a real person in that moment than she was just another sex toy, and Erin used her as such. She pulled Sarah into her, and drove her pussy further into her mouth, feeling the full pressure of her lips, her jaw, her head.<br>
<br>
"Oh," she sighed. "Ohhhh..."<br>
<br>
By this point, Sophie's lips were on Erin's neck, kissing and licking and sucking, and Erin was free to vocalize what was happening to her.<br>
<br>
"Ohhhh...," she sighed again. "Ohhhh..."<br>
<br>
Even as she continued to knead Erin's breasts with her left hand, Sophie used her right to take hold of the brunette's shoulders. She forced her in the direction of the floor, and Erin slid down the window pane. Sarah moved with her - backing away, but never being allowed to remove her mouth from between Erin's legs. As they approached the floor, Sophie slipped behind her stepsister. While continuing to kiss Erin's neck, she cradled her body between her legs, and came to sitting position behind Erin on the carpet. Erin, too, was now seated, with Sophie's body pressed up against her back, Sophie's mouth still on her neck, Sophie's fingertips still teasing her nipples, and Sarah still between her thighs.<br>
<br>
Erin squirmed as Sarah lapped away at her clit. She reached up behind her, and ran her hands through Sophie's hair. She bucked up, bare ass off the thin, scratchy carpet, and followed Sarah's lips and tongue wherever they took her. And then, just as Erin felt her body was beginning to lose control and run away from her, Sarah pulled away.<br>
<br>
A finger entered the brunette. A thumb found her clit. And, even as Sarah penetrated her, and played with her, Mailgirl Number Two reached for massager with her free hand.<br>
<br>
"Plug this in," Sarah instructed, a direction aimed at her sister. "There's a socket right there."<br>
<br>
"Yes, ma'am," Sophie giggled.<br>
<br>
Sarah was forced to use both hands now - to clutch the massager in one, and turn it on with the other. For those briefest of moments, Sophie stepped in, and cradled Erin's slit with her hand, rubbing her clitoris with her palm. And then the buzzing began.<br>
<br>
It was loud. Erin hadn't expected it to be so loud. There were a couple of settings - Erin could hear the speed and volume change as Sarah found what she wanted. Sarah crawled to her knees, coming up in a bastardization of her "Knees," position, and reached for her stepsister's crotch. She had a thumb parallel to Erin's pussy, while pressing down upon the girl's pelvis with the rest of her hand. And then the ball at the end of the massager introduced itself to Erin, Erin's labia parting just enough to welcome it in.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh...ohhh...ohhhh..."<br>
<br>
Two hands were now up over her head, wrapped behind Sophie's behind her. Erin was no longer an active participant here; this was being done to her. Sarah followed Erin's wiggles and wriggles and waggles, changing her grip every now and then. She pushed and pressed the vibrating toy into Erin's pussy, and eased up every now then, chasing Erin's climax as she did so.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh...ohhh...ohhh..."<br>
<br>
Erin felt the build, and new she was getting closer. She licked her lips. She bit her lower lip. She was self-conscious about how loud she was breathing, how much she was panting, and how much she sweating. But when the orgasm hit, any remaining shreds of self-control were tossed aside.<br>
<br>
"Please, please, please..." she begged. "Oh, please. Please! Please!"<br>
<br>
Her body moving with a mind of its own, she sat halfway up and reached for Sarah. As she spasmed, Erin closed her eyes, pulled Sarah towards her so that their foreheads were touching, and called it out.<br>
<br>
"I'm there! I'm there! I'm...ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhhhhhhhhhh..." Her last exhalation was low and guttural, deep and manly.<br>
<br>
Sarah giggled.<br>
<br>
Involuntarily, she reached for her pussy, the intensity of the massager becoming too much. But Sarah fought her, kept it in place, and held her down.<br>
<br>
That's when the second one hit.<br>
<br>
Was it even two separate orgasms? Or was it just one, that struck and then escalated from there? Erin wasn't sure. Her body shook, and cried, "Again! I'm there! I'm there! Oh! Oh! OHHH!!"<br>
<br>
She shivered. "Ohhh...," she exhaled, coming back down. She was winded.<br>
<br>
Sarah was unrelenting. She pulled back a little, but only to reposition herself and her own body. The original mailgirl among them now spread her legs wide, tucked them under and over Erin's, and scooted in closer. Only the massager was between them. Both girls were using the same toy.<br>
<br>
Erin kissed Sarah, laughing with joy as she did so. Erin wasn't sure she could cum yet again so soon, and so - after a few minutes - she swung a leg over Sarah's head, and extricated herself from the tangle of naked Scott sisters. As she did so, Sophie took Erin's place, sliding forward and pressing her sex up against the near side of the massager. Sophie's left leg was over Sarah's right. Sophie right leg was under Sarah's left. Both girls were reacting to the toy.<br>
<br>
Erin was a third wheel in this scenario, but she did her best to make herself useful. She locked lips with Sophie, and kissed her passionately. She ran a hand up and down the younger Scott's body - up past her belly-button, up over the bare skin of midsection, and up and around Sophie's nipples. She ran her nails over the inside of Sarah's thigh, and then stroked the outside of her leg. She took Sarah's right nipple into her mouth, and caressed the left with her hand.<br>
<br>
Sarah came first. "Oh, fuck," she said aloud. "Fuck..."<br>
<br>
"Get it," Erin encouraged her. "Get it, get it." Ben often encouraged Erin in the same manner.<br>
<br>
"Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck..." Sarah swore. She was half laughing, half crying, with her chest heaving up and down and her whole body shuddering on the floor.<br>
<br>
"Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuuuuh..." She began to squeal. And it was over.<br>
<br>
As Sarah pulled back, shielding her pussy from the vibrator with her hand, it was Sophie's turn. Erin wrapped her fingers around the massager's handle. Though Sarah had released her grip, Sophie had not, and Sophie was loath to give up control. With Sarah recovering on the floor in front of her, Sophie now had the toy to herself.<br>
<br>
Erin swung back between the two girls, straddling Sarah's torso and spreading Sophie's legs apart before her. She didn't let go of the massager, but it was Sophie in control, Sophie manipulating it and manhandling it as she saw fit. Erin bent down, and began kissing the inside of Sophie's legs. The smell of pussy was overpowering and intoxicating, the feminine musk of Sophie intermingling with that of Sarah and Erin herself. It was the smell that pornography would never be able to capture - the body's own perfumes and pheromones assaulting Erin's nose, a delicious stink that made the whole thing feel dirtier and naughtier and sexier.<br>
<br>
Sarah had now recovered just enough that she was pulling Erin's hips backwards towards her. Erin felt the blonde's tongue on her before she processed exactly what was happening.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh..." Erin exhaled, startled.<br>
<br>
Sophie was now giggling, herself. Her laughter was interrupted by her in-and-out panting. As well as the occasional little yip of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Erin nibbled on the inside of Sophie's thigh, the vibrator's buzzing loud in her ear. And then it was on to Sarah's pussy. She didn't release her hold on the massager - she wanted to be a part of it, and wanted to contribute to what Sophie was about to experience. But her focus as now on the pink folds that welcomed her tongue.<br>
<br>
If the smell was intoxicating, the taste was otherworldly. It wasn't quite fair to say that Erin hadn't tasted pussy before; she'd tasted her own, every now and then, when going down on Ben after he'd been inside of her. She hadn't liked it, initially, and found the whole thing to be gross. But, given how turned on he'd been, the act had created something of a feedback loop, and Erin had gotten that much more turned on, herself.<br>
<br>
This was different. This was another girl. This was her stepsister. They were locked in embrace with one another, Erin on top, in a sixty-nine. Erin had never gone down on another girl before, but she knew what she'd want. A kiss along the inside of the thigh. A tongue penetrating ever-so slightly.<br>
<br>
Her entire life over, Erin hadn't been a particular fan of the sixty-nine. It had been a year, maybe two, since she and Ben had gotten into this position. She had no issue on the giving end. She was happy to be on the giving end. But, on the receiving end, she was self-conscious about how close her ass was to her husband's face. Here and now, with her face between Sarah's legs, she realized just how right she'd been to be self-conscious - her nose was buried deep in Sarah's perfect, bleached-white asshole. Just as Sarah's own face was, in Erin's.<br>
<br>
This was different, though. Somehow. It only served to drive home just how wicked this all was. Erin moaned to herself, and ground her pussy down hard on to Sarah's face. Sarah had already come up-close-and-personal with Erin's posterior earlier that day, anyways, courtesy of Mr. Giannini. And, all-in at the point, and wanting to make it up to Sarah, Erin pulled away from Sarah's vagina just long enough to run a quick circle around Sarah's asshole.<br>
<br>
"Oh, god!" Sarah called out, her voice comically muffled by Erin's thighs.<br>
<br>
Sophie, by this point, was there. Still giggling to herself, her panting had become that much more noticeable, and the pace quickened as she approached her climax. Tongue firmly planted upon Sarah's clit, Erin craned her neck and glanced up at her other stepsister. Sophie's eyes were closed and her mouth was open.<br>
<br>
"Hunh!" Sophie grunted.<br>
<br>
And then, "Oh! Oh...oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!" Her whole body shook, quivering with sexual release.<br>
<br>
It was too much for Erin. Only minutes after her last orgasm, and in an embarrassingly short amount of time since Sarah had taken her into her mouth again, Erin sung out, "Fuck fuck fuck!" and exploded.<br>
<br>
When all was said and done, Erin had cum five times. Four, maybe - depending on how one determined when her first orgasm had ended and her second had begun. She'd gone down on Sarah. She'd gone down on Sophie. Sarah had gone down on her. Sophie had gone down on her. Sarah and Sophie had gone down on her together. The massager played its part, but was eventually cast aside for the intimacy and immediacy of tongues and teeth and fingers and hands. Sophie had cum again, just riding and grinding on Erin's thigh.<br>
<br>
The silent intensity that dominated the earlier stretches of the session was replaced by more and more joking and laughter. "That feels so, so good," Erin giggled to Sophie at one point. "Deeper, deeper," Sarah had instructed Erin at another. As they took turns getting one another off, or watching one of them get another off, or one of them taking control and getting herself off, they cheered each other on and giggled when there was a successful climax.<br>
<br>
Erin served as a buffer, of sorts, between the two Scott sisters. She knew they'd been intimate with one another before. And, here and there, they'd share a kiss or a caress. But with the massager pushed to one side, Erin became their toy, ready and willing to do anything they asked. Ready and willing to accept anything they did to her.<br>
<br>
Erin was on her back, out of breath, with legs and arms akimbo, when it was all through. Sarah and Sophie were seated a few feet away, with Sophie's head resting on Sarah's naked thigh. They, too, were out of breath. When Sarah glanced at the smartphone still attached to her bicep, she groaned, and announced they needed to get back down to the locker room for nine o'clock. Even if they hustled, she doubted there was time for a shower - it would simply have to wait for the morning.<br>
<br>
Erin didn't need to say anything to her stepsisters. They all understood what this was. At that moment, she felt more connected to them than she had since her father had first brought Catherine Scott home with him. They were more than just stepsisters. They'd now shared more than just stepsisters. They were her family.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Goodbyes were hard. Catherine and Sarah both shed tears, but managed to keep from out-and-out crying. Sophie did her best to comfort them, but had to walk away, lest she succumb to sobs herself.<br>
<br>
It helped, then, that the mailgirls had a limited amount of time between their wake-up call at five o'clock and inspection with Mistress Rei at half-past-six. Once again, the blaring alarm woke them all. The mailgirls removed their eye masks, rose to their feet, and waited their turns to be released.<br>
<br>
The Plaza girls departed first. Erin watched Sarah give each of them long, wistful hugs, and wish them each the best. Plaza Seven, of course, was on the receiving end of a kiss that made Catherine Ryan blush. Plaza Seven, Plaza Ten, Plaza Seventeen, Plaza Eighteen, and Plaza Twenty-One were shooed out the door after a quick bathroom break. They, themselves, had shifts in at USF Plaza that morning, and an inspection waiting for them in their own locker room back downtown. They'd be trucked over the Hudson before the traffic got too bad.<br>
<br>
Park Place's mailgirls were given priority over the visitors at the washikis, priority at the troughs, priority in the showers and at the sinks. They had a deadline, and an inspection, while the visitors did not. Erin, Catherine, Angela Giannini, and the others were told they'd be given their release sometime after seven o'clock, after the actual mailgirls were assigned early morning duties throughout the building. Other than that, they were given no details about exactly when they'd be set free from their collars, when they'd be allowed to get dressed, or when they'd be allowed to leave.<br>
<br>
Or, if.<br>
<br>
Erin was dreading the coming confrontation with Mistress Rei. Or, perhaps, Mistress Rei and some other representative of USF's Human Capital department.<br>
<br>
She'd brought it upon herself. She hadn't needed to tell Mistress Rei that her Christmas wish was to be a mailgirl. And yet the words had escaped before she'd even had a chance to stop herself. And, in a vaccum, the truth of it was that she did want to be a mailgirl. She was jealous of Sarah, of Sophie, and of the other girls. She felt that she hadn't truly, completely had the real "mailgirl experience" over the last two days, given that she hadn't been allowed to shadow her stepsisters on a real shift, in a fully-staffed building. There was a dark pull to it all - the highs and lows, the nadirs and climaxes - that Erin simply wouldn't get to feel outside of this world. She got the appeal now, of having everything stripped away from her, her whole life simplified and streamlined to total submission.<br>
<br>
Visitor D was ready for whatever came next. Erin O'Neill, though? It was more complicated. There was more baggage. There was a life back in LA that she wasn't sure she could turn her back on.<br>
<br>
Not that Erin would have a lot of agency in that decision. She likely wouldn't be given much of a choice.<br>
<br>
No, the visitors would not be required to submit themselves for inspection that morning. There was no requirement to weigh in, no requirement to shave, no requirement to present themselves to Mistress Rei. However, Erin's record was synched to Sophie's in the mailgirl app, and she was still required to report yesterday's more salacious activities to her stepsisters' mistress for the purposes of record-keeping. The girls had strategized the night before, on their way back from 6th Floor, as to what they'd be willing to own up to. Sarah and Sophie had agreed that they'd follow Mailgirl Number Five's lead and fudge the details; a stretch in the stocks or a riding crop across their collective backsides or whatever other punishment Mistress Rei might dream up were preferable alternatives to confessing to incest - borderline though it may have been - with Erin.<br>
<br>
It helped, then, that they'd been seen departing the locker room yesterday afternoon with Ten's massager. There were no cameras in the Monmouth Conference Room - or, at least, Sophie and Sarah believed there were no cameras in the Monmouth Conference Room - and so they thought they could get away with a lesser confession.<br>
<br>
"Once, by myself, in the showers," Erin began. "Ten minutes. Two orgasms. Four, maybe? And then a three?"<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei nodded to Sophie, and Sophie dutifully tapped the metrics into her mistress's tablet. Sophie had gone first, after her inspection, and had been roped into playing recording secretary for the other girls' details.<br>
<br>
"Once, on the phone with my husband," Erin went on. "Five minutes, and just one orgasm. It was a two."<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei cocked an eyebrow. She was reading something into Erin's guess at the intensity of her orgasm while on with Ben.<br>
<br>
The little Japanese woman was back in real clothes - or, at least, what passed as "real clothes" for a mailgirls mistress. She wore a tight-fitting white lace dress, through which her black bikini panties and black bra were plainly visible, and a pair of black boots with heels that gave her an extra couple of inches in height. Gone was yesterday's over-the-top outfit. Erin was struck by just how naked she herself was in comparison; given that she'd been surrounded by almost nothing but naked flesh since Christmas Eve, it had been relatively easy to forget about the nudity.<br>
<br>
Erin swallowed, and went on. "And then one more time, on my own, in the conference room on the 6th Floor. Mailgirls One and Two were both there, though." Sarah had felt it important that they confess to that much, at least. That Erin had gotten herself with her stepsisters present was a raunchy and obscene enough tale to spin without going into further detail. Sophie had disclosed the same moments earlier. "Forty-five minutes. Five orgasms. I'd call them 'fives.' All of them."<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei laughed. "Naughty, naughty girl. You've enjoyed your stay with us."<br>
<br>
It wasn't a question. Still, though, Erin affirmed. "Yes, mistress."<br>
<br>
Sarah, following on, confessed to a litany of crimes and misdeeds, each one more mouth-watering and jaw-dropping than the last. Though she had no intention of coming clean about the session on the 6th Floor, she showed no such hesitation about admitting to being run through by Plaza Seven and the strap-on. By the time she got to Ten's massager in the conference room with Sophie and Erin, it was almost an afterthought.<br>
<br>
Catherine, for her part, had only masturbating at lunchtime to disclose. She'd spent most of the previous evening with Angela Giannini. Nothing sexual, though, had happened between them, and Erin felt an odd combination of jealousy and pity over her stepmother's self-restraint.<br>
<br>
When Catherine was through, Mistress Rei unlocked her from her leash, using the key dangling at her wrist. The Japanese woman then did the same for Erin and Sarah, and gave Sarah a special set of instructions before continuing on to the other girls.<br>
<br>
"Take them both down to my room," Mistress Rei told the blonde girl. "Visitor E can wait for me there. I'll be down when I'm done here. You and Visitor D stay out in the hall. Knees."<br>
<br>
"Yes, mistress," Sarah answered.<br>
<br>
Catherine looked to Sarah, and then to Sophie. Sensing the hesitation, Mistress Rei showed a modicum of humanity; rolling her eyes, she allowed, "You can say your goodbyes to Mailgirl One. Be quick about it. No drama."<br>
<br>
Catherine hugged her younger daughter to her chest, squeezing her tight and refusing to let her go for what seemed an eternity. "I love you," Catherine whispered. And, "Be strong."<br>
<br>
When it was Erin's turn, she did the same. "I'll come back," Erin assured her.<br>
<br>
Sophie smiled. "I'm sure you will."<br>
<br>
Last night had changed things between them. But last night had changed things between them for the better. There was a bond, and an intimacy, that they now shared, and Erin felt closer to her stepsisters than she ever had before. She supposed it was why the mailgirls were as tight-knit as they were - shared experiences, shared highs, and shared lows. She'd opened herself up and exposed herself so completely, in a way that she'd never been able to do before. Even with Ben.<br>
<br>
There were no tears, but Erin had to work hard to make sure there were no tears. With Mistress Rei and Mailgirl Number One moving on to inspect and receive confession from Mailgirl Number Three, Sarah led her mother and stepsister from the locker room one last time.<br>
<br>
Out into the service corridor, and down the stairs across from the locker room, Sarah led them. They descended to the sub-basement, Level B2, where Mistress Rei was every bit the prisoner as any of the mailgirls. It was only a short walk to her room, which stood beside a women's bathroom, and was marked with a simple "0" on an otherwise nondescript heavy metal door. Likely, Mistress Rei's living quarters had been converted from a standard-issue storage room.<br>
<br>
"She wants to be one of us," Sarah had told her. Erin wondered if Mistress Rei was lonely down here. Erin wondered if she had any interaction with Mistress Zero at USF Plaza, as a peer or as a confidante. Erin wondered if she missed the camaraderie of the locker room.<br>
<br>
Unsure of what was to come, Sarah and Catherine said their goodbyes. Again, Catherine lingered too long with a hug - longer even than she had with Sophie, without Mistress Rei's impatience hanging over them. Catherine, too, assured Sarah that she'd be back, and Sarah told her that she was welcome back whenever she wanted; she missed her. Erin heard the door unlock with a quiet "click" as Sarah approached it with the smartphone on her arm, and Catherine was ushered inside.<br>
<br>
Out in the hall, Sarah and Erin got down on their knees. There was a single, pink mailgirls mat, USF logo in the corner, and the two girls squeezed together on top of it. Sarah took Erin's hand in her own, and both assumed the standard "resting" position back on their haunches.<br>
<br>
They talked. It was little more than a whisper, but it was punctuated with smiles. There was no heavy stuff here and now - no explanations, no philosophizing, no sharing of deep, dark truths. Erin's stomach was a mess, butterflies flittering this way and that inside of her, and Sarah seemed to sense that she needed a distraction. The blonde mailgirl joked about what awaited her today; Park Place would likely still be only half-staffed on the day after Christmas, and Sarah speculated that she'd be on her knees, bored out of her mind, on some other mailgirls mat somewhere else in the building. On the day after Thanksgiving, she'd actually been grateful when some bitchy junior executive had forced her to crawl on her hands-and-knees from one delivery to the next. That activity, as humiliating as it might have been, had killed time, and had allowed her to get out of her own head.<br>
<br>
As with Sophie, Erin felt more connected to Sarah, and felt that her relationship with her stepsister had grown stronger over the last thirty-six hours. What could have been awkward and weird in the aftermath of last night felt - instead - easy and warm. There was nothing like orgasming in front of another person that felt so honest and revealing, and Erin was glad she'd broken her promise to Ben to "stay good." Even in a world in which she might have been capable of doing so, she would have missed out, and never really understood the need. The desperation. The submission. The release. Her trip to Jersey City would have been lesser for it.<br>
<br>
Visitor C hadn't succumbed. Or, at least, Erin didn't believe she had; she'd left before Mailgirl Seven or her sister had been forced to report. Neither had Mailgirl Number Twelve's aunt, Visitor G. She'd witnessed Visitor H diddle herself at the party the other night, and wondered if Visitor I had done the same, at some other point. For the most part, the visitors had played along with the mailgirls. They'd played along as mailgirls. Erin was sure she wasn't the only one feeling the gravity of this life, and she was sure she wasn't the only one with mixed emotions about the idea of getting dressed and returning home to her normal day-to-day.<br>
<br>
According to the clock on Sarah's smartphone, it was half past seven by the time Mistress Rei finally joined them in the sub-basement. Erin and Catherine were overdue for dismissal by thirty minutes at that point, though they'd given themselves more than enough time to make their flights at Newark. Sarah was sent scurrying off up the stairs on coffee duty for the upper floors, but Mistress Rei barely acknowledged Erin's presence as she breezed past her and into her room.<br>
<br>
Sarah took one long, last look in Erin's direction, and smiled. She was at peace. She was doing this and living this life, maybe not because she really wanted to, but because maybe it was who she really was, and who she really had been all along. She was more sure of herself, and more confident, than the academic Erin had known before. This made sense to her in a way that maybe Pepperdine or Yale hadn't, and Erin was sure that this current contract wouldn't be Sarah's last. Maybe she'd finish her PhD. Maybe she wouldn't. Maybe it would be pushed out to some future date, when US Financial or whoever else was done with her. Maybe she'd become the world's foremost scholar on the sociocultural anthropological underpinnings of life among the mailgirls. Maybe she'd become the next Mistress Rei. Maybe she'd settle down with Plaza Seven. Maybe she'd get married to some kind soul, like Ben, and pump out a couple of kids.<br>
<br>
For now, though, Sarah was a mailgirl. She needn't worry about any of that. Her next deadline was as far into the future as she needed to fret over, and there was a freedom in that that Erin envied.<br>
<br>
But maybe Erin wouldn't need to be jealous for long.<br>
<br>
Whatever the conversation was between Mistress Rei and Catherine Ryan, it wasn't a long one. Still, it was long enough that Erin was left alone in her own thoughts in that empty corridor. And it was long enough that Catherine had gotten fully dressed by the time that Erin was eventually summoned in.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei's quarters were simple and uncluttered. A Queen mattress sat atop a box spring in one corner, the box spring flat on the floor. The bed was neatly made, a garish and girlish pink comforter pulled tight over it. A wardrobe was to Erin's left, on one side of the door, and there was a laundry hamper beside it. There were three flat-screen televisions mounted on the wall, but Erin doubted Mistress Rei had a cable package; instead, a rotating series of CCTV images flashed across the screen, allowing Erin a peek into the now-empty locker room and into the rest of Park Place. A simple metal desk, rescued from some earlier era, was in the center of the room, and behind it sat Mistress Rei.<br>
<br>
Catherine wore a red tannin sleeveless dress, with a conservative neckline and a flirty, slinky tulip hem. She wore her heels from the other day, and her coat was draped over her suitcase. As Mistress Rei occupied the only chair in the room, Catherine was leaning, casually, up against the wall. Her breasts sagged a bit, and Erin now knew that a side trip for lingerie would be required before heading to the airport. She could probably fly home without panties, but a bra seemed like a necessity. Not for the first time, she cursed USF for robbing her of her underthings.<br>
<br>
Catherine's smile was reassuring, and Erin finally exhaled. Her own suitcase stood alongside her stepmother's, and it was comforting to see it. There was no dog carrier, waiting with an open door to ship Erin off to another world.<br>
<br>
Erin's relief, however, was short-lived. As she approached the desk, she saw that Mistress Rei did, indeed, have a contract waiting for her. Catherine's collar, unlocked and its former occupant liberated, sat in one corner. But the big, bold letters on the first page of the documents stole focus; "Slave Contract," it read.<br>
<br>
She felt her whole world drop out from under her. "I can't," she stammered, and took an involuntary step backwards. Now that she was here, and now that the moment was upon her, all she wanted was to be back in Ben's arms.<br>
<br>
"I'll wait for you," he had promised her.<br>
<br>
"Feet!" Mistress Rei barked, and nodded to an imaginary spot before her desk.<br>
<br>
Erin complied. She took a wide stance, thrust out her chest, clutched her hands behind her back, and cast her eyes down towards the floor. She could now only see the contract out of the corner of her eye, but she could feel its presence in the room.<br>
<br>
"This is a contract," Mistress Rei explained. "This is your contract. It is for you to sign."<br>
<br>
"I can't," Erin said again, feeling like she was about to start sobbing. "I can't. I can't, mistress."<br>
<br>
"It's also your Christmas present," Catherine added.<br>
<br>
"Tell me. What is that you want from Santa?" Mistress Rei had asked her yesterday morning. "More than anything in the world?"<br>
<br>
"This girl wants to be a mailgirl," Erin had mewed.<br>
<br>
"That, we can do," the Japanese woman had assured her.<br>
<br>
"It's your Christmas present from Ben," Catherine continued.<br>
<br>
Erin was confused.<br>
<br>
"You're not a fit for USF," Mistress Rei insulted her. "Good tits, yes. Good body, yes. Pretty face, yes. The tattoo? Won't work for Manhattan. Won't work for Park Place. The company could overlook it, maybe, in some other office. San Francisco, perhaps? Los Angeles? We're expanding to other offices this Spring, and you're welcome to put in an application. But we have standards at USF. We have profiles we look for. We have girls with futures and ambition and goals.<br>
<br>
"You?" Mistress Rei sized her up, "You don't belong. For our program to be a success, we need our people to exert dominance over the mailgirls. And they can't exert dominance over someone so ready to roll over and spread her legs for any passers-by."<br>
<br>
Erin was too much of a slut to be a mailgirl. She wanted this too badly. She needed it too much. The words stung.<br>
<br>
"We like our girls with fight," Mistress Rei went on. "There are other programs that would gladly welcome you into the fold. We do business with Donovan Runnels in LA, and can arrange an interview. If that's what you want."<br>
<br>
"Fabrikam," Erin said softly. "They're nearby." She wasn't negotiating for her life. She was negotiating for her commute.<br>
<br>
"Fabrikam," Mistress Rei nodded. "I'm sure we can put in a good word, and provide some photos. But you have another opportunity before you."<br>
<br>
"Ben," Catherine spoke. "You have a contract from Ben."<br>
<br>
Erin looked up, and met her stepmother's eyes with a question.<br>
<br>
It was Mistress Rei, however, who explained. "Your husband wrote up a contract for you. Sent it with you stepmother. No clothes in the house. Chores, sexual and otherwise. Punishments. Spankings. Paddlings. Lashes. He wants you as his slave."<br>
<br>
"That's not..." Erin began, and shook her head. "That's not Ben."<br>
<br>
"It's not Ben," Catherine agreed. "I read it. I promised him I wouldn't, but I couldn't help myself. It's not Ben. But it is you."<br>
<br>
Erin now looked to the "Slave Contract" on Mistress Rei's desk. No company would have dared to use that word - so thin was the line between induction into the mailgirl ranks and outright slavery. "Indentured servitude," maybe, but even that was a loaded term. Ben wanted to make her his slave.<br>
<br>
No, it wasn't Ben who wanted to make her his slave. It was Erin who needed it. It was Erin who'd fallen down the rabbit's hole and become obsessed with life among the mailgirls, life as a mailgirl. It was Erin who'd gobbled up every bit of gossip and news and the pictures she could get her hands on. It was Erin who was scanning through the message boards on Mailgirls Exposed and Mailgirl Submissions and the Post Office and the Heteroclite. It was Erin who'd flown across the country, under the auspices of visiting her stepsisters, and stripped down to experience what it meant to be a mailgirl firsthand. It was Erin who needed to submit to someone, to be controlled, to be owned.<br>
<br>
And Ben was going to try to give that to her.<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei didn't make her sign the contract then and there; she wasn't the authority in this particular matter. Instead, she allowed Erin to get dressed.<br>
<br>
Skirt. Blouse. Boots. Jewelry. Coat. Her intimate apparel had been liberated from her, destined to be mounted and hung in some picture frame like a hunting trophy, or to be handed out like a prize to some senior sales executive. She and Catherine did, indeed, stop at a department store for bras and underwear on their way to Newark, and they made no secret of the fact that they'd wear their purchases out to a young, judgmental cashier.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until she was at her gate that Erin finally read through Ben's contract from start to finish.<br>
<br>
"The Slave agrees to submit completely to the Master in all ways."<br>
<br>
"The Master accepts the responsibility of the Slave body and all her worldly possessions, to do with as he sees fit."<br>
<br>
"The Slave agrees to accept any punishment or correction the Master decides to inflict, whether earned or not."<br>
<br>
"Above all else, it is the Slave's duty to please."<br>
<br>
She'd be required to undress in the garage after work. She'd be required to get dressed in same said garage before work. She'd be required to shower in the back yard, with the hose, unless her master felt she'd earned the right to shower indoors. Their bed was now Ben's bed only, and she'd be allowed into it only to provide him with pleasure; otherwise, she was to sleep on a dog's bed at the foot. She was to wear a collar at all times around the house, but would otherwise be kept naked. She was to cook him meals, but she herself would be fed mailgirl chow morning and night, lunches on the weekends. She'd be fed out of a bowl on the floor, at his feet. She was to keep the house spotless. She'd be expected to weigh herself each morning, and report that number to her master. She was not to masturbate unless he was there to witness it. She was not to cum without his permission. Though she doubted he had it in him to do so, her master had the right to invite guests to their house to see her in all her glory - male or female - and she had the responsibility to please them - male or female - in any way, shape, or form that her master saw fit.<br>
<br>
She loved him for it. No, this wasn't Ben. But Ben was attempting to give her what she wanted and needed, the spark she'd begun to feel that Fall, the spark that she'd fanned into a full-blown wildfire here in New Jersey. She was naughty. She was dirty. She was his.<br>
<br>
She slipped the contract back into her carry-on. She'd signed it, in pen, while checking her luggage.<br>
<br>
Erin wasn't sure it was going to work. She'd discovered something in herself that she wasn't sure Ben could handle. She wasn't sure that Ben would be enough. She wasn't sure that exposing herself to Ben and Ben alone was going to satisfy the burgeoning exhibitionist within her. She wasn't sure that Ben would be able to dominate her - to be mean to her, to humiliate her, to put her down - in the way she worried she'd now need.<br>
<br>
But he'd try. And for that, she loved him.<br>
<br>
And if didn't work? If it wasn't enough? Well, then, Fabrikam was just down the road. Capstone Partners and Donovan Runnels were in-town. And US Financial would be expanding to Los Angeles in the Spring...
