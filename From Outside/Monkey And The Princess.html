<p id="C1">
Once upon a time, in ancient China, there lived a princess.<br>
<br>
What was the princess's name, you ask? Why, I'm only too happy to tell you. The princess's name was Tang Ling, and she was known far and wide across the land as the most beautiful princess in all the Middle Kingdom. She was fair in her complexion, graceful in her step, delicate in her features and thoughtful in her choices. In tea pouring, in paper folding, in archery and swordplay and horsemanship and the composition of odes to the moon, she was without question the most brilliant scholar that the people of China had ever seen.<br>
<br>
Yes, the princess Tang Ling was perfect in every way. The only trouble was, she knew it.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
One day it came to pass that Tang Ling heard a rumor of trouble in the western provinces, in the mountain passes that lay beyond the city of Chang'an.<br>
<br>
There was at that time a fashion among the noble ladies of Chang'an to visit the hot springs of that region, and bathe in sunlit splendour among the bamboo and the mountain pines. In fact, there was a rather remarkable hot spring at the foot of Mount Li, not far beyond the city gates. Up to this spring the ladies would climb, their gentle feet brushing the stone steps, the crisp air filling their lungs as they babbled excitedly about the newest fashions and the latest drama in court.<br>
<br>
Then, the pools, warm and steaming. The ladies passed through the red gate, tipping the attendant with the single coin each had brought for the purpose. They gathered by the shore, among the rushes and the flat, water-smoothed stones.<br>
<br>
There, in reverent silence, they disrobed.<br>
<br>
Of course, these were the finest and most noble ladies of Chang'an. Each one an exquisite beauty. Each different from her companions, yet all subtly alike - just as a range of mountain peaks may each have different contours, yet express one calm and heavenly unity. The finest silk robes slithered to the ground - or rather the spotless stone platform, brushed clean every morning with a hundred strokes by the spring attendant.<br>
<br>
And there they stood. Eight exquisite, porcelain-skinned Chinese beauties, casting bashful looks at each other and at the forest which surrounded them.<br>
<br>
One slim as a reed, one with full high breasts that were quietly the envy of the others. One with a bottom as tender and inviting as a summer peach. One with luscious dark hair that came all the way down to her waist. One with high cheekbones and a haughty, imperious look in her almond eyes. One short, impertinent tomboy with a glint of boyish mischief in her smile. One dreamy scholar, a faraway look on her moon-shaped face. And one who was frankly even more beautiful than the other seven, though nobody could say exactly how.<br>
<br>
One by one, they slipped into the water, knowing they were perfectly safe from prying eyes. The Emperor himself had forbidden anyone to violate the sanctity of the hot springs. Nobody would dare transgress upon them.<br>
<br>
Nobody, that is, except for Monkey.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
He wasn't actually a monkey, of course.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps he was. Sometimes, in ancient China, it was hard to tell. He was quick, and agile, and clever, and like to play tricks, which are all qualities of monkeys. But he could talk, which is not a quality of monkeys, unless they've been even more clever than we think.<br>
<br>
And he liked human women. Which monkeys are normally impartial to. So he must have been a human, after all. Unless he was a very special monkey.<br>
<br>
Where did Monkey come from?<br>
<br>
Some say the King of Heaven made him out of clay to win a bet, while others argue he was born on a mountaintop when a bird collided with a song. Nobody truly knows. All I can say for sure about Monkey is that he was nimble, and mischievous, and he didn't care a fig for any of the Emperor's decrees. Rules didn't matter to Monkey. He did whatever he wanted, and he went wherever he pleased.<br>
<br>
So he crouched on the branch of a pine tree, looking down. If any of the beauties currently standing at the pool's edge had looked up, they would have seen Monkey. No doubt they would have screamed and scattered, and the Emperor's guards would have been summoned, and Monkey would have been locked up in the deepest darkest cell in all of China. But they didn't, so he wasn't.<br>
<br>
Instead he crouched in his pine tree, and watched in quiet fascination as the eight most noble and most beautiful women in Chang'an slipped out of their silk robes and stood by the edge of the steaming water. Completely naked. Quite unaware that every inch of their lovely bodies was on display for Monkey's entertainment.<br>
<br>
Of course, this was forbidden. The noblewomen of ancient China prized their modesty above all else. They were supposed to be demure, graceful flowers, their hair bound and their charms concealed behind layer upon layer of fine silk. Nobody was allowed to see them naked, except their husbands, and then only on special occasions.<br>
<br>
Yet underneath all that silk, behind all that etiquette, the eight naked beauties had breasts and bottoms and pussies like everyone else. Very lovely breasts, some small and cute, some plump as pomegranates with coral-pink nipples that stiffened in the cold. Very lovely bottoms, some peachy-pert, some round and strong and fulsome and a great temptation to any wandering hand.<br>
<br>
And eight vaginas of surpassing excellence. Tender lips between silky thighs, pale mounds of Venus adorned with carefully trimmed triangles of hair as dark as midnight. Yes, Monkey was awfully fond of women's pussies, and he feasted his eyes on the spectacle that was now laid out before him. Eight noble pussies, utterly forbidden to the eyes of commoners, all for him to see.<br>
<br>
He wanted to drop down, to pinch and spank and ogle, to make the women squeal as he capered among them, revelling in their shock and their confusion. But what if the guards were called? Monkey had a better plan.<br>
<br>
He waited until the women had slipped into the water, watching until every last inch of lovely skin had sunk beneath the steaming surface. Ripples hid their lovely figures as the eight beauties splashed and played, giggling in excitement, ducking each other, or simply relaxing on a stone bench and drinking in the beauty of nature. Still quite unaware that they were being watched.<br>
<br>
Then, once he was quiet sure nobody was looking, he descended from his pine tree, quiet as the stillness that hangs in the air on a calm night in the western desert. And, one by one, he picked up each silk robe. They were light as gossamer, though modest, and hung in a bundle over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
This was one of Monkey's favorite games. As many a lonely peasant girl had found out, to her chagrin. He liked throwing fruit at people from trees, or picking the pockets of fat merchants. But his favorite joke of all was to follow a beautiful young maiden to some secluded bathing spot, watch her slip into the water and make off with all her clothes.<br>
<br>
Monkey liked women. He liked them clothed, he liked them naked. But he particularly liked them crouching behind bushes, creeping through the forest, peering out at busy roads and wondering how under Heaven they were ever going to get home.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Lin Yan, the tomboy, was the first to notice.<br>
<br>
There was an empty space where all their silk robes should have been. A gap in the fabric of the necessary. On another day, she thought, she could have written quite a fine poem about it.<br>
<br>
Maybe not. Lin Yan preferred archery to poetry. But right now, neither was useful. What she needed was neither archery or poetry, but clothes.<br>
<br>
She suddenly felt very vulnerable. She cast a suspicious eye at the branches of the overhanging pines, which were empty. Monkey had gone.<br>
<br>
The eight woman debated what to do. Eventually they decided that the bravest one among them should go and tell the bath attendant to fetch them some more clothes.<br>
<br>
So Lin Yan climbed out of the bath, shielding her small breasts and neat bush, her pert bottom trembling as she trotted along down the path towards the red gate. There she found the attendant had vanished, nowhere to be found. She looked at his booth, and saw that it was empty.<br>
<br>
She put her hands on her hips and said "Where, oh, where, can that attendant be?"<br>
<br>
There was a rustle from the branches overhead, and Monkey dropped down from the trees with the attendant's cap on his head, grinning broadly. "Do not fret," he said, as Lin Yan shrieked and cupped her arms ever more tightly to her lithe, dripping body. "I am here!"<br>
<br>
"You are not the attendant," snapped Lin Yan, and brought her fist down as hard as she could in the direction of Monkey's head. "What have you done with him?"<br>
<br>
"Don't worry your pretty little head about it," suggested Monkey, rolling nimbly out of the way of her fist. "For you have bigger troubles, o pretty Lin Yan. I have stolen all your clothes!"<br>
<br>
"So it was you! Give them back!"<br>
<br>
"But why should I? You are ever so charming in your current condition. Garments would not improve you."<br>
<br>
"I disagree," said Lin Yan, feinting left, then aiming to trip up Monkey with a sweeping kick. He jumped over her leg, and said "Do you think you can beat me?"<br>
<br>
"I am the finest archer, wrestler, horse rider, swordswoman, chess player and calligrapher in Chang'an. Only Tang Ling is finer than me, and you are not Tang Ling."<br>
<br>
"How are you at poetry?"<br>
<br>
"I'm better at archery," Lin Yan admitted.<br>
<br>
"A pity. Poetry is the only thing I like as much as women's pussies. Had you written me a fine poem, I might have let you go. As it stands, I will have to entertain myself by looking at your pussy."<br>
<br>
"You'll do no such thing," snapped Lin Yan, both hands cupping her mound of Venus as she saw where Monkey's eyes were going. Water dripped from the nipples of her small breasts, as soft and inviting as the clouds of sunrise over the eastern sea. "Tell me where you hid my clothes!"<br>
<br>
"Defeat me, and the treasure shall be yours."<br>
<br>
"With ease," said Lin Yan, aiming a kick at Monkey's head. Had she the use of both hands, she could easily have defeated him. Unfortunately, she was too modest to reveal her body, making her quite incapable of winning. Monkey drew out the fight, teasing her, letting her almost catch him, then twisting away at the last second and slapping her on the bottom while she yelped in impotent rage.<br>
<br>
Finally, he threw a coil or two of rope around her head and drew it tight. In moments, Lin Yan was bound, her ankles lashed together and her hands harnessed helplessly behind her back. The rope framed her small breasts, cinched her waist and held her knees together. Monkey ogled her shamelessly, admiring the way she twisted and sputtered in frustration.<br>
<br>
"Now," he said, "you have lost, and you shall go where I please."<br>
<br>
"I shall not," said Lin Yan, and jumped a foot in the air as Monkey brought a slender green branch down against her pert bottom, leaving a red stripe across her nubile, peachy cheeks. "You shall," he insisted, driving her forward, down the hillside. "That is what losing means, Lin Yan."<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Some time later, Monkey and Lin Yan - the former beaming, the latter scowling and still nude - came to a stone post, erected by the side of a flat, well-maintained road at the base of a mountain pass. Three young merchants and a donkey were sitting on the ground beside the post, and they sprang to their feet as Monkey approached.<br>
<br>
"What is this?" said one of the merchants, hastily doffing his silk hat. "I can tell from the beauty of this maiden's countenance that she must be of noble blood, perhaps one of the famous beauties of Chang'an. But she has no clothes! Not that I'm complaining."<br>
<br>
"Aye," said another merchant, this one a bearded man from distant Khotan. "You be a most pleasant vision, maid. Thy pussy's a sight to behold, and thy tits aren't so bad either, though a trifle small."<br>
<br>
"This brute has used foul tricks to capture me! Slay him, and your reward shall be more jewels than a camel can mmph." Monkey had plucked a length of silk from one of the merchant's baskets, and fashioned it into a sturdy gag.<br>
<br>
"Nobody will rescue you," he explained, securing Lin Yan firmly to the stone post with more silk. "Not after they read this."<br>
<br>
And, borrowing a small paintbrush from the merchants, he crouched before Lin Yan and began to write characters all down her body, from the hollow of her throat to the tender place just above her pussy. Her small breasts, her flat belly, gleamed with dark ink.<br>
<br>
The third merchant, a woman in a white linen veil, squinted at the writing, and began to read it out loud.<br>
<br>
"Lin Yan is like the sunset,<br>
<br>
Seen by everyone, blushing red,<br>
<br>
But unlike the dusk, she lingers,<br>
<br>
Watch her as you like. She will not fade.<br>
<br>
Her nipples, jewels; her pussy a wet flower,<br>
<br>
Her shame a controlled fire, burning hot,<br>
<br>
Caged, yet never dying. See her stripped<br>
<br>
A maiden of Chang'an, her beauty bare,<br>
<br>
A stolen emerald, passed from hand to hand.<br>
<br>
But weep not, for her punishment is just.<br>
<br>
She challenged Monkey, and was duly spanked.<br>
<br>
He took away her clothing and her pride<br>
<br>
And though her toes curl as she tries to hide<br>
<br>
Lin Yan must stand here, naked, mortified.<br>
<br>
So spread this foolish tale far and wide."<br>
<br>
The veiled woman nodded. "I have no love for your tricks, Monkey," she said, "and would cheerfully untie this woman, but it would be a shame to deny the world this beautiful poem. And, I must admit, she makes quite a charming decoration."<br>
<br>
Lin Yan whimpered into her gag and wriggled helplessly against her silk bonds. More merchants were coming down the road. A whole caravan of them. An insufferable smirk was plastered over Monkey's face as he stood looking at her, eyes roaming freely over her nude form, alighting like butterflies on her nipples.<br>
<br>
"Just one more touch," he said, and painted arrows pointing to her pussy, ensuring nobody could possibly miss it. Finally, he wrote the character for "fool" on her forehead and leaned in to whisper something in her ear. "Now I'm going to play with your friends! And don't forget, you were too weak to help them!"<br>
<br>
And then he was gone.<br>
<br>
And though Lin Yan squirmed and struggled mightily, every muscle in her toned body flexing against the silk as the merchant caravan trotted ever closer, there was no way to escape her destiny. Which was for hundreds of people, from all over the world, to see her naked and mocked and defeated. To ogle her pussy, to comment on the size of her tits, to memorize the poem on her body so they could share it with their friends.<br>
<br>
She knew the poem would spread far and wide. Monkey had a way of telling stories so that everyone remembered them. She would be known for thousands of years, not as the finest archer in Chang'An, but as Lin Yan the Fool, who thought she could challenge Monkey and got tricked into showing the whole world her naked pussy.<br>
<br>
And there was nothing she could do about it. So Lin Yan spent the rest of the day at the stone post, blushing and fuming and squirming and whimpering, on display for all the merchants, naked. And it was completely mortifying, and they all had a good laugh at her expense.<br>
<br>
But where does Tang Ling come into it? Well, for that you'll have to listen to the next part of the story.
</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>






<p id="C2">
China is a large place, and news can travel slow along its many winding mountain roads. Tang Ling considered it her duty to defend the fairer sex in every part of the Middle Kingdom - from the banks of the Yellow River to the coastal flats of Fujian, from the Sichuan jungle highlands to the endless rolling grasslands of the north. So it was some time before word reached her, at a village in the south, in the middle of a fierce battle with the notorious Red Spear bandits, that a humble monkey was tormenting the women of Chang'an.<br>
<br>
"How dare he!" cried Tang Ling, and, overcome with righteous fury, knocked a dozen bandits out with a single swipe of her sword. (She had mastered the art of stabbing bandits in such a way that it only knocked them out.) "This insult to Chinese womanhood cannot go unavenged. I shall capture the foul primate, if primate and not man he be (for it's often difficult to tell in ancient China). He shall languish for eternity in the deepest, darkest dungeon of the Imperial City, sore regretting the day that he came to provoke the princess Tang Ling."<br>
<br>
And off she rode to Chang'an.<br>
<br>
We shall skip over the many adventures she had along the way, fascinating though they were. I need not tell you of how she wrestled a dragon in the Valley of Ten Pearls, or conquered the Seven Spider Women and left them bound in their own webs. You must be impatient! So I shall tell you only of how she came to the excellent city of Chang'an, after many moons of travel - and the dreadful sight she saw as she rode through his gates.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
But what was this dreadful sight, you ask? What spectacle could be so astonishing that even the princess Tang Ling, who has ridden the Fish of Destiny and watched the thunder gods duel over the eastern sea, would be brought to a swift halt by its cruel magnificence?<br>
<br>
Calm yourself, I say! Stop pestering me with these insidious questions! I am the storyteller here, and you must allow me to proceed at my own pace. All shall be revealed in good time - including, perhaps, if you stay quiet and are very, very well-behaved, the lovely naked body of Tang Ling. I make no promises, but it is not implausible that she should find herself in a condition of reluctant nudity, come tale's end.<br>
<br>
Wait, though. Take a breath. It won't kill you to listen to a few more adjectives first.<br>
<br>
We must return to the hot spring, at the foot of Mount Li, where seven very beautiful and very naked maidens waited in the steaming waters for Lin Yan to come back. It was a long wait, and uncomfortable. The sun rose ever so slowly towards its peak (for it was morning). The maidens contemplated the tragic fate that awaited them, should Lin Yan not return.<br>
<br>
Lady Meichang was the first to break the silence.<br>
<br>
"What on earth are we to do?" she said<br>
<br>
"Well, we can't stay here forever," said Jade Flower, the most pragmatic of the seven remaining maidens, now that Lin Yan had left. "I've heard these hills are haunted by goblins at night."<br>
<br>
"But we can't go home," pointed out Meichang. "We're all so..." She fell silent.<br>
<br>
"Naked?" suggested Jade Flower.<br>
<br>
Meichang's pale cheeks flushed pink, and she ducked down below the surface of the water. Blushes adorned the faces of the other six maidens, as well, as they glanced at one another, each hoping that someone else would be able to come up with a miraculous solution to their shared problem. None emerged.<br>
<br>
"Perhaps I was wrong," admitted Jade Flower, feeling remarkably abashed herself, as she watched the other maidens shiver in dreadful anticipation at the thought of forfeiting their hard-won noble dignity to the eyes of some rough-hewn roadside peasant. "Perhaps we can stay here forever. How bad could it possibly be?"<br>
<br>
"It would certainly suit me," said Monkey, dropping out of the pine tree he'd been hiding in. "That way I won't have to go anywhere. I can stay here, at the foot of the mountain where the sun is bright and the air is clean and fresh, and ogle you all."<br>
<br>
The maidens all shrieked in unison, and ducked down below the surface of the water, which luckily for Monkey was very clear. He capered by the side of the pool, doing a little monkey dance and pointing to each girl in turn as intimate parts of their anatomy struck his fancy.<br>
<br>
"Oh, Lady Meichang! How sweet your nipples are! Do not pretend you cannot hear me! And, Jade Flower, your breasts are not as plump as I like, but your bottom's as round as a peach! Move your hands, please, girls! Ah, but it is such a pleasure to have the seven loveliest maidens in Chang'an all to myself!"<br>
<br>
"I was right," cried Jade Flower, and propelled herself towards the water's edge. She climbed out onto the shore, and crouched on a flat rock, cupping her hands protectively over her small but cute breasts and pert round bottom, tender and inviting as a summer peach. "We can't stay here forever. Girls, let's flee into the woods. That way we can hide, and he can't chase all of us."<br>
<br>
And, wasting no time, since Monkey was pointing and laughing at her, she sprinted for the shadows of the trees, and disappeared from view into the underbrush. Less than twenty sparrow heartbeats later, there came a squeal, exactly like that of a woman who had just received an uncomfortable and very humiliating surprise.<br>
<br>
"Of course," said Monkey, "as you know, those woods are haunted by goblins."<br>
<br>
"G-g-goblins?" said Lady Meichang, who had full high breasts that were quietly the envy of the others, silky dark hair and wide-almond shaped eyes that grew wider as she gazed uneasily at the woods around her. "But surely goblins only come out at night?"<br>
<br>
"You don't really know very much about goblins, do you?"<br>
<br>
"No, I suppose not," admitted Lady Meichang, sitting on an underwater bench and lowering her gaze modestly so she didn't have to look at Monkey's leering eyes. One hand tucked primly between her folded legs, the other cupped protectively over her sweet nipples, the whole of her pale, elegant body visible beyond the teasing veil of the water's surface, she made a lovely sight, which Monkey appreciated to the fullest. The other girls squirmed and huddled behind each other as Monkey's eyes flickered over them, not wanting to miss even the briefest moment of their lovely nude ordeal. "How do goblins work, exactly?"<br>
<br>
"Why, they come out in the day all the time! But for one reason, and one reason only. To catch beautiful maidens, and spirit them away to the goblin kingdom in the distant mountains to the west."<br>
<br>
"And what do they do to the maidens," asked Lady Meichang, a little nervously, feeling the heat of Monkey's glittering gaze as it swept over her defenceless body, "once they have them in the goblin kingdom in the distant mountains to the west."<br>
<br>
"I'm so glad you asked," said Monkey, grinning from ear to ear. "First, they shave the girls from neck to toe, and slather them in a specially formulated goblin unguent, made from phoenix fluff and mountain ginger, concentrating especially on those very delectable regions of your person that you are right now doing your utmost to conceal from me, Lady Meichang. It makes the skin especially sensitive, you see. And then they fetch a hive of Mongolian tickle worms..."<br>
<br>
He went on in this vein for some time, articulating every last spicy detail of the bitter fate that awaited every nubile and elegant maiden unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of goblins. Every refined degradation, every subtle torment, every pinch and prickle and calculated insult to the unlucky lady as she was pressed into years or even decades of humiliating servitude. All of it true, as far as he knew, except for the one minor point that goblins had never to his knowledge been sighted within a hundred miles of these mountains.<br>
<br>
The maidens gasped and cowered, eyes wide with fear, faces flushed pink with first- and second-hand embarrassment, as he described how they would be made to polish the stone floors of the vast goblin kitchens, naked, on all fours, copper bells attached to their nipples and goblin jesters striding behind them with whips, reddening their pert bare posteriors and shouting at them to go faster. Once he'd finished, Meichang said "Oh, no!"<br>
<br>
"Indeed."<br>
<br>
"But how can we escape this awful fate!"<br>
<br>
"Simple," Monkey said, shrugging. "Just hide in the trees, and cover your bodies. The goblins will think they don't want to be seen, and leave you alone out of sympathy."<br>
<br>
Lady Meichang blinked.<br>
<br>
"That... doesn't sound right," she said.<br>
<br>
"It's a well-known fact about goblins. But perhaps you're not as wise as you seem, Lady Meichang? Odd. I thought the maidens of Chang'an were all brilliant scholars."<br>
<br>
"Of course I am!" But Meichang still hesitated. "So you're telling me that if we make our way back to Chang'an by means of secret paths through the forests, and be sure to conceal our... certain regions with our hands, the goblins won't get us?"<br>
<br>
"Precisely," said Monkey, wearing a broad grin. "As fast as possible, since goblins hate speed. And whatever you do, don't sing. Goblins love singing, especially songs about how silly women are and how smart Monkey is. If you sing at the top of your voices, they'll definitely come and get you right away."<br>
<br>
Meichang took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
"At last I've got you, Monkey," she said. "You've been too clever for your own good. That's a pack of lies. Obviously, you want us to be caught by goblins."<br>
<br>
"Now why would I want a thing like that?" Monkey said, innocently.<br>
<br>
"Because... because... because of monkey reasons!" Meichang stood up on the underwater bench, hands on her hips, glowering at Monkey, doing her best to fix him with a deadly stare that would fry him to ashes where he stood. Water dripped enticingly down the slopes of her full breasts, their stiff nipples pointing directly at Monkey. Droplets were caught in her damp pubic hair, beading in the silky tangle, adorning her pearly pale mound of Venus and the secretive pink folds of her nether lips. Her arms trembled as she held them, with an effort of will, at her sides.<br>
<br>
"You're not fooling me, Monkey," she snapped. "We're going to walk all the way back to Chang'an right down the centre of the main road, hands by our sides, slowly, singing foolish tavern songs about how silly women are at the tops of our lungs, and there's nothing you can do about it!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, no!" said Monkey, who fell over backwards into the mud, and started to cry. He looked completely helpless and pathetic, rolling around in the dirt with tears pouring from his eyes. "That's exactly what I didn't want you to do! I'm so, so stupid! How could this have happened!"<br>
<br>
"Serves you right," said Lady Meichang, and climbed out of the pool to give him a kick. All the other maidens followed suit, gathering around Monkey to kick him as hard as they could with their dainty little feet, which wasn't very hard. In no time at all he was thoroughly defeated, and they tied a stone around his ankles and pushed him into the pool. They would have taken his clothes off, first, but he was only wearing a leather loincloth and they couldn't get the knot undone.<br>
<br>
"That settles that," said Meichang, brushing off her hands. "Now we just have to, ah... oh, dear. I suppose we have to do the thing I said earlier."<br>
<br>
"But, Meichang," one of the other girls pointed out, "the road will be terribly busy this time of day, and it's ever such a long way back to Chang'an. Do we really, um... do we have to?"<br>
<br>
"Of course we do." Meichang steeled her nerves, and resisted the impulse to cup her hands over her bouncing breasts, which would soon be on display for every peasant, merchant, trader and traveller in the whole of the western provinces to gawk at. "Do you want Monkey to win?"<br>
<br>
"Of course not, Lady Meichang."<br>
<br>
"Then let's go, you little fool." Lady Meichang set her jaw, not looking forward to the upcoming ordeal. Her hands twitched, wanting to shield her pussy, which tingled as if a thousand eyes were staring at it from the trees. She felt herself shiver, and controlled it. It was too late to change her mind. She'd made her decision, and there was no way she was going to lose face in front of the other girls by changing it now.<br>
<br>
"Does anyone know," she said, "any good tavern songs?"<br>
<br>
And so six pert wiggling bottoms, round and pale and prettier than six full moons, vanished down the long winding road that led through the forests and the foothills of the mountains, all the way back to Chang'an. As Monkey emerged from the hot spring, having rapidly chewed through the knot attached to his ankle, he heard the distant sound of women singing, just a hint of hesitation in their voices as they hit the high notes.<br>
<br>
"Oh, I've kissed girls in every town from here to Samarkand,

And there's one thing about women that you've got to understand,

They're not as smart as Monkey is, they're no match for his wits,

He'll make them take their clothes off and show the world their tits.

Peasant girls and princesses, Monkey strips them all,

He makes them walk home naked, and sometimes even crawl,

They blush and pout and squeal and cry, but Monkey doesn't care,

He makes them walk home naked with their tits and pussies bare."<br>
<br>
Monkey listened to the chanting disappear. He paused, stretched, shook the water out of his hair, and walked into the forest. It wasn't long before he found Jade Flower, hanging from the branch of a tree.<br>
<br>
"Wow, Chang'an girls are pretty gullible," he said, looking up at her. Jade Flower had blundered straight into a rope trap Monkey had set earlier. She hung at around head height, arms bound behind her back, ankles tied together, breasts dangling below her. Her face was very red as she screamed into her gag, making only a muffled hissing sound.<br>
<br>
"It must have been pretty frustrating," Monkey said, picking up a switch and whistling it through the air thoughtfully. "Having to listen to me trick your friends like that, and not being able to stop it. And you know what's even more frustrating?"<br>
<br>
He brought the switch down hard against Jade Flower's nubile upturned buttocks, leaving a neat red stripe across her skin and bringing tears to her eyes as she howled with outrage. Monkey switched her again, and again, enjoying her shrieks of fury and the pretty pattern it made across her body.<br>
<br>
"This!" he said. "All your friends are walking home naked, and you are Monkey's spank toy! How many people will see them, do you think? And how many spanks will you get?"<br>
<br>
And he spanked her again and again, first with the switch and then with the flat of his strong hand, until Jade Flower's pert round bottom glowed a lovely shade of red, and she was beside herself with shame and outrage, screaming insults quite helplessly into her gag as she swayed back and forth in her silken bonds. Monkey leaned back against a tree, admiring her fortitude as she struggled to free herself from the ropes.<br>
<br>
"What a lovely sight you make, Jade Flower," he teased, eyes roving over her nubile figure. "So what if your breasts are a trifle smaller than men really prefer? The ass more than makes up for it, I assure you. And the face isn't so bad, either. Do you think you could make your eyes just a little angrier? Yes, that will do. But one thing is missing."<br>
<br>
"Mmmfff?"<br>
<br>
"Somebody to see!"<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
The bearded merchant from distant Khotan was in a splendid mood as he walked down the road between the lightly forested mountains. He'd just taken an early lunch, or possibly a late breakfast, with two charming fellow merchants and an equally charming naked lady, although her contribution to the conversation had been limited, gagged and bound to a stone post as she was. Though she had squealed most charmingly when he'd pinched her nipple, and the poem written down her lovely body had been of the very first calibre.<br>
<br>
Yes, the day had been pleasant, and it wasn't over yet. For, if his eyes weren't deceiving him - and the bearded man had eyes like a hawk - there was another naked woman up ahead.<br>
<br>
Bound in silken ropes. Kicking and struggling. Hanging from the branch of a tall tree by the side of the road. Pretty face aimed in the direction of Chang'an. Bottom - and a very nice bottom it was, pert and round and peachy and already glowing a lovely shade of red. Dangling at a convenient height. He walked around her, looking at her from every possible angle, noticing that she remained gagged, and allowing her to see him grin.<br>
<br>
Jade Flower tried to say "This is a violation of Heaven's authority! My dignity is not to be trifled with, foolish merchant who most likely trades in dog's noses and shiny rocks! Release me at once, and perhaps I shall be merciful!"<br>
<br>
But instead she said "MMMFFF!". Anyway, the man from Khotan was reading the sign instead of listening. It was an interesting sign. It hung from two wooden clips attacked to Jade Flower's nipples, and it read "Spank toy. Courtesy of Monkey."<br>
<br>
"Interesting," said the bearded men, picking up a switch that had been conveniently left leaning up against the tree, and whistling it through the air thoughtfully, in exactly the way that Monkey had earlier. "Are you a satisfying spank toy? You must be. I have heard tell of Monkey, and he would never be so thoughtless as to provide travelling merchants with a spank toy that did not serve her purpose."<br>
<br>
And he brought the switch down with a resounding THWWIIIPPP that made Jade Flower buck and squeal. Her eyes watered. Her face blazed red. The swaying sign tugged at her nipples, adding to her discomfort.<br>
<br>
"I was supposed to be in Chang'an by this afternoon," said the bearded man, raising the switch again. "But it won't be so bad if I'm late."<br>
<br>
Presently a number of other travellers arrived, and the bearded man obligingly passed the switch around so they could all take turns amusing themselves by punishing Jade Flower's hot red bottom. The proud noblewoman was utterly humiliated, of course. Her bare breasts swayed in the air, her pussy peeped between her silky thighs, and there was nothing she could do to ease the burning in her backside, nor avoid the stinging blows that lashed her skin. Monkey's knots were firm, and all her struggling only served to emphasize her helplessness.<br>
<br>
"Hey," she heard a voice say. "Isn't that Jade Flower?"<br>
<br>
"It certainly is," said another voice. "I know her well."<br>
<br>
Two travelling musicians, their drums and lutes slung over their backs, stood on the grass under the tree, discussing Jade Flower's predicament in wry, amused tones of voice as their lecherous gazes crawled over her skin, drinking in every detail of her lovely nude rope-dimpled figure. "Only last week she had me thrown out of the city for making a racket in the street! Yes, I'd had a few cups of wine, but how else am I expected to relax after a hard day's journey?"<br>
<br>
"These Chang'an noble maidens are the worst," agreed the other musician. "Always making such a fuss, just because the tunes you play outside their windows happen to be a little bawdier than they'd like. But, hark, she's listening."<br>
<br>
"Can you hear us, O fair maiden? Not so arrogant now, are you, dangling here in the nude for our amusement? It transpires that underneath her clothes, the noble Jade Flower is just another squealing ladies' maid, getting her bottom whipped for speaking out of turn."<br>
<br>
"I've a thought," the first musician said, as the switch stung Jade Flower's thighs, making her howl and tremble with fury and frustration. Her eyes watered, her muscles tensed, her dark hair clung to her sweat-slick skin as the cruel cane sent shivers of heat all through her body, and the watching travellers laughed and congratulated each other on a blow well struck. "Let us write a song about it."<br>
<br>
"Ah, of course! A bawdy tavern song about how the foolish, arrogant Jade Flower got tricked out of all her clothes by Monkey, and left stranded as a naked spank toy by the side of the Chang'an road, for the entertainment of all the humble citizens of China. We shall spread her fame far and wide, so all the Middle Kingdom knows the tale, and the name of Jade Flower is indelibly associated with silly girls and hot red naked bottoms."<br>
<br>
"A splendid plan. Let's get to work immediately."<br>
<br>
"Not yet," said the first musician, holding up a hand to thwart her comrade's enthusiasm. "For we have important business, first."<br>
<br>
"How so?" said the second musician, scratching his chin.<br>
<br>
"Do you not see? It is our turn to spank her."<br>
<br>
"Ah," said the second musician, accepting the proffered cane. "You are most wise, my friend."<br>
<br>
"Not at all."<br>
<br>
The shame and indignity of the whole thing made Jade Flower tremble from head to toe. She felt completely mortified, hanging there in the nude with her backside on fire, her pinched nipples protesting, the ropes caressing her skin, the laughter of the filthy commoners ringing in her ears as they stood in a circle around her, mocking and teasing and ogling and making cruel comments about the size of her breasts. She was furious, but Monkey's ropes were stronger than her anger.<br>
<br>
And the spanks just kept coming. Each blow against her bottom a fresh conquest, a stinging shock, reminding her anew of the magnitude of her defeat. The heat lingered on her exposed skin, a fire in her loins that wouldn't stop burning. She was already so sensitive. Yet the disgusting, stupid, dirty, inferior peasants just kept spanking her, again and again, laughing at her discomfort, angling their blows at her tenderest and most vulnerable points.<br>
<br>
She hated being laughed at! She hated it so, so much! She was an important person, a demure and respectable maiden of Chang'an! Nobody was allowed to dishonor her in this appalling way!<br>
<br>
But they did. All day long. And there was nothing Jade Flower could do to stop it. She just had to dangle there, naked and wriggling with shame. Knowing that word of her defeat would spread far and wide, would probably be at the Emperor's court by next morning. And there was nothing she could do about it. Everyone was going to know that Monkey had stripped her and spanked her bottom.

<p id="C3">
Why, hello! It's you again, I see. Come back once more, have you, to the feet of your humble storyteller, there to learn what dreadful sight awaited the princess Tang Ling as she rode through the gates of Chang'an, sword at the ready to swiftly dispatch that wicked scourge of womankind known across all China, and perhaps even the unknown barbarian regions far beyond that mighty kingdom's borders, as Monkey?<br>
<br>
Well, I shan't keep you waiting. The sight in question, you may not be surprised to hear, was women.<br>
<br>
But why should the sight of women appal Tang Ling so, you ask? Surely, being a woman herself, sipping tea in their company, gossiping with them in the halls of the Imperial Capital and training with them on the practice field (for ancient China was home to a great many warrior women, all masters of sword and bow, as the oldest scrolls and legends make perfectly clear), she was accustomed to their presence?<br>
<br>
Why, yes, of course! But, in the ordinary way of things, most of the women that Tang Ling saw had all their clothes on.<br>
<br>
Now, there were exceptions.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, of course, Tang Ling and the ladies of the Emperor's court would retire to the bathhouse, there to relax amid perfumed steam in the secure knowledge that thick stone walls and dozens of heavily armed guards stood between them and the prying eyes of any gentlemen or commoner who happened to fancy a peak at their unclad forms, perfect as lotus blossoms.<br>
<br>
In the countryside, quite naturally, it was her way to bathe in mountain streams, whether alone or in the company of one or two cherished travelling companions - all of the feminine persuasion, of course.<br>
<br>
And from time to time it occurred that a woman would challenge Tang Ling to single combat - whether with the sword or on the chessboard. Tang Ling always won, of course, and in accordance with the ancient custom (a custom even more ancient than ancient China, which makes it pretty ancient), she was well within her rights to impose a forfeit on the defeated maiden.<br>
<br>
In order to teach the maiden humility, Tang Ling generally confiscated her silken robes, and made her swear not to dress again until she had composed a long poem in Tang Ling's honor and read it three times from start to finish in the nearest marketplace. The poem, of course, must describe in detail how excellent Tang Ling was and how foolish the warrior maiden had been to challenge her, with an exhaustive and poetic list of all the weaknesses of character that had led her to believe otherwise.<br>
<br>
Few women challenged Tang Ling twice. Though there was one, a red-headed barbarian from the lands beyond the sunset... but I digress. You wished to know why Tang Ling was shocked by the spectacle of women in Chang'an.<br>
<br>
The question is really very simple. I'm surprised you haven't guessed the answer! What a fool you are. How lucky you have me, to explain such trivial things to you.<br>
<br>
Chang'an is justly famous across China for its beautiful, wise, elegant and, above all, very modest noblewomen. It was these noblewomen Tang Ling saw in the streets of the city. Running errands, buying goods in the market, strolling in small groups down the road, quietly chatting to each other.<br>
<br>
And performing other deeds, as well. Deeds most unbecoming of a noble maiden of Chang'an. Serving in tea houses. Dancing in the streets, to the accompaniment of travelling musicians, with bells around their wrists and ankles, while passing traders chuckled and tossed coins into a waiting wooden ball. Even down on all fours, scrubbing the pavement outside shops, while the grinning owner relaxed with his feet up.<br>
<br>
But what was not what shocked Tang Ling. I mean, it shocked her, but it's not what shocked her the most.<br>
<br>
What shocked her the most, as I'm sure you've guessed, was...<br>
<br>
Should I tell you?<br>
<br>
You really haven't guessed? Go on, take a stab at it. I'll wait. I'm sure you'll get there.<br>
<br>
Oh, yes, well done! That's quite right. How clever of you to come up with it. It just so happened that not a single one of the noble ladies of Chang'an, scurrying around the streets of that bustling, crowded trade hub of a city, at the beck and call of their social inferiors, toiling like common peasants for all the world to see, suffering through the laughter and catcalls and gasps of amazement as thousands of people from every last corner of the globe (for they knew the world was round in ancient China) watched them slave away, had any clothes on at all.<br>
<br>
They were stark naked!<br>
<br>
Every last one of the noble ladies of Chang'an, each one of them more beautiful than the next, except the first one, who was only more beautiful than the last one, had been stripped completely nude. Perhaps only last week they had been smug, sneering, elegant aristocrats, giggling from behind their paper fans at the foolishness of the dirty, uneducated commoners. But today they were slaves, forced to obey the most menial and degrading orders from the lips of those self-same commoners. And not just any slaves.<br>
<br>
Naked slaves!<br>
<br>
To their utter and complete discomfort, chagrin, humiliation and horror. They could hide nothing. Their bottoms wiggling, their tits bouncing, their shoulders and bellies and the backs of their knees gleaming in the sunlight. Their dark hair unbound and flying in the breeze. And their pussies, such wonderful tender rosepetal pussies, thatched with silken curls or clean-shaven and bare. You could, if you so chose, walk down the street, letting your eyes flutter from one perfect pussy to the next, no two exactly alike, and never be disappointed.<br>
<br>
And many did. In fact, the poet Wang Bo had already composed the first three stanzas of his Ode To The Vaginas Of The Ladies Of Chang'An, which in the centuries to come would be justly famed as a classic of Chinese literature, and is how we know exactly what every last one of the women's pussies look like, all these years later.<br>
<br>
Yes, all things considered, the ladies of Chang'an had to agree that letting the whole world see their pussies, and take notes, and discuss their intimate anatomy in detail, was the most abjectly humiliating part of the whole mortifying ordeal.<br>
<br>
But how could this possibly have happened, you demand? Who enslaved these women? Will the brave and very heroic Tang Ling succeed in freeing them, or will she fall into the clutches of the foul tyrant (it was Monkey) who captured and humiliated these unlucky ladies, and suffer the same shameful treatment? Yes, you ask with bated breath... will we get to see Tang Ling's pussy?<br>
<br>
The answer is, yes... eventually. But to find out how, you'll have to listen to the story.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
The noblewomen of Chang'an devised a great many stratagems to get revenge on Monkey.<br>
<br>
First, they hired warriors to slay him. Women warriors, of course, since every man they approached with their tale of woe simply burst into laughter and proclaimed that Monkey had done a splendid thing.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan dispatched her most loyal servants to scour the countryside far and wide, soliciting the aid of the bravest lady soldiers in all the Middle Kingdom. One by one, they travelled to Chang'an. Princess Wing of the Golden Hammer. Lady Hei, Wielder of the Steel Fan. The seven deadly assassins of the Midnight Viper Brigade. One by one, they travelled out into the western mountains, weapons at the ready, seeking Monkey's head.<br>
<br>
One by one they fell into traps. Princess Wing was lured into a mud pit. Lady Hei was locked in a wooden chest full of Mongolian tickle worms. The ladies of the Viper Brigade were deceived into fighting one another, stripping each other's armor off and binding each other with tight silk ropes. One by one they were sent back to Chang'an, hopping or crawling or bound hand and foot, mocking slogans daubed across their bodies. Stark naked, of course.<br>
<br>
The noblewomen of Chang'an were greatly angered by this defeat. But they did not give up, though all the peasants and merchants in the city were greatly amused by their frustration. They turned to the gods for help. Jade Flower led a procession to the temple of the King of Heaven, in the heart of the city, where they burnt an offering of incense and asked the King's statue how Monkey could possibly be sent away.<br>
<br>
The King of Heaven spoke. He told them he had never met eight such beautiful, dignified, intelligent women, and promised to do everything in his power to help them. But he warned that Monkey was a dreadfully powerful creature, with all the strategies of Hell at his command, and that if they did not want to be made his slaves forever, they must do exactly as the King of Heaven said.<br>
<br>
Jade Flower promised she would follow the King's orders exactly, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable the tasks he assigned her might be. Each of the other noblewomen, not wishing to appear cowardly in front of her companions, hurried to make the same commitment.<br>
<br>
"Are you quite sure?" asked the King of Heaven, whose voice, strangely, seemed to be coming from a point just behind the statue's head. "For there is but one way to banish the hideous, ugly, despicable but undeniably cunning demon-beast we know as Monkey, and I am afraid you will not like it. In fact, you will probably be too scared to perform it!"<br>
<br>
"I fear nothing," said Jade Flower. "Send me to wrestle a dozen fiery serpents in the Yangtze River mud, and I shall do it."<br>
<br>
"And I fear even less," said Lin Yan. "Send me to steal the Peaches of Immortality from the gardens of Mount Penglai, and I shall do it."<br>
<br>
The other women joined in, bragging of all the brave deeds they would perform. But still the King of Heaven was sceptical. "I am sure you ladies are most brave," he said. "But I still don't think you're brave enough to do as you must do to banish Monkey."<br>
<br>
"Try us," suggested Lady Meichang.<br>
<br>
"Very well," said the King of Heaven. "The wicked fiend Monkey likes wine, and music, and ripe fruit, and the wind in the bamboo groves on warm summer days, and many other things. But the thing that he likes most is the blush on the face of a naked woman, and the squeal on her lips. If he dedicated all his considerable energy to the warrior's arts, he could make himself Emperor of the World. If he devoted himself to the arts of the scholar, he could achieve immortality, and become one of the Eight Sacred Sages. It is our misfortune that, instead, he chooses pranks."<br>
<br>
"It is indeed a great tragedy for all China that Monkey should waste his time in such a way," agreed Jade Flower. "But tell me, as the undeserving subjects of his attention, how may we divert from from this foolish hobby, and compel him to return to the simple pleasures of wine and ripe fruit?"<br>
<br>
"That is most simple. You must convince him that you are entirely without shame. Otherwise, he will haunt Chang'an for the next ten thousand years, and in all that time not a woman of the city will know peace."<br>
<br>
"But, o great King of Heaven, how do we convince Monkey that we are without shame?"<br>
<br>
"Why, that is very simple. You must perform the most shameful, humiliating, ridiculous acts you can think of, in full view of all the humble denizens of this great city of Chang'an. Word will get to Monkey, and he will conclude there is no point in embarrassing you further."<br>
<br>
"But, o great King of Heaven," said Jade Flower, cheeks already growing a little pink, "will that not be terribly... um, shameful?"<br>
<br>
"See?" said the King of Heaven. "I said you weren't brave enough to do it."<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
The antics of the noblewomen of Chang'an, over the next few weeks, were a source of great merriment to the peasants and merchants, the poets and wine-sellers and gamblers, the pig-keepers and street-sweepers and dressmakers and carpenters and cooks, of that richest and liveliest and most enthusiastic of cities.<br>
<br>
The shame of the ladies was great, but of course they could not doubt the King of Heaven. And so it came to pass that Lady Meichang and her companions paraded their nude bodies through the city's busy streets from sunrise to sunset, handing out flowers and kissing each other on command.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan sang and danced on street corners, silver bells at her wrists and ankles, silver coins clattering in her wooden begging bowl. Jade Flower composed an opera, retelling the whole story of the hot spring and the eight blushing ladies, and starred in a week's worth of free performances.<br>
<br>
Each morning they gathered at the temple to hear the King of Heaven's instructions for the day. And Monkey, hiding just behind the statue's head, gave them the silliest and most ridiculous orders he could think of, in his best King of Heaven voice, while assuring the girls that Monkey would hate seeing them do it. He made them roll naked in the mud, crawl through town barking like a dog, and spank each other's bare bottoms on the temple steps.<br>
<br>
Of course, the eight women wriggled with embarrassment through every single second of it. They were proud aristocrats, not tavern dancing girls! But they sincerely believed that the only way to save the ladies of Chang'an from eternal indignity was to parade their peach-like bottoms, their pert, jaunty breasts, and the dewy-soft tender mysteries concealed between their silky thighs for the entertainment of the public.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan's face was hot with shame, Jade Flower blushed mightily, Lady Meichang squirmed and covered herself as best she could. The peasants, of course, ate it up.<br>
<br>
Finally, once he'd run out of entertaining things to make them do, Monkey commanded the girls to stand in the main square outside the temple, naked, with their eyes closed. He ordered the girls not to open their eyes, not to ask questions, not to resist, come what may. He told them that he, the King of Heaven, had been so impressed by all their courage and hard work, their willingness to do whatever it took to defend the honor of Chang'an's women, that he was going to personally make the long trip down from Heaven to congratulate them, and dispose of that foul brute Monkey for good.<br>
<br>
But, first, he had one last test for them.<br>
<br>
He tied each woman's hands with stiff strong cord to a bamboo pole, driven into the ground behind her. He commanded, in his best King of Heaven voice, that each of the girls do their best to try to wiggle free, and noted with pleasure that they couldn't. Monkey tied strong knots. The eight beautiful young ladies of Chang'an, with their silken hair and lovely pouting faces and full high breasts and warm, inviting pussies, their hot red cheeks, their bodies constructed by the gods to be touched and stroked and kissed, stood with their hands bound in the middle of the busiest thoroughfare in all the city. Quite unable to escape.<br>
<br>
And once Monkey was sure the girls were thoroughly trapped, once he had proven to his own satisfaction that nothing under Heaven beside his own good graces could free them from this most humiliating predicament, he bid them open their eyes.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan opened her eyes. She saw Monkey, sitting in front of her, smiling. "Hello," he said, still in his best King of Heaven voice.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan opened her mouth, then closed it again. Overcome by a sudden, crushing awareness of just how foolish she had been. She looked at the crowd of peasants and merchants standing behind Monkey, blinked, and said "EEEEEEEEK STOP LOOKING STOP LOOKING STOOOOOP!"<br>
<br>
"Ha ha!" said Monkey, as the eight naked and very gullible-feeling ladies stood in a row in the middle of Chang'an, squealing and whining and squirming and wriggling for all they were worth, the laughter of the crowd ringing in their ears, thousands of lower-class eyes drinking in every lovely inch of their nubile, shivering flesh. "I tricked you!"<br>
<br>
And so he had. But it was far too late for the noblewomen to do anything about it! Their faces burnt with shame and fury as they stood before the mocking crowd, bare from head to toe, taunts and jibes ringing in their ears.<br>
<br>
Monkey had more tortures in store for them, of course. He tweaked each girl's nipples, ruffled her hair, pinched her bottom and made rude comments about the size of her breasts. He strolled from one to the other, assessing her body in detail, giving his feedback out loud, and writing his compliments across her naked skin in beautiful calligraphy. The brush tickled enormously, and the girls complained, but they couldn't get away.<br>
<br>
"Now," he said, stepping back and admiring his handiwork, "I shall leave you to the mercy of the public."<br>
<br>
Lin Yan took a look at the mob of filthy, grubby, rough-handed, coarse-minded peasants currently ogling her, and gulped. "No, Monkey," she begged. "Please don't do that."<br>
<br>
"But, my lady, what can you be afraid of? Surely the aristocrats of China are the wisest and most benevolent of sovereigns. The people must love you. I expect that if I leave the scene, they will shortly untie you, provide you with clothing and restore you to your accustomed position of authority."<br>
<br>
"Um," said Lin Yan, thinking of all the time she had whipped the bottom of her chambermaid for leaving a single seed in her morning persimmon, or enforced an imperial decree that every woman in a disobedient province should be obliged to go without undergarments for a year and a day. "Sadly, the common folk do not always understand what is good for them."<br>
<br>
"You wish me to stay?"<br>
<br>
"If you would be most kind."<br>
<br>
"Then I will stay," said Monkey, and his smile grew very wide. "On one condition. You and all the other noblewomen of Chang'an will elect me King of the City, and serve me loyally, until such time as I tire of the job."<br>
<br>
"How long would that take, do you think?"<br>
<br>
"I get bored easily. I am Monkey! Can you truly imagine me on a throne? I am sure that after a few days, the crowd will grow heavy on my head."<br>
<br>
"But, Monkey, what would you do in those few days?"<br>
<br>
"You ask a lot of questions for a girl tied to a pole. Perhaps I shall take my leave, after all." He made to go, and was stopped in his tracks by a wailed chorus of "Stay! Stay!"<br>
<br>
"You will make me King, then?" he said, with an even wider smile.<br>
<br>
Lin Yan looked at the waiting crowd, and gulped. "Yes," she said, in a very small voice. "You can be King."<br>
<br>
"Excellent! But what should be my first decree as King? I have never ruled a city before, and I must confess myself at a loss. Might I ask your advice, Lin Yan?"<br>
<br>
"Let us go."<br>
<br>
"An interesting concept. Jade Flower, any suggestions?"<br>
<br>
"Give us clothes! Please! Make them stop looking!"<br>
<br>
"An idea with many merits. Lady Meichang, might I benefit from your wisdom?"<br>
<br>
"Eeek! They're all laughing at me! Quick! Untie me, please!"<br>
<br>
"I shall reflect upon it," said Monkey, gravely. "Ladies, you have given me a lot to think about, and for that I thank you. Clearly, the governance of Chang'an is a most studious burden, not to be taken lightly. I must retire to my chambers for the remainder of the morning, to contemplate my newfound responsibilities."<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
"Don't leave us here!"<br>
<br>
"No!"<br>
<br>
But retire Monkey did, abandoning the girls to their fate. All they could do was stand there, squirming, as the leering peasant mob converged on them, intent on subjecting them to the utmost shame and indignity. Lin Yan looked into the eyes of half a dozen grinning chambermaids, each one bearing a willow switch, and gulped.<br>
<br>
And it thus came to pass that the eight beautiful noblewomen of Chang'an were tickled, fondled and groped silly by all the leering peasants, then paraded nude around the city in a condition of shameful spanked defeat, with their cheeks afire and their well-switched bottoms glowing bright red. And everyone made fun of them for being so gullible, and threw overripe fruit at them, and composed songs and stories in honor of their shame. And their bottoms were spanked some more, and their nipples and pussies were tickled by chambermaids with long peacock feathers, and they were made to publicly confess before a laughing mob that they were the silliest, naughtiest, most easily tricked girls in the world.

<p id="C4">
"I see," said Tang Ling, noblest princess in all of ancient China. "That's how it happened."<br>
<br>
"Indeed," said Monkey, sitting on a carved wooden throne in the finest room of Chang'an's most extravagant palace. "That's how I became King of Chang'an."<br>
<br>
Tang Ling scowled. Everywhere she looked, her eyes fell on the silken, peach-plump figures of mortified, wriggling naked girls. Some were on their hands and knees, polishing the floors. Some were trapped in cages. Some were serving platters of fruit to Monkey's delighted guests, reluctantly dancing to music, or bent over the laps of amused chambermaids, squealing adorably as their bottoms were spanked bright pink.<br>
<br>
Monkey had decreed, of course, in his infinite wisdom, that every last noble female in all Chang'an was to be stripped completely naked and converted into a blushing slave-girl for the entertainment of the city's common folk. Such would be their fate so long as he stayed king.<br>
<br>
Welcome back, by the way. I've missed you.<br>
<br>
"Despicable creature," snapped Tang Ling, brandishing her sword. "Your foul deeds fly in the face of Heaven! I demand you cede to me your ill-gotten authority at once!"<br>
<br>
"But, fair Tang Ling, she whose beauty far outshines even these lovely maidens who toil at my pleasure, I won my position fair and square. The noble ladies of Chang'an were well within their rights to nominate me as their king."<br>
<br>
"Trickery and deception! To impersonate the King of Heaven is not the least of your crimes. Step down at once, fiend, or it shall not go easy for you."<br>
<br>
"Careful," said Monkey, raising himself from his throne and drawing himself up to his full height. He was considerably shorter than Tang Ling. "You are renowned for your swordplay, Tang Ling. From the northern plains to the southern jungles, from the eastern mountains to the western seas, you are universally considered to be the single most deadly warrior in all China. But I have at my disposal a defensive technique the likes of which even you have never seen."<br>
<br>
"Is that so?"<br>
<br>
"It is," said Monkey, and then he turned tail and ran away.<br>
<br>
Tang Ling gave chase. She pursued Monkey for no less than one hundred days and nights, through the streets of Chang'an, through the mountains of Tibet, through the Taklamakan desert and all the way back down the course of the muddy Yellow River. She chased him across the sea to the barbarian kingdom of Wa, to the pirate-haunted island of Formosa and the thousand bays of the southern coast. She tracked him through thick bamboo forests, across boundless wastes of sand and the rolling waves themselves.<br>
<br>
Finally, she caught up to him. "Monkey," she said. "You can run no further, and I have barely started. Surrender, and I'll not chop off your head."<br>
<br>
"I... can... still... run..." said Monkey, wheezing and panting theatrically. Tang Ling approached, her guard up, and dodged a flurry of blows from a pathetic little dagger no longer than a chopstick. She knocked Monkey's blade aside with ease, observing that even the fiercest of his blows had failed to so much as touch her skin.<br>
<br>
"Run, then," she said.<br>
<br>
Monkey took a faltering step backward, fear etched on his handsome face, and collapsed into a mud puddle. Tang Ling stood over him, scorn radiating from her fierce eyes, her contempt visible in every line of her strong, lithe, silk-clad figure.<br>
<br>
"And now," she said. "You will come with me, to the top of Mount Kunlun, where the Jade Emperor awaits on his Heavenly Throne. I will present you for judgment before all of China's 888,888 gods and immortals, and they will decide upon your punishment."<br>
<br>
"Oh, no," said Monkey, shrinking away from the point of Tang Ling's sword. "I don't wish to be exhibited on display before all of China's 888,888 gods and immortals, captured and helpless, like some common beast. Oh, the shame of it!"<br>
<br>
"Monkey, what a fool you are. You did not hesitate to exhibit the hapless womenfolk of Chang'an in a state of shameful nudity before the denizens of the marketplace. Why, then, should I grant you mercy? You shall be exhibited before the assembled multitudes of Heaven as the petty, stupid, easily defeated thing you are."<br>
<br>
"No! Please, anything but that!" cried Monkey, grabbing at the hem of Tang Ling's robe. "It's too humiliating! I can't bear it!"<br>
<br>
"A humiliation well deserved," snapped Tang Ling, already thinking about the splendid reward the gods would grant her for ridding China of such a pest. "No more complaining! To Kunlun we go!"<br>
<br>
And she leaped in a direction that only gods and heroes know, taking her directly to the top of Mount Kunlun. "Greetings," she said, to the thousand-headed serpent who guard the gates of the Celestial City. "I come bearing a gift for the Jade Emperor."<br>
<br>
"Sssss," said the serpent, speaking through a thousand mouths at once. "Welcome back, Tang Ling, finest and most beautiful warrior in all of China. Go right in."<br>
<br>
And in Tang Ling strode, dragging Monkey behind her on a chain. She marched through the jade-paved streets of the Celestial City, through the enamelled gates of the Imperial Palace, and right into the audience hall of the Jade Emperor, where he waited for her on his heavenly throne. She came to a stop before him, and bowed so deep her head touched the floor.<br>
<br>
"You may rise," said the Jade Emperor. He was impossibly handsome, ancient and wise. His beard was so long it touched the floor, and his divine form was clad in robes of an impossible splendiferousness. "What have you brought us, o Tang Ling?"<br>
<br>
Tang Ling looked to her right, then to her left, at the walls of the empty hall. "If it please you, o August One," she said, "I would have all of Heaven bear witness to my deed today."<br>
<br>
The Jade Emperor clapped his hands. Instantly the 888,888 gods and immortals of China were assembled in his audience hall, jostling each other to get a better view of the soldier princess. Now Tang Ling's eyes passed across mountain nymphs, coiling dragons, yellow and red gnomes, bickering fox-women, petty gods of salt and silk and pottery and roads. The Queen of Heaven nudged the Great Lady of the West and said "This had better be good."<br>
<br>
For a moment, Tang Ling paused. There was a little twinge of hesitation in the back of her mind. A nagging sense that she'd overlooked something.<br>
<br>
But the moment passed. "Gods and goddesses," she said, beaming with pride. "Immortals, scholars, sages, ancient creatures of the sky and earth. I, Tang Ling, have performed a remarkable deed. I have captured Monkey!"<br>
<br>
For a moment, there was silence. Then the Jade Emperor stroked his august beard, raised one perfect eyebrow and said "Remarkable, if true."<br>
<br>
"It is true."<br>
<br>
"You know, do you not, that Monkey is the lord of trickery? And that he has never been successfully captured before, though many have tried?"<br>
<br>
"I do."<br>
<br>
"You know the tale," said the Jade Emperor, "of how Monkey stole the silk robe of the Weaver Goddess, as she bathed in the River of Stars? And she could not retrieve it, though she chased him from one end of the cosmos to the other?"<br>
<br>
"I do."<br>
<br>
"A most difficult trial for the Weaver Goddess, who may only wear robes spun from the silk of one particular silkworm, who lives in a cave at the distant eastern end of the earth. He produces but one thread of silk a year, and only when fed on the fruit of one particular mulberry tree, which grows on an island at the distant western end of the earth. So the Weaver Goddess had to spend the next ten thousand years naked, carrying mulberries from one end of the earth to the other."<br>
<br>
"And when she finally had a brand new robe, Monkey stole it again," said Tang Ling, a little impatiently. "Yes, I know the tale. But I have done what the Weaver Goddess could not?"<br>
<br>
"You deem yourself wiser than the gods, Tang Ling?"<br>
<br>
"Not all the gods, o August One, I promise you. But the fact remains," said Tang Ling with a shrug, "I have captured Monkey, and they haven't."<br>
<br>
"Indeed," said the Jade Emperor. "Wiser than the Queen of Heaven? For well do I recall the day when Monkey trapped her inside that hollow log and conjured two strong-handed ogres to turn her backside red."<br>
<br>
"I suppose then, I must be wiser than her."<br>
<br>
"And wiser than the Great Lady of the West? For all of us remember the evening Monkey trapped her in a sack, by promising her there was gold at the bottom, and left her there for three nights and three days with only a few hundred Mongolian tickle worms for company."<br>
<br>
"Then I must be wiser than her, as well."<br>
<br>
"And are you wiser than the nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine nymphs of the western mountains. For you must know how Monkey posed as a doctor and convinced every last nymph that she could learn to fly if she kissed the tip of his... well, never mind."<br>
<br>
"I am sure," said Tang Ling, rolling her eyes, "that I'm wiser than a bunch of nymphs. Why not cut to the chase, o August One? I am willing to declare, in your presence, that I am wiser than every last god and immortal in this room - saving only yourself, of course."<br>
<br>
"Is that so? Then let's hear it."<br>
<br>
"Fine," said Tang Ling, drawing herself up to her full height, standing proudly in the center of the vast audience chamber. The eyes of all 888,888 gods and immortals, the most august personages of Heaven and the most powerful and important beings in the Universe, were all fixed on her. Right now, in her silk robes, her exquisite beauty and radiant wisdom shining forth, she felt like she was a match for any of them."<br>
<br>
"I, Tang Ling," she said, for all to hear, "am the wisest, smartest, strongest bravest, boldest, quickest, brightest, kindest and most beautiful princess in all China! And, yes. I am wiser than the gods!"<br>
<br>
There was a soft rustling sound, and all her clothes fell off.<br>
<br>
Leaving her naked. Every inch of her soft silky skin, from her rosy cheeks to the tips of her cute little toes, from her small, high, exquisitely formed breasts to her pert round bottom and the silken delta between her wonderfully soft thighs, utterly exposed. Her lovely form a symphony in feminine grace, every part of it arranged in perfect harmony and proportion. With a soft pop her hairband snapped, and her long dark luscious hair flowed gracefully down over her bare back.<br>
<br>
She was naked.<br>
<br>
Stark naked. Absolutely, completely naked.<br>
<br>
In front of all the gods.<br>
<br>
Who all instantly burst into laughter as Monkey stood up, somehow free from his chains, and took a bow. "But not," he said, "wiser than Monkey."<br>
<br>
Tang Ling's shame was so great that it imprisoned her. She was conscious of nothing but oceanic, boiling embarrassment, a paralyzing heat that swept over her body from head to toe. The facts - that Monkey had sabotaged her clothing with his pathetic failed dagger attack, that everything he'd done in the last several weeks had been leading up to this one priceless moment, that he'd played her like a lute from the beginning, that she'd walked like a fool right into his trap - swept across her mind and were gone, drowned in the red tide of humiliation.<br>
<br>
"Ha!" cried the Jade Emperor, tears of laughter streaming down his face. "What a jest, Monkey! Beyond price!"<br>
<br>
And Tang Ling stood naked in the middle of the Jade Emperor's audience hall, in the Celestial City atop Mount Kunlun, surrounded by 888,888 gods and immortals, all of them laughing at her. Nipples and pussy and bottom on display. Pretty face glowing luminously red. Looking right at the Jade Emperor, the most important being in the universe, while he shamelessly ogled her nude body and laughed hysterically at her plight.<br>
<br>
She was, as of that exact moment, the single most embarrassed being in the entire history of the universe. The nakedest, most exposed, most utterly defeated and humiliated woman of all time.<br>
<br>
The gods laughed at her.<br>
<br>
And laughed. And laughed. And laughed.<br>
<br>
For when gods laugh, they don't stop. They don't operate on the same scale of time as you or I. In fact, gods and immortals are perfectly capable of laughing at an embarrassed naked woman for ten thousand years, or even more.<br>
<br>
And in all that time, the embarrassment never stops. Or weakens, even by the tiniest amount. In fact, it gets worse. Every second of every day of every month of every year, the utter blushing squirming red-faced humiliation of standing stark naked in front of all the gods gets just a little bit more excruciatingly shameful and squirmy. There's no boredom, no sleepiness, no getting used to it or wanting to move on. There is only the blush. Ten thousand years, or possibly more, of the blush.<br>
<br>
"Ah," said the Jade Emperor, wiping a tear from his eye as the laughter finally died down. "I needed that."<br>
<br>
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!" howled Tang Ling, and promptly dropped into a crouch, covering her nubile body with arms and knees as best she could. "DON'T LOOK AT MEEEEEE!" It was too late, of course. They had seen everything.<br>
<br>
Monkey coughed, discreetly.<br>
<br>
"May I make one request?" he said.<br>
<br>
"You may," said the Jade Emperor. "Out of respect for the wonderful trick you've played today. This really was very funny, you know."<br>
<br>
"I know, o August One."<br>
<br>
"There she was, all confident, and the next minute - whoosh! All her clothes gone. Marvellous stuff."<br>
<br>
"I thank you most exceedingly, o August One."<br>
<br>
"You are welcome," said the Jade Emperor, grandly. "And nice little breasts she had, too. Anyway, Monkey, what is your request?"<br>
<br>
"My request," said Monkey, "is this. Give Tang Ling her clothes back, and let her walk free."<br>
<br>
There was total silence in the hall, broken only by the Jade Emperor scratching his chin contemplatively. "Hmm," he said, at long last. "An interesting prospect. I have one question for you, Monkey. Why do you request this?"<br>
<br>
"I am nothing if not a merciful creature," explained Monkey. "It occurred to me that Tang Ling's arrogance might have offended you. After all, the princess did declare in your presence that she was wiser than all the gods."<br>
<br>
"Not all the gods," objected Tang Ling, hotly, from her half-crouched position on the floor, but the Jade Emperor silenced her with a wave of his hand. "In truth," he said, "I had not yet decided upon Tang Ling's fate. What cruel destiny did you seek to spare her from?"<br>
<br>
"It occurred to me," said Monkey, "that you might well decide to embarrass Tang Ling so thoroughly that no other princess would ever dare challenge the gods again. In your infinite wisdom, o August One, you could devise a punishment so toe-curlingly shameful that the humblest insect in all China would feel empowered to chuckle at her plight."<br>
<br>
"So I could," said the Jade Emperor, thoughtfully, as Tang Ling opened her mouth to protest and was cut off by another hand wave before she could get a word out. "What punishment, precisely, did you think I might come up with?"<br>
<br>
"That is entirely up to you, o August One. I would never dare to trespass on your divine authority. Of course..."<br>
<br>
"Yes?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, but I do not like to say it. All men know that Tang Ling is the greatest warrior, the wisest scholar and the loveliest princess in China. It offends my sense of propriety, o August One, that the world should see her shamed."<br>
<br>
"Ape, I command you speak."<br>
<br>
"I tremble and obey," said Monkey, dropping to his knees and kowtowing a hundred times before the Jade Emperor. "First, then, o August One, it crossed my mind that you might give Tang Ling into my care, and command me to parade her naked across China."<br>
<br>
Tang Ling's inarticulate squeal was drowned out by the massive rumble of the Jade Emperor's chuckle. "A most amusing concept," he said. "Would you take good care of her, Monkey?"<br>
<br>
"I would keep her on a leash, o August One, and make her dance for our supper in village squares, and kowtow in the mud of the rice-paddies before the humblest peasants. All in accordance with your whims, of course."<br>
<br>
"It does seem an apt punishment," said the Jade Emperor. Monkey cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
"And then," he said, "I would hand her over to the 888,888 gods and immortals of China, each in turn, to do as they will with. After all, it is them she has offended."<br>
<br>
"Can't you see what he's doing?" cried Tang Ling, springing to her feet as the gods around her whistled and eyed her lasciviously. The Great Lady of the West let her gaze travel all up and down Tang Ling's tall, slender body, liking everything she saw. The mountain nymphs giggled, the dragons puffed smoke, the red and yellow gnomes high-fived. "He's trying to mmfff."<br>
<br>
At the Jade Emperor's gesture, a cloth gag appeared in her mouth, cutting her off. Tang Ling's eyes went wide with fury, and she did her best to tug the gag free, exposing her small but lovely breasts, her pert pink nipples like the freshest, ripest cherries and the neatly groomed triangle of black silky hair between her supple thighs. The knot had been tied by a god, of course, and was unbreakable. "Mmffff," she howled into the silk, and Monkey shrugged.<br>
<br>
"Of course," he said, "I myself would never inflict such a wicked fate on a woman. But I am but a humble, stupid ape, o August One, and my judgment is no more than a puddle compared to the oceanic depth of your wisdom."<br>
<br>
"Indeed," said the Jade Emperor, thoughtfully, stroking his beard. "Yes, Monkey, I'm afraid I must deny your request. She did insult the gods, after all."<br>
<br>
"MMMMMMFFFFFFFF!"<br>
<br>
"That she did, o August One."<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
It was some time later.<br>
<br>
Dawn was breaking over the Celestial City. Birdsong rang in the ears of the Queen of Heaven. She half-opened her eyes, catching the glimmer of sunlight.<br>
<br>
What had happened yesterday?<br>
<br>
Oh, yes. All that business with Monkey and the princess. Monkey had wanted to leave right away, but the 888,888 gods and immortals of ancient China had insisted on holding a banquet in his honor. All night long it had lasted, with roast duck and plum wine and moon cakes and seven thousand kinds of soup. What a spanking the red and yellow dwarves had given Tang Ling for spilling their drinks! She made a much better soldier than she did a serving-wench.<br>
<br>
And then what had happened?<br>
<br>
The plum wine had flowed freely. The Queen of Heaven could only just remember making some kind of plan with the Great Lady of the West. Now what had they been about to do?<br>
<br>
Oh, yes. Seduce Monkey, get him alone in a bedroom, take all his clothes off and tie him naked to one of the great jade pillars that framed the gates of the Celestial City. Use the Weaver Goddess' special century rope, so he would have to spend a hundred years up there naked for all the thousands and thousands of pilgrims who visited the city every single day to see.<br>
<br>
Yes, that had been the plan. The Queen of Heaven felt a half-smile come to her lips, thinking about it. Many cycles of the universe had passed since the incident of the hollow log and the two strong-handed ogres, but goddesses are proud creatures, and they never forget an insult.<br>
<br>
She and the Lady of the West had it all figured out. They were going to exhaust Monkey with their combined sexual prowess, use every trick they knew to drain him of his energy, and wait until he fell asleep. Only then would they strike.<br>
<br>
Had it worked?<br>
<br>
Or had Monkey lasted far longer than they expected, exhausting them both with a repertoire of bedroom techniques far beyond anything they could have imagined? Who had fallen asleep first?<br>
<br>
The Queen of Heaven opened her eyes.<br>
<br>
She looked down upon a sea of people. Grinning pilgrims from every corner of China. Barefooted peasants, monks in orange robes, merchants in veils, soldiers in clanking armor. All of them come to pay their respects to the Celestial City, where dwelt the mightiest of the gods.<br>
<br>
All of them looking up at her.<br>
<br>
She hung in the air, bound securely to the side of the imposing jade pillar. Arms raised, legs spread, both fixed in place. The cool mountain air kissing her full breasts, her round hips, the heavenly lotus flower of her naked sex. Monkey had shaved her pussy while she slept, and thousands of eyes were fixed directly on her inviting, slightly parted lower lips.<br>
<br>
The Queen of Heaven's eyes shot wide open.<br>
<br>
"GET ME DOWN," she tried to squeal, but all that came out through her silken gag was "MMMFFF!" Had she been able to issue the command, the pilgrims would have rushed to obey. But she wasn't, so they didn't. Instead, they burst in to howls of ribald laughter, and the more adventurous among them began to pelt her with overripe fruit.<br>
<br>
Monkey, several miles down the track, pricked up his ears at the sound of her inarticulate squeals of rage. "Ha!" he chuckled. "Serves them right."<br>
<br>
"I despise you," offered Tang Ling, picking her way daintily between the scattered boulders. Monkey had given her a pair of boots to wear, but nothing else. He stepped up behind her, made her squawk with a confident slap on the bottom, and said "Serves you right, too."<br>
<br>
"One day, Monkey, all the women of China will gather to destroy you."<br>
<br>
"Excellent," said Monkey. "On that day, then, I shall have the pleasure of stripping naked all the women of China, and making you admit that one cheeky monkey is smarter and quicker than the entire female sex. Now, onward. Chang'an awaits!"<br>
<br>
He slapped her bottom again. Then he went to fetch a switch. Tang Ling gritted her teeth, but there was nothing she could do to stop him whipping her all the way down the mountainside, leaving thin red stripes on her peachy backside all the way. The Emperor of the Universe had decreed that this was her fate.<br>
<br>
"You know," he said, conversationally, "if you weren't so gullible, none of this would have happened."<br>
<br>
"Shut up!"<br>
<br>
But it was true. And poor Tang Ling had to walk naked all the way back to Chang'an, and to parts further beyond. She grovelled before peasants in humble fishing villages along the muddy banks of the Yangtze, and wiggled her tits for the entertainment of sailors in bustling port cities along the southern coast. She was forced to stand nude before every bandit and pirate and demon she had ever defeated in combat, and beg their forgiveness for her insolence. Monkey never ceased to invent new ways to tease her, and she was famous across China as the naked blushing princess before her journey was halfway done.<br>
<br>
But what about the eight noble ladies of Chang'an?<br>
<br>
Lin Yan and Jade Flower and Lady Meichang and all the rest of the noblewomen had put their clothes back on, of course, as soon as Monkey left the city. The eight ladies wanted nothing more than to forget the whole sordid saga. They even passed a law decreeing that nobody in Chang'an was permitted to mention the time that the entire female aristocracy of the city were turned into naked slaves. And they had the bare bottoms of every chambermaid in the city very thoroughly whipped, to remind them of their place.<br>
<br>
But fate was not on their side. The Jade Emperor, inspired by Monkey's deeds, placed a curse on the city in retaliation for their role in Tang Ling's blasphemy against the gods. He decreed that the women of Chang'an should blush eternally. As long as the city stood, its famously attractive womenfolk would always have a tendency to find themselves in compromising, embarrassing, naked situations.<br>
<br>
So Lin Yan's robes blew off in the marketplace. Jade Flower's resentful chambermaids ambushed her in her bath-house and threw her naked into the street. Lady Meichang lost a wager on a game of fan-tan and had to dance naked in the marketplace, singing a song about how silly she was. And all the lovely maidens of Chang'an were kept blushingly naked, showing off their lovely breasts and bottoms and pussies, with faces glowing red while everyone pointed and laughed and teased them about how naked they were, until the end of time.<br>
<br>
Much to their embarrassment.<br>
<br>
But they deserved it. After all, the Jade Emperor can't be wrong.<br>
<br>
The Queen of Heaven and the Great Lady of the West had a very embarrassing hundred years, bound naked with their legs spread before the gates of the Celestial City for all the pilgrims to see. As for Tang Ling, she was taken up into Heaven after her chastisement at the hands of the 888,888 gods and immortals, and made an immortal herself.<br>
<br>
And Monkey spent the rest of eternity stealing her clothes from the bath, hiding Mongolian tickle worms in her undergarments, leaving her tied up naked in public places, and generally subjecting her to the most ingenious and humiliating pranks his subtle mind could device. Eventually, Tang Ling had enough of it, and rallied every last women in China to destroy Monkey, or at least pull his pants down.<br>
<br>
Monkey stripped them all naked as well, of course, and built a human pyramid of shame-faced naked ladies that stretched all the way to the moon. Then he carried out his famous assault on the fortress of the Moon Witch. But that's another story.
