"Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee;<br>
<br>
As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be<br>
<br>
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use<br>
<br>
Are like Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views..."<br>
<br>
— John Donne, To His Mistress Going to Bed<br>
<br>
From an early age I had a serious crush on my next-door neighbor. Almost three years older than me, Laura was and is gorgeous — brunette, with warm hazel eyes and a fine figure, slim and shapely. In addition to her exquisite looks, Laura was and is clever and strong-willed, an energetic high achiever. At school she threw herself into just about everything. She joined clubs, served on the student council, won academic prizes and athletic honours. She was also a thrill-seeker. Despite her diminutive stature she was tough and utterly fearless, engaged in sports such as mountain-biking and rock-climbing. Yet she was also incredibly sexy. When not acting the tomboy she reveled in being a girl. She was proud of her body and legs, which she liked to show off in short skirts, snug-fitting tops and barely-there bikinis; but not in a vain or wanton manner. Laura was a flirt but never a tease, nor a prima donna.<br>
<br>
I don't know if she consciously played on the juxtaposition of pretty and petite with the difficult and dangerous, but the contrast could be striking. For example, when she was sixteen she won a junior motocross championship, against boys as well as girls. She was the smallest rider in the field and prevailed by sheer daring and determination. She sauntered off the track looking triumphant in her mud-spattered leathers, high-fiving her friends and fans, reeking of fuel and exhaust fumes, her dirt-caked face barely recognizable but for the patented Laura grin — outwardly modest but betraying at the edges her sublime self-confidence. Yet a few hours later she turned out for the awards ceremony completely transformed, prodigiously feminine in a little pink party dress. I was thirteen at the time, and while my infatuation was already well-developed, that was what pushed me into straight-out idolatry.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, Laura was the most popular girl in the neighborhood, exacerbating the anguish of my unrequited crush. In high school she was attended by a retinue of admirers and acolytes. She went through several boyfriends and the occasional girlfriend. Her preference was only slightly biased in one direction. What was most demoralizing for me, however, was that when word got out that we were close, I was besieged by potential suitors seeking an introduction or hoping for a recommendation.<br>
<br>
Of course, I never expected for myself anything more than platonic. Besides our age difference and dissimilar natures, almost diametrical opposites in many aspects, because neither of us have siblings we developed a surrogate big sister—little brother relationship which ruled out anything more intimate.<br>
<br>
Naturally Laura had flaws. She could be stubborn and at times dogmatic, most often about trivial things. She could be bossy, although she would call it assertive. She was intolerant towards people she judged to be stupid; and even if they were, she could come across as arrogant. She was fully aware of her charm and charisma, and would act abrupt and sometimes cruel towards devotees who overreached themselves. But it was impossible to disparage her, because everything she did was done with style. And that came out in the fact that although she must have known of my feelings for her — I was not very subtle — she never made a big thing of it, nor had me feeling awkward.<br>
<br>
So when she went off to university, it was something of a relief for me. I was finally freed from the torments of Tantalus. I had long since abandoned any thoughts of entering the temple of Laura.<br>
<br>
For the next three years I saw Laura in person only intermittently. She had lived with her mother since her parents' divorce. They didn't get on and Laura rarely came home. But we kept in touch. I think I may have been her anchor; so maybe she was not as fancy-free as she pretended. In any case, I followed her to the university three years later — not in a stalkery way, although we ended up living in the same student accommodation.<br>
<br>
Nestled amongst the trees in a quiet corner of the campus, Lakeside Hall is in actuality five multi-storey apartment blocks connected by covered walkways. Four are mixed-sex dormitories housing both undergraduates and postgraduates in twin-share suites. The fifth wing accommodates first-year students, with males and females occupying alternate floors in four-bed units. Altogether Lakeside has four hundred residents, of whom just over three-fifths are women, which mirrors the university's population.<br>
<br>
When I applied for admission Laura didn't mock my choice and in fact helped me through the process. This was vital because Lakeside is rather selective. What sets it apart from other residential colleges is not just its secluded location but the fact that it's fully autonomous, and organized on a self-help basis. There are no full-time paid staff. All residents are rostered for catering and housekeeping duties. The seniors also provide peer support, mentoring and tutoring. This collaborative philosophy extends to governance. All internal affairs are managed by an elected house committee. There's a manager and a proctor, but they are essentially honorary officers with only nominal responsibilities. Most importantly, fees and charges are very low. And all this is possible because Lakeside is independently funded by a network of alumni and "friends". One of the benefits of this system is that there is no strong imperative for residents to hold down an outside job. This allows more time and energy for academic, social and cultural activities.<br>
<br>
My interview for admission went smoothly and I settled in quickly. My roommates were typical of what you find among freshmen from out of town. There were only three of us because the fourth hadn't turned up. Ricardo was the popular kid in high school who struggled to cope when he transitioned to the much bigger arena of the university. But he sought solace in varsity sport and found his niche. Ben was a scruffy, indolent rapscallion whose attitude was to study just enough to pass. His major saving grace was his sister Emily. A third-year student, she doted on her brother more than he deserved. At our first encounter she was wearing a candy-striped, strapless playsuit; and it was impossible not to be smitten by the transcendent vision of honey-blond hair, sapphire-blue eyes, lustrous legs and delectable décolletage. But she had a gentle soul, was unworldly and intellectual, and did not seem aware of her own resplendence.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I'd met Caitlyn. She was a "townie", a local girl living on-campus. There were lots of these at Lakeside, more than at most of the university's residential houses. She was a second-year student; but we were enrolled in a similar course, the history and philosophy of science, and became study buddies. We complemented each other, having our particular academic strengths and interests. She was quiet and sweet-natured, with brown hair and eyes, a cute flush of freckles and an endearing way of tilting her head during a conversation, as if showing a sense of ease or trying to get a different view — it was hard to say which, perhaps both. Gradually a closer bond developed.<br>
<br>
We celebrated Caitlyn's birthday on the weekend before Easter by visiting her parents. I didn't ask why she wasn't living with them. But there was something oddly appealing, almost seductive, about life at Lakeside Hall. I mean odd because as soon as you arrive it's like your senses tingle. There's an aura of mystery, secrecy even, as if something is going on beneath the surface or behind the curtains. And it's easy to attribute this to the relative isolation and the brooding eminence of the surrounding, dense woods, which are positively spooky at night. But even before I arrived I knew of its unorthodox reputation; even if actual claims about what went on there were always vague. The legends of debauchery and diabolism could be dispelled by a brief tour.<br>
<br>
Still, I am reminded of Plato's famous allegory of the cave. For people trapped within, their only glimpse of the reality outside consists of shadows moving on the walls.<br>
<br>
As the year progressed, the shadows came into sharper focus. But life at Lakeside for the first three months was comfortably mundane. I quickly settled into the routine of university life. I enjoyed my classes and did well in all my subjects. There was less pressure than in high school! Almost before I knew it the first semester was coming to a close.<br>
<br>
Confounding my initial reservations, the Hall proved an excellent environment both educationally and socially. However, I was mostly content to hang out on the fringes of other people's social circles. Neither a hermit nor an outcaste, I have nonetheless never been good at, or for that matter interested in, having my own clique or coterie.<br>
<br>
Laura continued to act as my guide and guru, although I tried to be not too dependent on her. That was not just out of pride. She had her own, crowded life. She had no permanent romantic attachments that I knew of, yet was as popular as she'd ever been. Those friends of hers I met were very much her personality types — adventurous, impulsive, unconventional. Not surprisingly, she was a member of a women's "adventure club". Guys joined in their activities, but I was not invited. Yet I didn't feel slighted. I had no interest since my pastimes have always tended to the sedentary. Which doesn't mean I'm a wimp or a faint-heart. It was just that I subscribe to the theory that you're allotted only so many heartbeats in your lifetime, and it's illogical to use them up before you have to. Still, as a result I began to see less of Laura as the semester progressed.<br>
<br>
I got most advice and assistance from Rachel, a second-year student. She was very attractive, like Laura, with lively, olive-green eyes, auburn hair and an enigmatic smile. She had a keen intellect and a sharp, rather acerbic wit, but was passionate once she'd found a cause worthy of her time and effort. She was the sophomore counsellor in my "tute group". These were mentoring groups, each consisting of half a dozen first-year students with a senior tutor and a sophomore assistant. They helped us newbies on issues involving the transition from school to university.<br>
<br>
There was just the one other guy in the group, and that was Ben. Whereas he and I were callow freshmen, the four girls came across as more sophisticated. Michelle I knew from high school; Patricia was in one of my classes; Priya was a visa student from India; Kendra was an athlete enrolled at the Academy of Sport. Our group leader was Lorelei, a postgraduate student whom I found to be rather standoffish. She did her job well, but it was Rachel who held us together. Her satirical commentaries on conventions and institutions were an epiphany for us neophytes.<br>
<br>
We met once a week during the first term, once a fortnight in the second. Ben and I, outnumbered by the females, felt I must confess a little overawed. The girls were all very intelligent, articulate and highly motivated. It was hard not to feel that we mere males didn't measure up to their standard. That was nonsense, but I think it had something to do with the Lakeside Hall culture, which was focused on collaboration and a collective effort. This ethos, I believe, favours women, who tend to be better at interpersonal relationships and social interaction. But also, I don't think Ben and I were ideal specimens of manhood. I was immature and he could be obnoxious. The girls tolerated us — which was enough for me. I think Ben expected more.<br>
<br>
***<br>
One Saturday in May Laura invited me to a social gathering planned for that evening. I suspected, being given so little advance notice, that I was a last-minute replacement; but I was not going to turn down the summons. Nevertheless, the way she phrased it intrigued me. She asked me to be her escort. Now it's possible I misinterpreted. She may have simply meant to reinforce that this was not a boyfriend-type date... not that I was expecting it to be. On the other hand, the meaning I inferred was that she wanted a chaperone. This was very peculiar, coming from such an independent-minded young woman.<br>
<br>
However, she enlightened me.<br>
<br>
"It's C-M-N-F." The letters came out rather slurred, into something like "seemeneff," as if she wanted to blurt it them as quickly as possible. In response to my blank look she continued: "That's clothed male..."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I know what it stands for," I replied.<br>
<br>
"Naked female," she said anyway, needing to finish it. "So you know about these things?" She smiled, but with an odd, penetrating gaze into my eyes.<br>
<br>
"Purely academic. I was just..."<br>
<br>
"Do you have a problem with it?" she cut in. "If you're not interested..." She laughed at my expression. "I thought as much. Anyway, I have to go. See you at six."<br>
<br>
She didn't wait for me to react further. When she was gone I tried to analyze her words, looking for some disillusioning loophole. I even suspected it might be some crude practical joke. Laura did have an off-beat sense of humor; but she wasn't malicious. Yet I did find it odd that she couldn't find an escort from her cohort of consorts. For it did not occur to me, at the time, that she was trying to draw me into her social circle. That's how naïve — translation: pathetic — I was back then.<br>
<br>
So I decided to play along and see what happened. I didn't let Caitlyn know, making up the lie that I had a family commitment... for which I felt only slight guilt. I surmised that the party was an adventure club event. The context was some sort of "I dare you to..." battle of the sexes. The men's reciprocal challenge was so innocuous that I don't recall it, so I think they got the better of the deal. Of course, that depends on your perspective, and I never heard any of the women complaining.<br>
<br>
We met at the appointed hour and walked to a house not far from Lakeside Hall. I was nervous and Laura must have been as well, because she was in an abnormally chirpy mood, shooting off rapid-fire sentences in a high-pitched voice. Given where were heading, I felt some irrational disappointment that she was wearing a heavy sweater, jeans and boots.<br>
<br>
When we arrived, around two dozen people were already gathered in the living room. It was very large, more of an entertainment area, and the furniture had been shifted to one wall so everyone could mingle and not plant themselves on a sofa. Once everybody had turned up, there were thirty or so. Females slightly outnumbered males. One of the women was Rachel. She looked adorable — not a word I use very often — in a blue button-up miniskirt, apricot-yellow blouse and knee-socks, and shiny black shoes with oversized silver buckles. Her hair stuck out sideways in unplaited pigtails. Her partner was a guy named Jake who seemed to show only a half-hearted interest in her. It was only midway through the evening that I discovered that he was not her boyfriend, but an escort like myself. We said hello and Rachel seemed disconcerted by my presence. When I remarked off-hand that we'd be seeing each other again on Monday, her face took on a rosy pink hue.<br>
<br>
For the first thirty minutes or so it was just like a regular party, although the atmosphere was subdued. All the females were fully dressed. Indeed it was a cool evening, so there wasn't much skin visible at all. We drank beer and wine and listened to music. We chatted and got acquainted. Our hosts were a tall, graceful, extremely attractive woman in her late twenties named Charlotte, and James who had an irritatingly square-jawed handsomeness.<br>
<br>
Around seven o'clock, Charlotte turned the music down and the thermostat up. At least, I think she switched up the heating. It may have been my internal temperature rising. She didn't say anything, but the sudden drop in the noise level caused everyone to look about, and that's when she began unbuttoning her blouse. There was no announcement and no fanfare, nor was this a slow and seductive striptease. She started laughing and swapping jokes with her audience, and after she had pulled off the shirt she whirled it over her head a few times before letting go. It sailed across the room and came in to land atop one of the bookcases. We all cheered, and the other women began removing their tops. Every single one was wearing a bra, which I am sure was no coincidence. Most had two layers to shed, so the air in the room was momentarily filled with flying garments.<br>
<br>
Charlotte's flamboyant opening gesture was a clever ice-breaker. After we males had ogled the ladies for a while, and they had checked out each other, the proceedings went back to almost normal, except that every so often one of the girls would remove her skirt or slip out of her jeans. The half-dozen who had worn dresses were already in their undies after the first cast-off, which made it a bit easier for the rest. At one stage, a couple of the guys attempted to speed up the process by taking matters directly into their own hands. These efforts were swiftly deterred. In any case, such action proved unnecessary, as before long all every female was down to her bra and panties.<br>
<br>
Laura had looked around and then shrugged as she handed me her wine glass before reaching down to take off her boots. She grinned, apprehensively, as she unbuckled her belt, unzipped and opened the front of her jeans and pushed them down to her knees. She blushed when she realized how much interest was focused on her; and I felt proud that my partner was the center of attention. She fluttered her eyelashes and performed a pert pirouette before kicking off her denims; and as she took back her drink she curtly instructed me to retrieve them and her boots and place them with her sweater on a table in the corner.<br>
<br>
Laura was as stunning and sexy as I'd ever seen her, in a white satin halter-neck brassiere and matching briefs, trimmed with lacy frills. There was a little lavender bow at the tip of each breast, and another on her panties located cheekily over the crotch. After the initial jitters she did not seem at all self-conscious as she stood there being assessed and admired... except for a twinkle in her eyes and an impish curl of her lips.<br>
<br>
Just as Laura was finishing her performance, Rachel discreetly unhitched her skirt and let it fall to her ankles. When she'd stepped out of it, Jake picked it up and deposited it on the table with the rapidly growing pile of discarded clothing. She was wearing a mauve lacework demi-cup bra adorned with tiny woven blossoms, and a miniscule thong panty. But the girl had a certain style that made her look demure even when all that covered her sweet body could have easily fit into my trouser pocket. But then she stripped the ribbons from her hair, and the pigtails unraveled into two disheveled clumps. The effect was cutely comical, especially atop that lusciously unclad body.<br>
<br>
If this was as far as things had gone that night, it would still have been a fantastic party, and I doubt that anyone would have been disappointed. Not all the bodies were perfect, but all were well-toned and pleasing to the eye. This was hardly unexpected considering that most of the women belonged to a club which demanded a high level of health and fitness.<br>
<br>
Around eight o'clock Charlotte made the next move. She called into a huddle three of the other ladies, apparently at random. After conferring, they turned to face the rest of us, unfastened their bras and, following a few seconds of deep breaths and suppressed giggles, took them off. That prompted a most agreeable chain reaction, and within a matter of minutes every female in the room was bare-breasted.<br>
<br>
Indeed, none showed much hesitation. I guess they had already dipped their toes in the water, so to speak, by stripping down to their underwear. Maybe the alcohol acted as a lubricant, although no one was drinking heavily. The females understandably wanted to maintain their self-control, and the males didn't want to spoil the scenery by viewing it through a booze-induced blur — or worse, by misbehaving and ruining everything.<br>
<br>
Some of the girls were quite nonchalant about being topless. Others appeared shy and timid, avoiding eye contact and keeping their hands strategically positioned. Laura was in between. Once again she handed me her glass and drew in a lungful of air. She exhaled a half dozen soft, rapid puffs before reaching behind her back. She fiddled with the clasp for a moment and it only just occurred to me how difficult it is to unhitch a brassiere in situ. I was tempted to offer assistance, but none of the women in the room needed or wanted a helping hand. This was something they had to do by themselves. So Laura unfastened the little hook and allowed the bra to dangle by its halter. Finally, with a resolute firming of her jaws, she grasped the strap and lifted it over her head, pulling it off her body with an extravagant flourish that caused her breasts to quiver slightly. She held onto it for a moment, caressing the fabric, before handing it to me. She blushed, again, when I casually shoved it into my pocket. That was an absent-minded gesture, but it must have looked as if I was stashing a trophy.<br>
<br>
I'm sure this was not the first time that Laura had bared her chest in public. In fact, before that night I had seen her topless, albeit by accident in a poolside mishap. She's not prudish, nor especially bashful, and she doesn't mind displaying her assets. However, the differences here were the setting, the deliberate and methodical way in which she and the other women went about their stripping, and the fact that it was a one-sided display, with male partners and friends still fully clothed and keenly scrutinizing. Yet I had to laugh, sympathetically, of course, at normally unflappable Laura holding her drink in such a position that her hand and glass concealed one nipple, her forearm the other. Fortunately she saw the humor in her situation and smiled back. She gradually lowered her arm until her breasts were revealed in all their glory.<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed to say that I got rather fixated on her nipples. I expected them to be erect — as erect as... well, I'm sure you'll get my meaning when I confess that I was glad I'd had the forethought to wear baggy trousers. But it really didn't come as a shock that they were still soft. Although she and the other girls were obviously aroused, there was enough residual discomfiture that many were not feeling especially turned on... unlike their partners. Anyway, Charlotte's perspicacity in turning up the thermostat was not just about goosebumps.<br>
<br>
I glanced about furtively to see what was happening elsewhere, and relaxed when I saw that the other guys were doing the same, and no one seemed to mind. Nevertheless, I quickly averted my eyes if any of the women reacted with a twinge or a cringe, or otherwise looked embarrassed. However, they all seemed either comfortable with or reconciled to their state of undress, or too preoccupied with trying to appear at ease to be concerned about anyone staring.<br>
<br>
Naturally I had to see Rachel. She had delayed removing her top until she was one of the last to do so, and now realized this was a mistake. Even with a dozen pairs of naked breasts already on display, the attention kept shifting to those holding out. (It's interesting how the act of undressing tends to be even more provocative and stimulating than the end product.) Then, staring at something across the room, she crossed her arms to slide the straps off her shoulders. I thought her hands were going to linger there, but she pulled down the bra in a single smooth movement, freeing her arms and then bringing the rear part of the band round to the front to unhook it. The cups clung to her torso for a few tantalizing seconds, until she wiggled her body and the bra fell free. She caught it before it drifted all the way to the carpet. As she stood up straight again, her boobs jiggled nicely.<br>
<br>
Like Laura, Rachel was not stupendously endowed but made up for the lack of dimension with elegance of design. She made no attempt to cover herself, but kept her arms unnaturally tensed, her hands clasped at waist level or planted awkwardly on her hips. She was resisting the urge to raise them to her chest.<br>
<br>
Yet after a while, as we got used to the bare bosoms — the sight or the feeling, depending on gender — we all became conditioned to it. I guess semi-nudity is not such a taboo that you dwell on it for long. And once again, I would have been more than satisfied if things had progressed no further. But more delights lay ahead. The party's purpose had yet to be fulfilled. And when I think back on it, I don't know if stretching out the undressing ritual over an hour or so was a help or a hindrance for the girls. Certainly it gave them time to adjust. On the other hand, at each stage just as they found their new comfort zone, they were moved out of it. This had the effect of maximizing and intensifying the experience, and Charlotte orchestrated this like a symphony.<br>
<br>
The final act was once more kicked off by our hostess. She picked exactly the right moment, when there was a lull in the conversation and the music had stopped, and some people were becoming restless — the guys impatient, the girls just wanting to get it done. Yet many of the latter were clearly ambivalent. Laura silently rolled her eyes when she realized the time had come. Rachel muttered something inaudible to everyone but herself. One girl groaned softly, one rocked back and forth on the heels and balls of her feet while another swayed gently from side to side, as if slightly woozy. Most, however, laughed or just shrugged it off, although I suspected that was mainly façade.<br>
<br>
Wearing nothing but her g-string, Charlotte was almost unbearably sexy. Tall and curvy, with golden brown hair, olive skin, the body of a showgirl and a chorine's legs, she was not classically beautiful but radiated a self-assured sensuality. And while I feel a tad sleazy describing her this way, the fact is that she was spectacular. Her breasts were magnificent orbs. Unlike many of the others in the room, her rose-hued nipples were raised and hard. She basked in the attention she drew; but she never struck a pose, didn't flaunt. She had no need for that.<br>
<br>
The mood in the room changed when Charlotte reached to her hips and pushed her thong down her thighs. Everyone stopped to watch. I heard a couple of gasps. She was relaxed and unembarrassed. She conveyed a playful innocence that was almost childlike as she daintily handed the last of her clothing to James. Suddenly she seemed so fragile and vulnerable, with all of her glorious body exposed, nothing hidden, that little bit of her which had remained privately hers, and her man's, now public property.<br>
<br>
Almost all the women followed in unison. Laura looked up into my eyes, then lowered her gaze, perhaps starting to feel a few qualms. At this stage, any of the girls could have backed away from the final revelation, and no one would have disparaged her for doing so. Certainly none of us males was in a position to pass judgement. On the other hand Rachel, who had been hesitant about taking off her bra, all but leapt out of her panties. I think she was bursting to get it over with.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it's funny how a small piece of fabric can make such a difference. A minute earlier, half the bodies in the room were concealed by nothing more; and yet it's that last, forbidden one per cent of skin which, when revealed, transforms a woman. Whether she acts like a slut or a saint, prances and cavorts to show herself off or timidly shrinks from the spotlight, is strong or feeble, tough as nails or tender as a flower petal, is irrelevant. When she is naked, and all the women about her are nude, and all the men are fully clothed, she is defined in full, first and last, by her womanhood.<br>
<br>
I took a lingering look at Laura. I didn't try to be coy or even subtle, because I thought that would be hypocritical. She showed a little discomposure but stood there stoically, heroically, with her feet and knees slightly apart, her hands defiantly by her side, not hiding anything but (the impression was) poised to provide cover. The soft pink cleft between her legs was smooth, either shaven or waxed, as were most of the girls'.<br>
<br>
I turned to Rachel. She was still wearing her cutie-pie knee-socks and buckle-shoes — so charmingly incongruous, since she was completely naked above them. They were the first to catch the eye, and then my line of sight was drawn upwards, along her silken thighs to the velvet folds at the entrance to her body. The wisps of hair evoked a sense of a pristine simplicity and guileless lack of pretension that her impudent nakedness served to enhance rather than debase. Her pose was more submissive, or modest, than Laura's — hands behind her back, feet together but with one knee bent to position that leg slightly forward of the other, head erect but eyes downcast.<br>
<br>
Everyone tried to act casual; in fact, perhaps we tried too hard. Charlotte, the attentive hostess, proffered a glass of wine and Rachel took it, loosening out of her uneasy posture. Indeed, the mood all round turned effervescent once again. Perhaps it was the effects of the alcohol, but more likely, since Rachel didn't even sip her drink, it was the adrenaline, but the girls began to circulate, breaking away from their partners to mingle more freely than they had done with their clothes on.<br>
<br>
Except for the naked flesh, it was almost ludicrously banal. At one stage I found myself in conversation with four of the bare-skinned lovelies, exchanging advice on, of all things, bus routes and fares. I have no recollection of how the conversation got started, but in hindsight it was so marvelously trite, given the situation.<br>
<br>
The women now appeared completely at ease, although that could have been bravado. To be honest, I had been a little intimidated by the company — all these swashbuckling adventurers, fearless daredevils and intrepid thrill-seekers. But it does wonders for the male ego when you're casually chatting to a pretty girl when you're fully clothed and she's stark naked... let alone when there's four of them and just you, and everyone's trying to act like there's nothing out of the ordinary in the fact that you're the only one with clothes on, because you're the one with a penis.<br>
<br>
Of course, not everybody was so coy, but I didn't see any groping or other bad conduct. In fact, most of the unrestrained behaviour came from the females. After quickly getting over the initial, inevitable discomfiture, they were enjoying themselves as much as the guys, maybe even more so because they were able to let go of their inhibitions altogether, whereas we males felt obliged to keep a check on our impulses. There was no shame or humiliation; but at the same time there was no blatant exhibitionism or overt immodesty.<br>
<br>
That sounds odd, under the circumstances, but it's the difference between sexy and sleazy.<br>
<br>
One of those in our little conversation circle was a slender, dark-eyed brunette named Katrina — "Kat, with a K," she insisted. But she did have a quality that was undeniably feline — slinky, exotic and aloof. Her skin was a glossy sheen except for three healed but revealing scars, a small one on her left breast just below the nipple, a more ragged mark on her right hip, and a patch where the light sprinkling of pubic hair did not grow at all. (It amused me than even the briefest bikini would have hidden two of these from view.) These were the unmistakable signature of a devil-may-care lifestyle. She was standing beside me, and whenever she directed a comment at me she turned towards me and her bare breast brushed against my shirt sleeve. Then she'd emphasize a point and her firm nipple pressed into my arm. I don't know if she was doing it deliberately, or even if she was aware she was doing it at all. If she hadn't been nude I likely wouldn't have noticed.<br>
<br>
After a while, with some reluctance I detached myself from the group, when I saw that Rachel was standing alone. It was the first time I had a chance to share more than a couple of words since the party started. I couldn't resist a close-up inspection. She didn't seem to mind, or at least was becoming used to being looked over. She waited patiently till I was finished, with just the hint of a wry smile. She had taken off her shoes and socks and wasn't wearing jewellery or make-up. She was as bare as nature had provided, and nature had done a very good job. As I've mentioned, like Laura she's not stacked but her body is neatly and nicely proportioned.<br>
<br>
We talked for about five minutes, mainly about our tute group sessions. Then we were interrupted by Jake, who asked Rachel if she wanted a refill. She declined, with a raised eyebrow, as her wine was untouched, and to my relief he withdrew; but she turned and beckoned me to follow her into the kitchen. There was Charlotte, with a couple of the other girls and one of the guys, preparing snacks. And I have to say that familiarity was definitely not breeding contempt. The sight of the women busy at the bench, the succulent flesh of their bare backsides wiggling slightly as they worked, certainly piqued my appetite. Rachel started to assist, so I pitched in as well, cutting up salami and cheese.<br>
<br>
Charlotte offered me an apron, and I couldn't resist laughing out loud, which earned me some quizzical stares. I guess my sense of irony was not shared.<br>
<br>
As we carried out the plates of snacks, Charlotte declared that Laura had a few things to say. I realized then that she was the president of the adventure club; and I felt a sudden surge of self-importance, bathing in the reflected glory of being her escort. She said a few things, of which I don't remember much because I wasn't really listening. She thanked Charlotte and James for hosting the event, assured us that the fun was just getting started, made some announcements regarding the club. The party now moved into the next phase — indeed, as Laura promised, shifted into a higher gear. I think Charlotte and James had observed the sexual tension rising and decided this was the time to dissipate the energy by organizing some games. It surprised me not at all that the nudity was the centrepiece of every one we played.<br>
<br>
We started with a form of musical chairs, using plastic garden seats. The guys sat in a circle facing outwards. (It was a little more complicated, as I shall explain shortly.) The girls skipped around the outside, their breasts bobbing and swaying in a most agreeable manner, until "Sit!" was called. The music didn't stop. Instead, the girls perched on our knees, with their backs to us, and performed a lap dance. A not very salacious one, I must add. Then "Spin!" was called again and they leapt up and repeated the circuit; but this time when the girls descended upon our laps we were face to face.<br>
<br>
One of the girls, Gianna, sat out the game to act as the caller. She had a broken leg sustained, unsurprisingly, during one of the club's hazardous escapades. It hadn't occurred to me until then, but there is nothing cuter than a pretty girl who's naked but for a leg in plaster. To carry out her task impartially she was blindfolded. Talk about your fetish fantasy!<br>
<br>
It was a variation on the orthodox game, with no eliminations, scrambling for places or winners (except that we all were). It was pure gratuitous fun. And after a dozen rounds, more guys than just myself were in danger of wearing their enthusiasm on the front of their trousers. I got Rachel twice, facing both ways, which was pleasant, but not Laura. The most proficient at the game was — again, no big revelation — Charlotte. I was lucky to get her on the Spin, and she was brilliant. She clasped her hands behind her head, while I kept mine rigidly by my side, gripping the sides of my seat in fact, as she gyrated on my thighs. She was either very light or held up some of her weight on her legs, which would have been difficult with her knees bent and splayed. She pushed her face close to mine, her breathing wafting gentle puffs over my eyes and forehead, and she unabashedly rubbed her breasts against my chest. The tender abrasion of her nipples against the fabric of my shirt aroused her. I felt her breath quickening, and even her racing heartbeat through her breasts. She purred and licked her lips. She put on a performance like this with each guy she danced for, and by the end of the game she was flushed and panting. She's quite a woman.<br>
<br>
The game was exhausting for the dancers, so we had a break before beginning the next game. The girls relaxed on cushions or on the carpet while their menfolk brought drinks, and some towels to mop up the perspiration. They made an entrancing tableau, like haremgirls reclining in the seraglio.<br>
<br>
Before the energy ebbed too far, Charlotte clapped her hands and called us to the next game. This involved us forming circles, male-female with arms behind the back, to pass various objects, such as a shuttlecock, tennis ball and so on — unsubtle double entendres — from one to the next. Of course, in keeping with the party theme each object was lodged in the girls' cleavage. Those not so curvaceous had to hunch their shoulders forward to squeeze together their assets. And to make it more difficult, and thus more interesting, we guys had to tuck the object under our chin. So there was a lot of twisting and contorting and plenty of breast-to-chest-and-chin contact. The girls shuffled along the line to each guy in turn. Once the circuit had been completed, we males then had to transfer the objects to the females' thighs. Believe me, pressing your face into a nude girl's bosom and crotch is an experience not to be missed.<br>
<br>
None of the girls opted out of any game, which took a lot of pluck. If the roles had been reversed, I'm not sure how many of us of the "stronger sex" would have been so unflinching. And considering how risqué some of the goings-on were, it was probably a wise thing that only half the group were sans attire!<br>
<br>
There was another game that entailed emblazoning numbers and letters on the girls' buttocks with lipstick; I don't recall the reason. Nevertheless, we did push the boundaries of propriety a couple of times, most notably when the ice came out. The girls stared at the sparkling cubes with trepidation, but once the fun started none wavered. And what followed was remarkably, even profoundly intimate. I must admit that I was a little shocked at how far we went.<br>
<br>
The coffee table was used. Charlotte and James also moved the console and side tables into the middle of the room. Two guys were assigned to each, and we had two girls apiece on whom to work our frosty magic. Adam and I were among those who got the first go, to play with Laura and Kat. The girls took turns; and to make the experience more intense they were blindfolded. Laura was first. To my horror she recoiled as I tied the sash in place. For a couple of demoralizing seconds I thought it was my touch that repelled her; but she giggled and ran her fingertips over the black satin. Her loss of sight had made her feel more exposed and accessible. She liked that.<br>
<br>
Charlotte and James were another of the first couples, and they took the coffee table. Unlike the other, wooden, furniture it had a marble top and was obviously cold, because when Charlotte lay down she released a loud gasp. She and James could observe us newbies, offering advice and tips, and she did so while blindfolded, which was impressive, and between exclamations and exudations of pleasure, which was also impressive. They told us to be alert to signs of distress on the girls' skin, such as burning sensations, excessive redness, pins and needles; but they never mentioned the word "frostbite".<br>
<br>
I also admired Laura who heard the warnings and wasn't daunted. She reclined on her back with her hands clasped behind her head and feet planted on the floor. Adam and I had our fun with her for about ten minutes. We ran several cubes over her body until they melted and her skin glistened. We rubbed the ice around her throat, across her breasts, over her nipples and down her stomach and into her crotch. I would have stopped there, but we were still following the lead of Charlotte and James. When she admonished us "Don't leave it inside her for more than a minute," Adam got the message first and slid the ice into Laura's body. She winced and trembled, clenched her jaws to keep from squealing, and tensed her body to stop squirming.<br>
<br>
While Adam was working down below, I repeated the circuit of her face, neck, breasts and belly. I stared into that beautiful face hidden behind her blindfold and, knowing what she was feeling, wondered what she was thinking. Her skin, though slippery with a glaze of meltwater, was quite warm until the ice passed over it. Her occasional twitch and shiver were not, I was sure, a response to the cold but rather from arousal and anticipation. And as I ran my hands over her luscious body, it was like a dream. In my wildest fantasies I had not imagined this. And then Adam dropped two new cubes onto her stomach and nodded at me. We didn't speak, but Laura must have known that it was I who was about to penetrate her.<br>
<br>
I whispered "You okay?" She smiled but bit her lower lip.<br>
<br>
By the time I had finished with her, my fingers were numb from the chill, so I can only imagine what it was like for Laura. Of course, our hosts knew their business. They provided bowls of heated water so that we guys didn't end up with frozen fingertips. Adam took over again to apply the ice between Laura's legs before, finally, she sat up and shook her head. I helped her, still blindfolded, to her feet, but she slipped through my arms to sit on the carpet. She stayed sightless for the rest of the game, listening to the chorus of sighs and gasps and moans. Some girls were quite loud while others remained stoically silent.<br>
<br>
Kat was perhaps the most taciturn of all. While awaiting her turn, unlike the others who showed a variety of emotions (mainly impatience, I was relieved to note), she showed — dare I say it? — an icy indifference. So maybe to stir up a more impassioned response, Adam proved quite cold-blooded — okay, no more puns — as he went about his business, and I wantonly followed his lead. Our victim never flinched. As I glided the ice over her flesh, I was impressed at how rock solid were her muscles. She had a flinty toughness matching her steely disposition. When I slid my chunks of ice between her legs, I saw the tendons on her arms tighten and her lips puckered ever so slightly, but she stayed silent and immobile as I ran my fingertips through the wet matted hair — she was unshaven down below — and pushed the ice just a little bit between her folds and held it there. She brought a hand down to brush mine away and I thought she'd found her limit. Instead she pushed the ice further into her body with two fingers. It stayed there until it had completely melted and the frigid water dribbled down the insides of her thighs onto the tabletop.<br>
<br>
By the end of this game, which James called "Ice-and-Slow", the girls needed a break. It was closing in on midnight, and for the first time a few of the couples engaged in some dalliance. No one could blame the guys in particular for taking the opportunity for a bit of intimate caressing and fondling, but everyone stayed in the room, and those of us without romantic partners relaxed, chatted, listened to music, drank some more. I was thinking that the CMNF was over; but the girls remained naked.<br>
<br>
Laura, it didn't surprise me, was holding court with her devotees, talking and laughing with two or three guys at a time. She was sitting cross-legged on the floor, giving her courtiers an unimpeded view of her glorious womanhood. Any trace of the shyness and coyness that she and the other girls might have displayed early in the evening had melted away like the ice cubes.<br>
<br>
However, the pair who perhaps had the best time of it were Nessa and Julie, a lesbian couple. They were what might be described as a "stud-femme" and "lipstick lesbian", and they conformed to these labels. Nessa had short, spiky hair and came to the party in dungarees and Doc Martens boots. Julie wore a frilly dress and glitter-covered sneakers. Of course, both stripped off their clothes and took an eager part in the games. But those which involved male-female partnering caused an interesting dilemma. Being proudly female, Nessa was happy to be naked and certainly didn't want to be treated as a male. However, during the musical chairs she was one of the seated players. None of the women had any more qualms about performing with her than with the males, and she enjoyed herself as much as the clothing-wearers — if not more.<br>
<br>
As for the Ice-and-Slow, I wasn't paying attention, being focused on my own task, but assume that Nessa and Julie switched positions. At the end of the games they kissed and cuddled, and appeared more relaxed than the other smooching couples. This was because both were nude; and it reminded me of the mixed message behind CMNF. When the woman is naked and the man fully clothed, that can be interpreted as her asserting herself by expressing her sexuality in its most potent form; or it may be seen as an expression of his dominion over her. For Laura, always in control of her relationships, I could assume it was the former. But then, I had never seen her in make-out mode. And for a mad moment I was tempted to try my luck. Of course I resisted the urge, though it wasn't a matter of chickening out. There was still too much of a familial bond between us. I could gaze upon her naked body, and she seemed pleased to be gazed upon, and I could touch it as part of a game; but there would be no going further.<br>
<br>
The party continued almost till dawn, albeit more sedately. The highlight was an impromptu round of Ice-and-Slow. Rachel didn't drink alcohol and I was a moderate imbiber, so we were both somberly sober and in need of stimulation. She winked at me, then lay on her back on the coffee table, spreading her arms and legs. It was interesting that she chose the marble top. She grimaced as her bare derriere touched it.<br>
<br>
As I brushed the ice over Rachel's sleek body and satin-smooth skin, her eyelids flickered and then closed, her lips pursed, her nipples rose and the flesh between her thighs began to twitch. Even with everything which had happened that night, I had never a woman so completely in my thrall. She was softly moaning; her feet began to drum on the floor; her head rolled to one side then the other; but she kept her arms at her side, so that I would have total control. It was extraordinary how she could be so passive and yet, by her responses, so self-assured in guiding me to how far I could go. I decided to be more aggressive, teasing her most tender and sensitive parts. Her eyes opened and connected with mine, and I marveled at how wonderfully vulnerable and sexy she was, lying there naked, writhing and trying to keep from laughing hysterically as I tormented her. And when I passed the cube down over her belly, her right hand moved for the first time, to direct mine over her pubes. I was reluctant to go all the way but she pressed my fingers and the ice into her crease. She bit her lip, but in ecstasy not agony, and she held my hand in place.<br>
<br>
At the end she sat up and stared at me. For the first time since she had stripped off her clothes, that pretty face showed a tinge of regret. We both struggled for words until she heard Jake's voice and turned away, just not fast enough for me to miss her expression of relief. They left the party not long after.<br>
<br>
Eventually we all went home. For some time Laura and I did not talk about that night; but nothing seemed to have changed between us. So I decided that it had been just another of her "extreme" adventures. Yet there would be a sequel, and not even anything at the CMNF party prepared me for that.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I had my last tute group meeting with Rachel before the end of semester. It was just two days following the party. We convened on the lawn outside Lakeside Hall. Rachel took the lead, businesslike and confident in a discussion about expectations for the year's second half. She was wearing jeans and a sweater; the sun was shining and it was unseasonably warm; but whenever my eyes and hers met she shivered. She quickly looked away with a mischievous smile. I don't know if the others even noticed this. None were aware of what we were recalling — that I had seen our sanguine, take-charge group leader in a different setting, in the flesh, in all her bare-skinned glory. I had gazed upon her exquisite naked torso as she lap-danced for me, had teased that delectable body with cubes of ice, watched the rivulets of meltwater dribble from her breasts and belly. Of course, those were my thoughts. I cannot vouch for Rachel's.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was Kat's offbeat persona which gave me the most food for thought. I was struck by how impeccably she embodied that combination of coy and coquettish, provocative and passive, displayed by all the women to some extent. Still, it took a lot of courage to go where they had gone that night. And a way I envied them. Before that evening I would have sworn it would be the males who'd get the most pleasure from the party. And as the night progressed I might have felt superior to the females, wrapped up as I was in the accoutrements of masculinity. But it was impossible to feel any self-importance. We males were really no more than onlookers to the women's experience. Any pleasure we felt was subsumed by theirs.<br>
<br>
And so this is how it ended, the first leg of a journey into very strange territory.

— Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun<br>
<br>
Throughout my life I've had it easy. That's not a boast nor a confession, simply a fact. In school I was top of the class in all my subjects. I was captain of the debating team and president of the student council. I think I'm above average good-looking. I'm not sporty but have a trim, healthy figure. This has all come with little effort; and that also is not bragging, because I never really earned it. My best qualities are the product of genetics and upbringing, factors that are not within one's personal control.<br>
<br>
It is the awareness of this unearned privilege which (I hope) has prevented my becoming a smug perfectionist or a spoilt brat. Indeed, it has impelled me to constantly push myself, to pursue fresh challenges, to expose myself to new experiences and open my mind to unexpected insights, to discover what strengths I possess and test where my limits lie. So when I began studying at university and living away from home, my extended horizons expanded my opportunities to explore unfamiliar paths. And where those paths might lead, I had no idea. But that was the point.<br>
<br>
I considered several options for on-campus accommodation and settled on Lakeside Hall. I was keen on the ethos of self-reliance, but also on the fact that it was very selective in its admissions policy. I wasn't being snobbish. Having been an overachiever for so long, I welcomed being a fish out of water and (to continue the piscine metaphor) a little fish in a big pond. And of course, in the transition from schoolgirl to uni student my life did change, in several ways besides moving out of town. I expanded my social life. I tried to become more spontaneous and adventurous. I resolved to stay assertive but be less bossy. I made a real effort to improve my fashion sense. I experimented with alcohol and some other (innocuous) drugs, although I have never seen the appeal of mood-altering substances. I lost my virginity.<br>
<br>
I tried to stay true to my boyfriend. Mark and I had been a couple for a few years; and my teenage naïveté led me to believe our relationship would last a lifetime; but it did not survive separation. Although we both went on to tertiary study, we were living three hours' drive apart. His was a "provincial" university; and as well as being discouraged by the distance, I believe he resented the fact that I attended a more prestigious institution. So while I don't regret that I gave up my virginity for him, I had no strong pangs about our splitting. Indeed, to be honest, I felt a little relieved to be cutting one of the ties to my adolescence.<br>
<br>
In academia I thrived. While I hadn't found ivory towers or halls of ivy, being a university student was everything I hoped it would be and most of what I expected, with none of the things I dreaded. I loved my subjects, enjoyed my classes, scored well on my exams and assignments.<br>
<br>
I got on well with my roommates — tall elegant Zahra, brittle romantic Cassandra, and especially Stephanie, petite, pert and perky. Our quarters were modest though not cramped, and Lakeside Hall had enough amenities that four hundred residents could live together without friction. In fact, when we moved on to twin-share bedrooms in our second year, the break-up was a little traumatic. But Steph and I stayed together, while Zahra and Cassie had the room next to ours. On the other side were lithesome Layla and sultry Selena. Directly across the corridor from them were two guys, Matthew and Tony, who could often be heard, usually late at night, crossing the gap. Steph and I would listen to the climax of their rendezvous through the walls, and sometimes we ate popcorn.<br>
<br>
When we returned after the summer break as sophomores, Stephanie was on crutches. She'd sustained an ankle fracture while on an "adventure vacation". It didn't surprise me. Steph was a wild child. Notwithstanding her diminutive stature and playful disposition, she was tough, tenacious and utterly fearless. And she displayed those qualities not just in the face of physical challenges, but mental ones as well. She hated being in any sort of comfort zone. However, she wasn't like me. She had no need or desire to test herself. What she sought was sensation. She wanted to live each moment of her existence as intensely as possible. This took her to some strange places; and I eventually followed, out of curiosity although to this day I'm not sure why I stayed.<br>
<br>
Steph belonged to a club devoted to adventure. It was based at Lakeside Hall and had around forty active members, all female. Its guiding philosophy was a form of hedonism, to celebrate "the outré", going beyond what's normal and safe, with "ultimate" sports and unconventional challenges. But it seemed to me more thrill-seeking than adventure-loving, and indeed the club was, as much as anything else, a way to prove that women can have balls as big and brassy as any man's... at least metaphorically. This didn't appeal to me, and Steph's injury was my vindication.<br>
<br>
She vanished most weekends, to reappear on Sunday evening or Monday morning. I was intrigued but also disappointed, because it meant we shared fewer fun times. So when she invited me to one of their Saturday night gatherings, I eagerly accepted. The theme was "extreme cuisine". It featured an appetizing assortment of creepy crawlies, bugs, grubs, worms, spiders, boiled, baked and battered. I was proud of the fact that I was far from the first to start heaving and retching. But no one actually vomited.<br>
<br>
The following weekend's activity was an escapade in the wilderness; but I was rostered to work. In lieu of fees and charges, except for nominal levies, Lakeside residents are assigned jobs in housekeeping and catering. I could have arranged to swap schedules but was in any case suffering from a mild cold.<br>
<br>
I spent Easter with my family. After that there was an election for the House Committee. I thought about nominating but had sated my taste for student politics in my schoolgirl days. But I was impressed by the fact that most residents took enough interest to vote, and that ten of the twelve elected members were females. I instead answered my call to public service in two ways. I signed up for a refresher program for the first aid course I'd taken last year. The classes were held at Lakeside Hall for residents and were run by Olivia, a qualified doctor engaged in postgraduate study.<br>
<br>
I also volunteered as a sophomore counsellor for one of the tutorial groups which mentored first-year students. The group leader, Lorelei, was a postgrad, and we provided advice, assistance and counselling on issues involving the transition from school to university and from living at home to the communal lifestyle of Lakeside Hall. Lorelei was conscientious but not very approachable. So I carried most of the load (which I didn't mind). My acolytes were four girls, Michelle, Patricia, Priya and Kendra, and two guys who were roommates. The latter stood out not so much because they were the only males in our clique of eight but because they were diametrical opposites personality-wise. Daniel was introverted and socially awkward albeit in a likeable way, intelligent and attentive. Ben, on the other hand, seemed to me a little off — not exactly creepy, but unkempt and shifty-eyed, and more supercilious than he had any right to be. He was condescending towards women and didn't like getting guidance from us.<br>
<br>
On Saturday night before classes resumed after the ten-day Easter break, the Lakeside House Committee hosted a party. The theme was "Naughty Nightie Night". Twee appellative notwithstanding, it was one of those affairs which had given "Lakeside Hell" a reputation for dissolute depravity on other parts of the campus. And it's not like the notoriety was entirely undeserved, even if the disapproval was inspired (I believe) mostly by envy. The post-Easter party was a traditional highlight of the sexual and sensual dolce vita. The previous year's theme had been "playboys and bunnies", and before that "pirates and their booty". So it was essentially an excuse for the women to loosen up and let go, strip down and show off. We turned out in our most slinky, seductive lingerie; and while not everyone got into the spirit, most of us did. It was nice to look and feel supersexy and ultrafeminine, to revel in being female. I wore a charmeuse, floral-pattern teddy with garter belt and stockings. The latter were not my standard style... but neither was being out in public in my undies. Stephanie, whose usual mode was sweatshirt and cargo shorts, had transformed from adorable to delectable in a rose pink bra and thong panties and a black lace choker. Most of the males were elegantly attired in tuxedos Bond-style, or outfitted in Hefner-style smoking jackets. So perhaps the gender contrast was sexist; but no one was pressured into anything, and nobody took it seriously.<br>
<br>
Around mid-evening Steph found me in the crowd and suggested that I stay away from our room for the next hour or so. She had in tow a young guy I'd seen around the place. The straps of her bra were already dangling unhitched, so she didn't need to say anything more.<br>
<br>
While I never saw Daniel that night, Ben was one of the James Bond wannabes. I noticed that he spent most of the evening hovering around the older girls. His stare lingered a little too long on their lingerie-clad forms, including his sister's. (Emily was a third-year student, absolutely gorgeous, who for some unfathomable reason doted on her brother.) He complimented me on how sexy I looked, which might seem innocuous, but when combined with unsubtle nonverbal cues it came across as sleazy. Being charitable I think he misread the situation. Even dressed as we were (slutty, if you will), engaging in "normal" social interaction, looking good and feeling great, we didn't need or want to make a big deal of it. That's why no one (except Ben and one or two other guys) felt the need to comment, apart from an initial, flattering "You look great!" Those girls who wished for special attention won it with more provocative poses and suggestive words... which was fine. Self-confidence comes in multifarious forms.<br>
<br>
Ben also made a point of letting anyone who'd listen know that I was his group counsellor, as if this were important news. He associated clothing, or its lack, with status; and I don't think he saw women through any lens but his own. Therefore my déshabillé condition redressed his neophyte role on campus.<br>
<br>
Now I am aware of my tendency to overanalyze, so I shall move on.<br>
<br>
Six weeks after the Naughty Nightie Night, Stephanie invited me to the club's latest caper. She was unusually coy about the details until she'd wrested an acceptance from me. And when she revealed that it was a "CMNF" party all she got was a blank stare. She clarified, and was mildly surprised when I nodded (albeit in silence). It was one of those club activities which convinced me that the club's real raison d'être was the pursuit of the thrill. I was curious about how I would cope with such a challenge; and I convinced myself that it would be no big deal to be stark naked in front of friends, acquaintances and strangers. After all, I hadn't worn much more on the lingerie night. And I was, in a way, reassured that the males were to remain fully clothed. It wouldn't be an orgy.<br>
<br>
Stephanie said I should bring a male partner. Richard and I had been together for a few months. It was a casual affair, more than a fling but less than a love story. But I decided against choosing him, and fobbed him off that Saturday night with some lame excuse. Whereupon Steph hitched me up with mutual friend Jake, and I laughed at her selection because he was openly gay. But she reproached me because that doesn't mean being "one of the girls"; and Jake told me later that he can appreciate the aesthetic appeal of female nudity. It was hard to argue with that.<br>
<br>
As for my outfit, I decided to make an ironical statement — a "sugar-and-spice" ensemble of blue denim miniskirt, tangerine blouse and knee-socks, and big-buckle Mary-Jane shoes. I fixed my hair in unbraided pigtails; and the look would have been complete with painted-on freckles; but I felt that any hint of mockery would seem like false bravado. The venue was a house just off-campus, a short walk from Lakeside Hall, owned by a woman named Charlotte. Most of the people from the "extreme cuisine" banquet were there. Everyone came in male-female pairs. I was put a little off-stride to see Daniel, but was glad that Ben hadn't been invited.<br>
<br>
Charlotte was a former Lakeside resident doing research of some kind at the university. Statuesque and voluptuous, she had an aura of sensuality that she projected onto everyone around her. Her husband James was very handsome even if he gave off a silkily suave "toy boy" vibe. He clung to and was constantly petting and fondling his wife, which she appeared to tolerate rather than enjoy. Apart from that, she appeared to be the one in control. So their relationship had an odd dynamic. It was as if they were role-playing (but it was impossible to tell what was role and what was real).<br>
<br>
In my authorial collaboration with Daniel I am leaving him to describe in detail most of what happened that night. But my biggest revelation was that, having overcome a modicum of initial shyness, I had no problem stripping naked, and even enjoyed myself. But taking off our clothes was a drawn-out process, whereas I would have preferred a quick undressing. And with the men watching, I could feel each item being peeled off my body; it was like a chill breeze on my skin. Their male gaze was like clammy hands groping and probing my curves and crevices. I tingled on the outside and tickled inside. I felt my face becoming flushed and my nipples hardening. That, I confess, was disconcerting, like what a guy must feel with an untimely erection, but in my case without clothing to hide it. Yet I didn't feel embarrassed, at least not as much as I expected.<br>
<br>
However, it surprised me that some of the women didn't react as I did. Either they weren't as keyed up or they hid it well. By contrast, Charlotte (whose lustrous torso bore no hint of tan lines) made no effort to conceal her arousal. But what none of us felt was visible shame in being naked. I didn't see anyone try to cover herself. Indeed, doing so would have made her more conspicuous, in no way diverting attention away from her nudity but revealing humiliation rather than confidence and pride.<br>
<br>
The men tried to maintain eye contact, but I couldn't blame them when their field of view drifted southward. Of course, they kept their clothes on. In fact, its one-sided nature gave our nudity an extra piquancy. Yet there was no sense that we females were debased or objectified; and while I hesitate to use the term "empowering", it was a liberating experience, divesting myself of my inhibitions along with my clothes. The erotic context was undeniable, and yet most of the time I felt less sexualized than on the Naughty Nightie Night. For while it's been said that the essence of dressing sexy is to show your best and hide the rest, revealing everything allows you to convey assertive eroticism without being wanton. So the mood of the evening was a sort of free-spirited innocence.<br>
<br>
Even so, we played some very intimate games. We were relaxing after one of these and had split spontaneously into separate knots of guys and girls. It fascinated me that while the men kept looking at us — they couldn't get enough of the décor — the female groups had reflexively turned inwards, as if taking a break from the males' attention. But as a result I was able to see the faces of the other girls when Charlotte and James came into the room bearing large bowls filled with ice cubes. The expressions ranged from alarm to bewilderment to delight. Somebody groaned. I admit that it took me a few seconds to catch on, then I started shivering, before any ice had left its bowl.<br>
<br>
Charlotte explained that "ice-play" is a marvellous way to stimulate your brain and body at the same time but in different ways. She announced that we would be blindfolded as well, to enhance the experience. My suspicion that this party was more than merely (merely?) CMNF was solidifying.<br>
<br>
We played in two-couple rounds. Jake and I were paired with Stephanie and Dev (short for Devraj, her guy from the lingerie party). We were assigned the second session and watched enthralled as the girls who went before us responded to the ice. Some were jiggly and jittery, others remained passive. When they were finished (and the girls, to my relief, looked disappointed), Stephanie was selected to go next, simply by being nearer to the vacated coffee table. She briefly clasped my hand as Dev wrapped a black satin sash about her head and over her eyes. The two guys guided her, by her arms, to the table, and as she sat her jaw dropped and she emitted a cute and comical "Ooh!" Jake touched the surface of the table and grinned. It was an evil grin. Steph's body twitched as she lowered her bare backside onto the tabletop, which was made of frigid marble. She squirmed as she lay flat on her back. I shuddered as I awaited my turn.<br>
<br>
It was strange watching little Stephanie (and the other girls) being both tormented and titillated by the ice. At one point she whimpered and bit her lower lip which I thought would bleed. She grasped the legs of the table to steel herself and to keep from interfering with the men's work. She pressed her knees together until the guys prised them apart, but did not resist when Dev ran two lumps of ice down her belly, between her thighs and into her. She wriggled and giggled. When it was over, she almost leapt from the table, still blindfolded, her skin glistening with ice-water and sweat.<br>
<br>
"Over already?" she sighed. "Do we get a second go?<br>
<br>
Jake beckoned for me to replace her, with a cartoonish leer. He blindfolded me and both guys assisted me to lie down. I expected that the table would have been warmed by Steph; but marble is a wonderful conductor; it had absorbed her body heat completely. So the first contact was a jolt to my system. Yes, it was pretty illogical to be fazed by that, given what was about to happen.<br>
<br>
I tried to remain stoical as the two guys began by rubbing the ice on my earlobes, lips and cheeks, along the edges of my blindfold and across my throat. Then they slid the cubes, never lifting them from my skin, over my chest, caressing my breasts and teasing my nipples. I think my body spasmed once or twice. But though I started out tense I soon found myself (to my amazement) relaxed, almost tranquil. It was a weird sensation which should have been unpleasant but was instead delicious. When the ice first touched my sensitized teats I was expecting something like an electric shock. Instead it was more of a tingle, with a slow pulsation as blood rushed in to warm my flesh. The ice was already partly thawed so it wouldn't stick and could slip and slide over the skin. And the meltwater tickled as it trickled down my sides to pool under my back, bottom and thighs.<br>
<br>
Being sightless really did make the experience more intense even though, from having watched the girls who came before me, I knew what was next. The guys stroked my stomach. The water filled my navel and then dribbled into my cleft.<br>
<br>
"Spread your legs," Jake whispered. Gay or not, from the tone of his voice I knew he was enjoying the game.<br>
<br>
I braced myself as a hand cupping two cubes settled into my crotch. After a minute or so of chilly massage, the hand pressed the ice into me. I couldn't hold back a moan. The walls of my vagina constricted, so after he'd removed his hand I held my muscles tight to keep it inside me. There was no numbing or prickling. My body heat quickly melted the lumps, and even as the liquid seeped out of me Jake inserted two more. I knew who it was because I heard James say "Steady, Jake; don't overdo it." With that cue, when Jake pulled back I relaxed, and the ice popped out of me.<br>
<br>
Dev, meanwhile, had not stopped his stimulation of the other parts of my torso, and also my arms and legs, even the soles of my feet (the only time I felt any real twinges). He missed hardly a spot on my body not in contact with the tabletop. The result was, even though I had prematurely ejaculated my second dose of ice cubes, an ecstasy I have rarely known. And I'm sure that sounds bizarre, especially as it was delivered by a near-stranger and a gay guy. And it would have been embarrassing to be so turned on in front of people I hardly knew; except that they were all going through the same thing... well, half of them, anyway.<br>
<br>
Still, I must give credit to the males. They performed well, considering that their pleasure was peripheral. Jake understood and navigated my erogenous zones like a... well, not an expert but a talented rookie.<br>
<br>
When that game ended the night was barely half over. In fact, a couple of hours later I found myself volunteering for a second round of ice-play. This time it I partnered with Daniel, and by now we had both shed our inhibitions. This was around midnight, and Jake and I finally left at about three in the morning. It actually felt strange, and oddly erotic, to be getting dressed in the middle of the living room. (The melted ice had long since dried off our bodies; but even that is an agreeable sensation, having the water slowly evaporate from your skin, cooling you as it carries away heat before you begin to warm up.) A couple of girls decided to remain naked as they left, but immediately ran back into the house to put on their clothes. It was freezing outside.<br>
<br>
We walked back to Lakeside Hall, about a dozen of us, under a moonless, cloudless, diamond-studded sky. A light but steady breeze lowered the apparent temperature, and I cursed myself for wearing just a miniskirt and a flimsy blouse. But when Jake gallantly offered me his coat I haughtily rejected it. I immediately apologized for my ingratitude, but he laughed it off. I think he believed I was trying to relive my exquisite ordeal with the ice. No; I was just being churlish.<br>
<br>
After that night, I began to see the adventure club in a new light. There was a pattern to its activities which seemed more than merely audacious exploits. From the conversation that evening I discovered that Charlotte was one of its founders, and a member of another group I heard mention, the Empyreal Society. This one was more cryptic; Stephanie didn't seem to know about it; but I didn't get a sinister vibe. When, from time to time, I inquired from people I thought might know, the brush-offs were good-natured rather than unfriendly. In any case, I would eventually find myself drawn in.<br>
<br>
Something else changed. Whenever I encountered guys who had been at the party, they looked at me differently... not in a leering way but rather with respect and admiration. And that might have been my imagination; but at our tute group meetings Daniel seemed a little less reserved, at least towards me. Whenever our eyes connected, I felt naked again, but without discomfort. And while the others in the group must surely have sensed that we shared a secret, to his credit Daniel never let on.<br>
<br>

"Bondage is the life of personality, and for bondage the personal self will fight with tireless resourcefulness and the most stubborn cunning."<br>
<br>
— Aldous Huxley, After Many A Summer<br>
<br>
(Yes, I know this quotation isn't about rope bondage; but Huxley's observation is astute, and the book is worth reading... if you don't mind monologues.)<br>
<br>
The month following the CMNF party was uneventful. There was the last week of classes, and then the revision and exam period. After that I decided to stay on campus for the mid-year vacation, with a couple of trips back home. Stephanie tried to interest me in one of her club's excursions, without success; but to make up for my refusal I agreed to another Saturday night gathering. Steph called it a "Shibari night". I did my research and at first declined the invitation; but as before doubt gave way to curiosity, and even excitement. For in my teens my guilty pleasure was the melodramatic romance novel. My favourite subgenre was the bodice-ripper. I fantasized being a damsel in distress — albeit feisty not feeble. So I had always wanted to be tied up, to experience what it would feel like being both helpless and heroic.<br>
<br>
The people there were mostly those as on the previous nights, with a few additions and subtractions. (Daniel was one of the latter.) We convened at Charlotte's house once more. Again we came as couples, and this time I brought Richard. I suspect that he knew about the CMNF party. If he did he showed no resentment. (While I hadn't felt guilty over leaving him out, I worried that someone would spill the beans. But no one did. The adventure club members were discreet.)<br>
<br>
Stephanie by now had moved on from Devraj. She was accompanied by Oscar. He was a first-year student who visited our dormitory often because his sister Alice, a postgrad, shared a room with Jessica, a second-year student like Steph and me. Alice and Jessica had been friends before moving into Lakeside Hall; and both were members of the adventure club. That's probably how Oscar and Steph became attached. I found him a bit immature, but that no doubt helped him in coping with Steph's ofttimes frenetic personality. (I mention this because they all will feature in my story.)<br>
<br>
We kicked off with snacks and drinks. Those of us who weren't club regulars nevertheless knew everyone, from preceding encounters. Ominously, Charlotte warned us ladies to avoid the coffee because of its diuretic effect. Ten minutes later she cleared her throat and took off her dress, shoes and jewellery. The rest of us women followed her lead. It was another cold night, but we'd been told to wear a bikini under our clothes. I chose my favourite, the lime green Agustina. The males stayed fully clothed. They tried not to ogle, and none of us seemed particularly fazed at stripping down in front of them. It was not so much different from doing so on the beach, except that this wasn't a beach, it was a suburban house, and the men remained fully clothed. Of course, with the Nightie Night and CMNF party still fresh in our minds, the nonchalance was not really surprising. I deposited my shirt, jeans, shoes and watch in a corner of the living room alongside the rest of the discarded clothing.<br>
<br>
Charlotte explained that a key part of the bondage experience is the tactile sensation, feeling the ropes tight against your bare skin. She said that the pattern and texture of your rigid bonds provide an enhancing contrast with your soft, smooth skin and supple, yielding flesh — a visual treat for your partner and a sensual one for you. And while the erotic essence of bondage is obvious, I must confess that I hadn't been thinking of it as an aesthetic or sensory experience. James added that tying up a woman is like creating a work of art. Your body is his tableau. Charlotte elaborated. The ropes may follow the natural contours of your curves and crevices or they may create shapes and forms, in ways that bring pleasure to both the artist and his subject. And even though your own role is passive, you participate equally. In fact, the submissive's is the more profound experience. What your master does is by him but to you. And in that respect it is like having sex (with a man). He is the giver and you are the receiver; your gift to him is the acceptance of his. The power over your body that you surrender to him flows back into you.<br>
<br>
(I should add that Charlotte and James used the words "submissive" and "master" simply to mean the person who submits to the ropes and the one who applies them. I should add as well that the evening's motif was female bondage; but I did get the impression that this is how it always is for them.)<br>
<br>
Charlotte concluded the introduction with a reassurance that sounded more like a warning. "Your bondage shouldn't be easy," she said. The paradox of sensual bondage is that the more stringent and strenuous it is, the greater the joy for both partners. That was something I had yet to be convinced of. I looked around at the faces of the other women and saw mostly frowns. But I reminded myself of the club's motto, "Nulla gloriam sine insania" — "There is no glory without madness"; and of Stephanie's personal philosophy, that comfort zones are for sissies.<br>
<br>
Thereafter Charlotte ushered us down a pink-paneled corridor to a large chamber at the rear of the house. There was something weird about that hallway, with its spongy red carpet, subdued lighting and acoustics that reduced the few words anyone spoke to whispers. As we exited into the harsh light at the end, it was like emerging from the birth canal. It gave the strange but distinct impression that it was designed this way, as if the path along the passage represented a rebirth of some kind.<br>
<br>
The room had a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams. It was bare of furniture except for a row of tables against one wall, on which were heaped coils of ropes, stacks of satin sashes, a pile of variously coloured vinyl ball-gags and some other paraphernalia. There were mats laid out in rows on the polished wooden floor. Charlotte gave us a moment to take in the sight. The expressions on the faces of the girls around me — wide eyes, open mouths, flushed cheeks, sweaty brows — and the gasps and giggles spoke the unspoken words. Of course, as James began handing out nylon ropes and satin sashes to the males, their expressions were of slightly embarrassed glee. However, while everyone tried not to appear too excited, no one seemed overly nervous. After all, these people had climbed mountains, descended cliffs, jumped out of aeroplanes, eaten bugs. The mission statement of the adventure club was about going beyond conventional margins.<br>
<br>
We started with a warm-up of calisthenics and other loosening-up exercises, to enhance our flexibility and endurance, and also to boost our confidence and self-discipline. An unfocused mind, Charlotte explained, is as detrimental to good bondage as an unprepared body. To have control over your responses allows you to immerse yourself in the ropes' embrace, to receive the full experience and to prolong it. I noticed some of the women nodding and smiling; Stephanie was one. Others, like myself, were more tense. So the workout enabled us to shake off some of the jitters.<br>
<br>
The males were not allowed to opt out of this, although some wanted to stand back and enjoy at their leisure the sight of us jigging and bobbing, sweating and puffing and straining in our bikinis. But Charlotte insisted they join in.<br>
<br>
"You and your partner must have patience and self-discipline," she explained. "It makes it more enjoyable for the both of you, and you will be able to tie her up for longer, and more strictly, if she's relaxed and comfortable."<br>
<br>
Charlotte then told us females to put on our blindfolds. I folded my sash, which was midnight blue, so I could tie it about my head, and Richard then adjusted the fabric to make it fit firmly over my eyes, shutting out every scintilla of light. That was when I felt the first goosebumps on my flesh. As I'd learnt with the ice-play, being rendered sightless is scary because you can't see what's coming; it's arousing because your other senses (hearing, smell, taste, orientation and in particular touch) are stimulated; and it's romantic, because you must place your trust in your partner.<br>
<br>
To spice things up, James asked the males to take a few steps backward, while Charlotte instructed us women to shuffle forward and choose a new partner. The men remained silent as we groped about. My hand rested on the sleeve of a ruffled shirt and I recognized it as belonging to Oscar. There were more girls than guys, so four of the former ended up paired together. They were promised that they would get to swap roles during the evening. (I was somewhat disappointed that I wasn't one of these. I might have enjoyed being tied up by a girl, and tying her in turn.)<br>
<br>
Then we began. Charlotte and James took the lead. They were still working as a couple, and she gave advice, guidance and directions to both sexes, while blindfolded and being bound. It was rather amusing, hearing our coach give her instructions in such a matter-of-fact manner, on how she was to be tied up, while she was being tied. Every so often her deadpan delivery would be interrupted by a squeal, a moan or a heavy sigh, when James hauled extra hard on the rope or wrenched her arms ferociously behind her in a too-stringent hog-tie, or when the intensity of the moment simply got too much for her to keep bottled up inside.<br>
<br>
James took over the commentary at those times when he gagged her; but she kept trying to have her say, the words coming out as mumbles, snorts and gurgles. The comical effect lightened the mood at moments when we got into more arduous poses and postures. And I marveled at the rising chorus of grunts and groans reverberating around the room, until I realized that I was part of the choir. I clenched my teeth to stifle my own noise.<br>
<br>
"Are we having fun yet?" Stephanie's voice squeaked after one resounding outburst. Everyone laughed. Then we were gagged.<br>
<br>
My attempt at stoicism didn't work; and after Oscar had pried apart my jaws and thrust the vinyl ball between my lips, I rejoined the babbling cacophony. Dribble and drool oozed from the edges of my gag, and ran over my chin, or across my cheeks or down my neck, depending on how I was trussed and tethered. Bound in a hog-tie, lying on my belly with my arms wrenched upwards behind me and my ankles rammed against my backside; displayed in a frog-tie with my knees spread part, my shoulders pulled back and my breasts thrust forward; squirming in a ball-tie; writhing in a shrimp-tie; dangling in a strappado; I tried not to be a passive prisoner.<br>
<br>
Oscar tried to soothe my spirits, stroking my head and massaging my neck and shoulders. He took Charlotte's advice when she reminded the guys that whenever possible they should wind or wrap the cord around several times, not just to make the binding more secure but to spread the pressure and prevent damage to the skin. He also did a manful job of keeping my bikini in place at times when the contortions of my limbs or the resistance of the ropes threatened its structural integrity.<br>
<br>
One compelling lesson for me was that the more restrictive the bondage the better it feels. The ropes deny you the ability to move in the space around you. Your blindfold deprives you of one sensation while stimulating others, and your gag prevents communication (except for primitive guttural sounds). But when you're cut off from the world, with your entire existence shrunken down to the confines of your bonds, your isolation becomes a connection to your inner being, as you draw on your own resources of willpower and endurance; while at the same time you are intimately bound to your partner, not physically by the rope but emotionally by your dependence on him. You discover strength in your submission, power in your vulnerability, self-reliance in your helplessness, sensuality in your suffering, delight in your discomfort, ecstasy in your agony, euphoria in your humiliation, pride in your shame, intense self-awareness in your sensory deprivation. Your thoughts are as random and chaotic as that sentence, yet crystal-clear. These are the paradoxes which make your bondage both excruciating and exhilarating — the experience of being imprisoned and yet liberated, feeling incredible arousal and unbelievable serenity. You draw energy and vitality from the ropes even as you're surrendering to their hold on your body.<br>
<br>
I had read or heard that you can become so submerged in your bondage that you zone out, you enter a languid, blissful even trance-like state. But I didn't experience that. I couldn't relax or let my mind wander. I found it impossible to separate myself mentally from the ropes. I could feel every strand, every fiber, every twist and coil during every second I was bound.<br>
<br>
The session was divided into segments, each of which commenced with Charlotte demonstrating some technique and position. Or rather, James demonstrated on her, while she provided most of the commentary. We progressed through stages of difficulty, beginning with rudimentary hands-in-front and simple behind-the-back, crossed-wrist ties. The men used supple nylon cord that felt like it had been treated with softener so it wasn't abrasive and didn't chafe or burn the skin. And while we were going through the essentials, it was obvious that many of the guys had not much grasp of the fundamentals, such as cinching to properly hitch wrist and ankle ties. It baffled me that they hadn't done research, as I had. And even though Oscar was more adept than some, as I sensed from the noises around me, I could have wriggled or kicked free of some of his first efforts. But he quickly improved, encouraged by Charlotte's reminder.<br>
<br>
"Don't hold back. If it isn't tight..." Her voice was suddenly smothered.<br>
<br>
"It isn't right," the men finished for her.<br>
<br>
Before we moved on to the more rigorous ties, Charlotte invited the males to try a few simple exercises, like having them attempt to get their elbows to touch behind their backs and trying out the "reverse prayer" position. Even without the extra stringency of rope, most were quite shocked at how difficult it can be, and by the sort of stress it puts on your shoulder blades in particular. Most gave up after a minute or so; but that didn't deter them when they put us into contorted tangles of trussed-up limbs.<br>
<br>
I gasped when my arms were wrenched behind me and bound with my elbows almost touching. This thrust out my chest until I felt the straps of my bikini top straining to near breaking point. My heavy breathing further tested its cohesion. I was sweating and trembling; my skin prickled; my nipples hardened. And that surprised me. I had not expected to be so sexually aroused.<br>
<br>
Then came the crotch-rope. We had just come out of a strappado. This had not been as severe as it might have been, but was a challenge nonetheless. Ropes were slung over the ceiling beams. My arms were bound behind me in double hammer-lock style (wrists crossed between the shoulder blades), rather than stretched out backwards. Oscar tied the suspension rope to my elbows and hauled on it until I was on my tiptoes and bent forward. He did this slowly so I could adjust to my shifting centre of gravity and adapt to the increasing strain. It was more uncomfortable than painful at first, but after a while my back and shoulders were hurting. My feet and calves began to stiffen until I feared a full-blown cramp. I was puffing and panting through my gag, hoping my ordeal would soon end but wanting to know how far I could go, how much I could take. On either side of me, in front and behind, the other girls were enduring with the same noises and the same resolve to endure. (During the entire evening, no one used her safe word or signal, and we were proud of that.)<br>
<br>
I realized how marathon runners and triathletes feel. They endure for what they extract from the experience. Overcoming adversity, pushing through the barriers allows you to go to a place where your personal power resides.<br>
<br>
After a while (I had no idea how long) the suspension rope was slackened just enough that I could stand upright but still on my toes. Charlotte was gagged, so James took over the instructing. Oscar looped a cord around my neck and ran the two strands down my front and between my legs. When he pulled it taut from the rear, it fit snugly into my creases front and back; but this was not all there was. James told the guys to tie a large knot, strategically placed to fit into the groove. It was positioned directly over my clitoris, and with even the slightest movement of my body it performed its work on me. I gulped and gasped, sucking in my spittle past my gag and blowing out bubbles which foamed on my chin and dripped onto my chest. Tottering on tiptoes, I found it was impossible to remain still; and as I reached orgasm I began to twitch and squirm, which produced a feedback of swelling pleasure. The room was full of muffled shrieks and mumbled curses.<br>
<br>
Thinking back on it, I'm sure we all overreacted; but the crotch-rope acted like a pressure valve, releasing two hours of built-up tension.<br>
<br>
James called for an intermission... well, kind of. The males retired from the room for refreshments, leaving us ladies tied in the lotus position. This involves having your legs, with ankles crossed, drawn up folded to your chest; and you are forced to bend forward at the waist until your shoulders are between your knees and your chin almost touches your heels. A rope is looped behind your neck (not all the way around, so you don't get throttled) and tethered to your ankles to keep you restrained in your balled-up position. With your hands still bound behind your back, this is a very effective arrangement because you're completely immobilized, unable to do anything except wiggle your fingers and toes. It's also very taxing on your muscles and joints. We were still gagged. My jaws ached and my mouth had run dry of saliva so my lips felt parched and cracked. A wafting draught from the air-conditioning felt clammily cold on my skin damp with perspiration. We huddled in complete silence, except for the rasping sounds of breathing through the gags. With my blindfold still in place, I felt completely alone, totally helpless. I lost track of time.<br>
<br>
When the men finally returned and I thought the session might be over, I wasn't sure if I should be happy or sad. In fact we had barely begun. There were many more positions and postures to be put into and torments to be put through, including a bout of tickle torture. For this our gags were removed and we screeched and screamed, begged and blasphemed. We were way past suffering in dignified silence. After that the bondage became more intense. I was trussed in an excruciating hog-tie with my wrists tethered to my ankles and my upper torso strapped in a yoke that tugged on my shoulders to arch my body backwards, so that as I lay on my belly I was staring (blindly) at the ceiling, making pathetic whimpering sounds.<br>
<br>
When he released me from the harness and I lay prone, my hands still tied behind my back, Oscar crouched beside me, once again gently caressing my neck, back and shoulders. In my heightened state of receptiveness, the tickle of his fingernails gliding deliciously across my skin made me shiver. I don't think he realized how stimulating his touch was, until the gooseflesh rose on my quivering body.<br>
<br>
"Are you okay?" he whispered.<br>
<br>
"Of course," I croaked.<br>
<br>
He pushed the ball-gag into my mouth.<br>
<br>
To a degree, at least, I had anticipated the physical reactions I would experience. I knew the ropes and gag and blindfold would mess with my adrenaline, endorphins and hormones. Nevertheless, my emotional response was a revelation. It was not unlike what I felt at the CMNF party. I found my bonds to be in a sense liberating, even empowering; and the stricter the bondage the more I felt this. It was that paradox again. Surrendering control, being forced and tied into all sorts of poses, some of them painful, others degrading, endowed a sense of freedom, to explore and test my boundaries and my feelings. The physical restraints relieved me of emotional constraints. How you react to something that is outside your control can define you just as much as the decisions you can and do make. The ropes acted as a channel, or a doorway, to new perceptions. Most especially, by daring to be vulnerable I discovered my strength.<br>
<br>
The bondage came to a close well after midnight. We were released from the ropes and our gags in an unhurried manner so that we could come down slowly. We remained blindfolded as our other senses gradually readjusted. I had been sightless for something like six hours, and once my vision was restored it took a while to adapt, not just to the sudden saturation of light but to the sight of the implements of my bondage and my torment strewn about. I was shocked by the deep pink grooves and ridges and faint purple bruises on my skin, on my arms, legs and torso, which hadn't bothered me until I saw them. I was suddenly aware that I stank of stale sweat and saliva, that my hair was sopping and my bikini was sodden.<br>
<br>
The walk back to Lakeside Hall permitted me to stretch my stiff limbs and flex my aching body. Richard carried my clothes. Though clad in just my damp two-piece (having lacked the foresight to bring spare underwear), I didn't mind the sharp bite of the early morning wintry air. It jolted me out of my torpor and was soothing on my skin. It was around three in the morning when we entered the lobby, and no one else was up and about to witness us all creeping in.<br>
<br>
Richard and I had the room to ourselves because Stephanie stayed on at Charlotte's place. I was physically exhausted but my brain was still buzzing. I fumbled woozily with the straps of my bikini until Richard pressed my hands to my side and undressed me. I lay passively on the bed while he made love to me with such verve that it hurt. When I woke mid-morning he was gone and Steph was just coming in. She and the others who remained at Charlotte's had resumed the bondage and did not finish until after dawn. I admired their stamina. I had been pleased with getting through my own session. Even our hostess had looked haggard as we departed. But I remember that shining through the blur of fatigue had been exhilaration, and heightened curiosity. This lingered. It was as if something had been activated inside me, a desire to further explore my limits and limitations.<br>
<br>
I never thought to ask Richard who his bondage partner had been; nor do I know how the girl-girl pairs rotated their roles. But Steph and I talked a lot about that night. She was very interested in my reactions and perceptions, to the extent that I realized she was gauging my responses. I could tell that an offer was about to be made.

<br>
After the CMNF party I was kept busy with exams and assignments. My social life, such as it had been, contracted further. While I got on well with Ben and Ricardo, they were my friends only by default. That was fine by me.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the semester ended with me feeling pleased with myself. The nagging fear that I might have peaked in high school was dissipated by good grades. My truncated social life paid off. I went home for the midyear recess in a self-satisfied mood. But when I returned things were different. Laura appeared to have become more distant — reserved and reticent, very un-Lauralike. She mixed more with her own crowd; and while she was never rude to me, it seemed like she was avoiding my company. I suspected it might be fallout from the CMNF party.<br>
<br>
But I started to blame myself, because my relationship with Caitlyn had also inexplicably cooled. I'd felt already that we were drifting apart, so I tried not to be sexist and blame feminine fickleness. I wondered if she'd uncovered my lie about the party and thought I still carried a torch for Laura. To be honest, however, I was not overly disappointed, because I hadn't expected anything serious to develop. During the three week vacation I never visited her.<br>
<br>
I decided to stay on campus for the September mid-semester break, as did many Lakeside residents. I planned to spend most of the time working on a research assignment. And that I achieved, despite a major distraction. For all over the campus the return of spring was a festive time, and on the first day of the vacation Lakesiders celebrated with a Beach Barbeque. We were a long way from the sea and the eponymous "lake" was in reality a large pond. But we embraced the other key B's — beer, board shorts and bikinis.<br>
<br>
That morning we also held our very last tute group meeting. All of us were there for the finale, sitting in a circle on the grass. It was a balmy Saturday morning. Rain that had earlier threatened to spoil the mood held off. I felt ridiculous, and Ben looked it, in our gaudy floral shirts and baggy boardies — not my usual style. The girls, on the other hand, were much more picturesque. Rachel was stunning in her canary-yellow string bikini. Michelle, whom I had never really warmed to, appeared to have shed her inhibitions with her clothing. She was much more congenial in a slender purple bandeau. Patricia had swapped her customary scruffy jeans and sweater for a butt-baring thong and a ribbon across her breasts that may have been held in place by friction alone. Kendra's athletic curves swelled a scanty leopard-print. Even our esteemed leader Lorelei was delightfully disrobed. None of the girls minded that Ben and I ogled goggle-eyed.<br>
<br>
(My roommate, who never wasted an opportunity to be obnoxious, had taunted me about missing the "Naughty Nightie" lingerie party in April. I magnanimously didn't tell him about the CMNF party.)<br>
<br>
The merrymaking began at noon, and I found myself admiring the pert élan of the Lakeside women, almost all of whom had entered into the spirit. Not all were supermodels or beauty queens, but bikinis were ubiquitous. It was not especially warm that afternoon, as the sky was cloudy, so it took some tenacity. I might even have felt bad for the women, which would have been illogical. There was no social or peer pressure. Some flaunted their assets; they strutted about and reveled in the attention. Some were shy but none seemed timid or embarrassed. And the celebration went on after the sun sank and goosebumps rose.<br>
<br>
I saw but didn't speak to Laura. She was achingly alluring in her barely-there cherry-red two-piece. As with Rachel, I had seen her in less, albeit not a lot less. But it's one of the quirks of human nature that a little clothing can be sexier than none at all. I suppose we like secrets. When something's kept hidden it's more enticing. Caitlyn was there as well, with another guy. They weren't showing any sign of romance, which consoled me a little, even if I saw no hope of rekindling our relationship. We didn't speak. I don't think she saw me in the crowd, and I didn't feel like approaching her, afraid it might end in a confrontation. But it was hard to ignore her. Her bikini-clad body shimmered in the golden rays of the setting sun. And yet there was something unsettling about the vision. For I know that sounds crazy, but below the freckles and ponytail which made her the essence of innocence, the amber sheen of her skin and its scant covering of tiny triangles subverted that image. (I guess I was having a "gift horse" moment.)<br>
<br>
The following morning I discovered that the swimsuit wearing carried on for the entire seventeen days of the vacation period. And despite becoming acclimated to the Lakeside lifestyle, there was a residual prudish part of me which found this disquieting. For I have no doubt that if the Hall had been run by "older and wiser" heads rather than its young and up-for-anything residents, such a wantonly nonchalant display of female flesh would have been curbed. Of course, that's a what-if scenario, and I cannot say that the reality was displeasing.<br>
<br>
The place was largely deserted most of the time, but those women present wore their bikinis (and a few one-piece costumes) in the dorms, the eateries, common rooms and study areas. And without the beach party pretext, some were coy at first; but before long all the ladies basked in the freedom, the comfort and the joie de vivre. So as at the CMNF party, I envied them, because they were feeling what we men were only seeing. And if that is a strange reaction for a heterosexual male with the normal range of penchants and proclivities, it helped me understand the personal paradigm shift about to change my perception of Lakeside Hall and its denizens.<br>
<br>
Now as I've mentioned, in the spirit of cooperation, as well as affordable fees, all residents were rostered for catering and housekeeping chores. First-year students such as myself were assigned light duties such as cleaning the common areas and tending the lawns and gardens. The higher levels performed more skilled or time-consuming tasks like serving in the kitchen and cafeteria, laundry detail, etcetera.<br>
<br>
One morning I investigated a noise outside my room. It was a squad of girls hauling clothes hampers. Residents left these in the hallway twice a week to be collected, so the communal laundry facility did not get congested. A few doors down the corridor, one of the workers was loading the baskets onto a trolley. She was bending over, her unadorned derrière giving my bleary eyes a treat. I was going to withdraw discreetly into my room, but as she straightened up she saw me.<br>
<br>
"Hello, Daniel."<br>
<br>
"Hi, Caitlyn."<br>
<br>
She must have been on the job for some time because she looked tired and out of breath. She managed a tight-lipped smile. Her heaving chest strained against a sliver of Lycra. She wore a g-string that was drawn snugly between her legs, revealing her intimate contours and leaving her bottom almost completely exposed. She looked breathtakingly sexy; but the Caitlyn I knew before the beach party had been more demure. That's not a criticism. It was her choice and that's okay; but it bothered me. Had she changed when we were a couple, or afterwards? Had I been stifling her true nature? Or was I overthinking this? I never found out, because I never asked.<br>
<br>
We exchanged trivialities, feeling awkward. As she picked up my hamper stuffed with clothes, she mentioned that it was nearly lunchtime. I made a lame joke I immediately regretted, that her own laundry for the two weeks could fit in a sandwich bag. She pretended not to understand, I got flustered and she smiled again, indulgently. For a fleeting instant I had the old Caitlyn back. But she returned to her toil and I went back to my books.<br>
<br>
A few days later I was having lunch with Ben and Ricardo. We were in the cafeteria and Laura was on duty clearing tables. She was characteristically spectacular, in a minuscule, mint-green bikini. She paused for a brief chat, looking a bit frazzled. Incautiously she stood between my two besotted roommates. The side-ties of her panty slung low on her hips were perilously within reach of the drooling idiots, and I started feeling some big-brotherly protectiveness. However, indomitable Laura was in full control, unflinching under their lustful gaze but with her tray poised to deflect delinquent hands. Still, she must have caught my look of concern, because she winked and grinned. There was never any danger of mischief. No one at Lakeside Hall tolerated such nonsense.<br>
<br>
In any case, my comrades were impressed when she asked where I would be after lunch. I told her: cloistered in the library. She nodded, and winked again as I ignored the silent supplications of Ben and Ricardo to be invited along.<br>
<br>
"Found you!" she exclaimed, when she tracked me down.<br>
<br>
I had no idea what she wanted; but she admonished me that I needed to broaden my horizons. Before I could answer, she asked me to follow her outside. In one of the small courtyards were sitting Kat, Rachel and three other girls I had seen at the CMNF party. They were wearing more than they had at the climax of that night, but not much more. Even after two weeks of observing bikini-clad bodies I paused to enjoy the scene. They graciously gave me time to savor the moment. All were older than me, second-, third- or fourth-year students. So now, as I gaped, I felt like a dopey adolescent caught with his porn stash by his big sister. (Is that creepy? I'm an only child.) I almost expected to get my hair ruffled.<br>
<br>
Kat beckoned me to squeeze onto the seat next to her, and as she wriggled her backside to make room she made sure that her hips and thighs — sleek and bare all the way except for the spaghetti-thin strap of her T-back thong — rubbed against my trouser leg. I saw her licking her lips, but since this was out of the corner of my eye I couldn't tell if she did it just to be provocative. Whatever; Kat was really something.<br>
<br>
Laura waited patiently, then told me about the Empyreal Society. She invited me to join. The other girls nodded, except Rachel. She had a blank look, and I realized that this meeting was for the two of us. But I at first thought it was some sort of vacuous put-on. However, that was not Laura's style. And so this is how I found myself a few nights later, standing in a hallway back in Charlotte's house, draped in a cloak of crimson, wearing nothing underneath but a buckskin loincloth.<br>
<br>
***<br>
My return to Charlotte's place revived fond memories, although this time I was more nervous than intrigued. Our mode of transport seemed quaint — a hackney carriage, like one of those black taxi-cabs plying the streets of London. Andrew, Tyler and I occupied the seats with our backs to the driver's compartment. Across from us were Rachel, Molly and Francine. We hardly spoke, deep in thought and having second thoughts. The light was on but our eyes never made contact across the narrow gap.<br>
<br>
We arrived shortly after sunset and James met us at the door. He was dressed eccentrically, in a puffy-sleeved, white silk shirt and shiny black trousers, with an ornate leather and silver-stud codpiece. He also wore a floor-length, bright red cape fringed with gold tassels. It was hard to hold back a laugh, but he grinned good-naturedly. He took us down a corridor which led from the living room. This had an eerie, almost creepy quality, in contrast to the chic suburban ambience of the rest of the house. The walls, floor and ceiling were colored in shades of red, the carpet was so plushly soft that it felt squishy, and the dim lighting reduced everything to a pink tinge. One of the girls whispered something. I think it was "vagina", and that image got stuck in my head.<br>
<br>
The passageway opened into a large, well-lit room, and there we were greeted by the congregation. The males were attired identical to James but with customized codpieces. The latter accoutrements ranged in design from understated to comical to grotesquely phallic. The females had on white dresses in individual patterns, short and long, snug-fitting and loose-flowing, but all décolleté — off the shoulder — and each wore about her throat a black leather choker embellished with a pink rosette.<br>
<br>
Everyone, maybe forty in all, wore harlequin-style half-masks, also personalized but revealing enough face that I could identify most of the people present. Charlotte was there, naturally. So were Laura, transcendent in a shimmering satin slip dress, Kat and, to my surprise, Ben's sister Emily. They formed a large semi-circle, in no particular order, with us novices clustered at its focus. James intoned a few sentences, none of which I recall, but there were no other formalities or rituals before Charlotte beckoned the six of us to follow her to an adjacent chamber. This was bisected with a bamboo screen. She directed Andrew, Tyler and me to the left of the panel. There was a table on which were three neatly folded capes, like that worn by James but without the golden trimmings. Next to them were three breechcloths, of mustard-colored buckskin with leather belt.<br>
<br>
Andrew said something in a hushed voice that I didn't catch, and before I could ask him to repeat it Charlotte's voice resonated over the top of the partition.<br>
<br>
"Yes, everything!"<br>
<br>
I'd suspected this would be the case. Even so, the three of us felt, and looked, more than a bit silly. The sparseness and dullness of the loincloth contrasted with the size and crimson vibrancy of the cloak, which when draped over the shoulders hid all of our torsos but for a strip down the middle. And as we stepped back into the main room, I saw that the three girls wore similar red mantles but were naked underneath. Each held her arms in a way that the cape was drawn back on her shoulders to expose her breasts and pubes.<br>
<br>
I found myself pondering how sexist was the difference between us guys and the girls. I berated myself, thinking once more of a gift horse's mouth.<br>
<br>
As we re-entered the main room, Charlotte lowered the top of her dress to her waist. I looked across to where the rest of the Society members were gathered, and all the women had already done the same. None of them seemed self-conscious being topless. Andrew and Tyler made audible sounds of pleasure. Somewhat prepared by the CMNF party, I managed to keep quiet.<br>
<br>
I'd anticipated some sort of elaborate ceremony, with initiation rites, mystical sacraments and other nonsense. Instead our induction was very informal — notwithstanding the outlandish "uniforms" — and light-hearted, in keeping with what I learned was the philosophy of the Society. We were treated to a brief disquisition from James and Charlotte, who alternated at apparently random points of the presentation.<br>
<br>
The name of the Empyreal Society refers to a celestial realm of light and creative energy, existing above and beyond the mundane world: "There are many happy sights in the inner heavens and many paths along which travel the fortunate gods, each doing their own thing. You can always follow if you are willing and able, for jealousy has no place on the celestial stage. But when you go to the banquet and festival, you ascend the heights of the Empyrean." This is from Plato's Phaedrus. Accordingly, the motto of the Society is "De gustibus non est disputandum — "There should be no arguing about tastes."<br>
<br>
(The Society loves its classicist pretensions. My only quibble was the barbarous mingling of Greek and Latin.)<br>
<br>
The guiding philosophy of the Empyreal Society is that pleasure, in the form of satisfying intellectual, spiritual, physical and sensual desires, in no particular order, is the highest good and the proper objective in life. It is therefore the right of each individual person to freely choose his or her lifestyle insofar as it is mutually consensual with and not hurtful to others. And I could go more into Empyrean ideology; but there's another old saying — "The devil is in the detail." In truth, its practical expression was a form of hedonism with a strong emphasis on sexual themes. The members justified this focus as the most primal and fundamental but also the most sublime of humane pursuits. I never took this rationalization seriously. In any case, that one condition of admission was a medical exam including a check for "all communicable diseases" was an unambiguous clue about what to expect.<br>
<br>
The rest of the evening passed unremarkably. I still felt goofy in my ridiculous garb. At least, unlike the female neophytes, I had something covering my genitalia; but they didn't seem to mind; and those codpieces were just plain ludicrous. Many of the other women — by no means all but including Laura — stayed bare-breasted throughout. But it was all more sedate than the CMNF party (and therefore the naked boobs seemed, to me, rather gratuitous).<br>
<br>
However, two weeks later we returned to Charlotte's place. We wore normal clothing. The capes and other accessories were for inductions. In fact, on arrival we discovered that there had been another such occasion, to which I and the other novices hadn't been invited; and one of the latest inductees was Caitlyn! She blushed as we met outside the house, and avoided me after that. But I could tell that she wasn't hostile, nor embarrassed, just taken aback by my presence. And perhaps irrationally I resented that, as if poor dull Daniel could never get himself involved with the Empyreal Society.<br>
<br>
Charlotte and James convened the meeting, again taking turns to speak, as if to emphasize their equality. Most of the members nodded throughout the presentation, which was obviously directed at us newbies. We were introduced to what the Society actually did. Charlotte called their activities the "empirical" expression of their philosophy; and it took me a while to recognize the play on the word "Empyreal". My excuse for my slow uptake is that the things we were told were distracting, to say the least. I remained skeptical, as if the whole thing might still be some elaborate joke. The events of the following summer would have erased my doubts... but I didn't have to wait that long.<br>
<br>
With the formal meeting concluded, there was an hour of casual conversation. Then suddenly, on a cue from Charlotte, the women took off all their clothes. I would have been almost blasé. It's amazing how quickly your mind can adapt. Anyway, having learnt the true focus of the Society's activities I could hardly be surprised. Nevertheless, this was my first sight of Caitlyn naked in public; and I was rather disconcerted that she appeared undisconcerted. This was especially so since once again we males remained covered up; and even if nobody else seemed to regard this as an issue, it troubled me. Of course, one could write long essays on gender construction, how female and male nudity are perceived differently, etcetera. So perhaps to avoid the mental effort I convinced myself that my misgivings were simply more prudery.<br>
<br>
And yet there was a curiously austere, anaesthetic, unseductive affectation in the girls' nudity. Make no mistake, it was erotic, but it felt like we were in a role-play game. The girls might have been playing characters, divorcing their experience from in-the-flesh reality, the same way in a video game you can immerse yourself in the virtual world while still looking in from the outside — "This is not my real body; it's my avatar." As a result, the nudity had an almost sterile quality. There were no fetish items like stiletto heels, fishnet stockings or garter belts, just raw sexuality in a bizarrely banal setting.<br>
<br>
But then it got surreal. As the six new female members from the two inductions were blindfolded, Charlotte led us six new guys to the smaller room. In the middle were five cosy armchairs, arranged around a queen-sized bed with lilac-colored sheets of silk or satin. Charlotte tied a blindfold over her eyes and then pointed in the direction of where we six were standing. No words were spoken but we understood. The nearest to the straight line from her finger was Andrew. I was glad it wasn't me. She shuffled towards the bed, and when she made contact she lay down, on her back with her legs spread. Andrew knew what was expected, but hesitated — not out of reticence but unsure if he was supposed to undress. So she patted the mattress and all he did was unzip his trousers and lower them halfway to his knees. As he lay on top of her I looked away. The rhythmic squeaking of the bedframe and squishing of the mattress gained in tempo. He grunted and she moaned as their climax was reached. Yet without foreplay or any aftermath, the sex was brief and mechanical, more a ritual than an act of passion, not what I associated with a group that celebrated pleasure-seeking as the highest ideal.<br>
<br>
When Andrew had finished and stood up, looking sheepish as he fixed his trousers, I jumped to my feet. It wasn't that I was eager to go next. I felt squeamish about inserting myself into a vagina filled with several other guys' semen. (Indeed it shocked me that condoms weren't used, even more than the fact that this impressive, desirable woman was inviting half a dozen men quite a few years her junior into her body one after another.)<br>
<br>
I knelt on the mattress between Charlotte's thighs and fumbled with my trouser fly. Her lips curled into a smile as she pushed away my hands and completed the job, drawing down my pants. Her own hands were cold, but as I lowered myself onto her body it was warm as the blood rushed through it. When I pushed into her and began to pump, her breathing and heart rate increased dramatically. I could feel both through her heaving breasts. She licked her lips and blew out rapid-fire puffs of air. I peered at where her eyes were hidden behind her blindfold, wondering what she was thinking, and feeling. In other words, was she really being turned on? She lay passively, her legs never changed position, she rarely used her arms; so she was exercising formidable self-control.<br>
<br>
Immediately that I felt my semen gush into her I stopped thrusting. The deed, so far as I was concerned, was done. I didn't feel sated or gratified or contrite, but instead jaded. Whereas Charlotte seemed still fresh and earnest — which was a good thing, because four young men were awaiting their turn. As I lifted myself off her, I impulsively put my fingers into her vagina. It was hot, and moist from her own juices as well as Andrew's and my fluids. Charlotte didn't react. I ran them up her belly, over her breasts and around each nipple, across her throat and to her mouth. She sucked them but kept her teeth clenched. I caressed her cheeks and her blindfold. She now went tense, and for an irrational few seconds I thought I'd gone too far. But I realized that it was my show of tenderness which caught her off-guard. For as I crawled off the bed she stroked my arm in a gesture of acknowledgement.<br>
<br>
As with Andrew, I didn't watch the other guys having their way with her. When it was Oscar's turn she started gasping. He was grinding her pelvis. He may have been insensitive but I think he was just clueless. Jonathan was rougher; and even so my impression was that none of us guys really knew the ins and outs of pleasing women. We were what no young guy wants to admit — rank amateurs.<br>
<br>
So I didn't feel good about any of it. It was a numbing, almost depressing experience. My takeaway was not elation or gratification, but rather awkwardness, remorse, even shame. Which should have made no sense. Charlotte was the one lying naked on the bed being fucked by six tyros. Yet she enjoyed it physically. At the end she seemed none the worse for the wear and tear but remained mentally detached (except for that brief moment of subtle intimacy when she touched my arm). But I think that was the point. We were being tested — we males, that is, even if an outsider might conclude it was Charlotte. As I had already discovered, first and superficial appearances meant nothing.<br>
<br>
And if what I've just written makes no sense, this describes my experience in a nutshell.<br>
<br>
As we went back to the main room it occurred to me that every male present had been inside Charlotte. The women were still naked. (I was hardly affected by that now.) The six new girls, no longer blindfolded, gave us funny looks and stared at sweaty and disheveled Charlotte. So at that moment my feelings of self-reproof returned. I searched Laura's face for a sign of reproach or disappointment in me. Her inscrutable expression told me nothing but that she had seen all this before.<br>
<br>
I don't know how the new girls had been consecrated into the Empyreum. I never found out because nobody talked about it. Initiations are usually an ordeal. I don't know why this has to be so, except that when you go through a lot to attain something like membership of a group, you value it more highly than if your admission had been easy. But in our case it was more about seeing how far we were prepared to go. More importantly, and ominously, it was a means of inducing conformity and guaranteeing secrecy. Certainly I had ventured into places where I would never have dared or desired to, before that night.<br>
<br>
Yet for the next two months the gatherings of the Empyreal Society were almost conventional, even genteel affairs. Wilder parties were held weekly in Lakeside Hall. There was one more initiation, to which we neophytes were not invited, of all girls I was told. That being said, the real game was yet to be played.<br>

<br>
The drive from the campus took around two hours, although I could not be exactly sure. I lost track of time staring silently out the window, watching the houses rush by, then farms and fields, marshy scrubland and finally dense forest. We were travelling close to and parallel with the coast, and through breaks in the trees I caught fleeting glimpses of the ocean's leaden glaze under an overcast sky. The only sounds I heard were the steady drone of the engine, the dreary hum of the tires, the dull, doppler-shifting roar of passing traffic, and from my seat near the back of the bus some of the conversation from the five young men occupying the rear bench. The nonchalance of their words was belied by the tremor of excitement in their voices.<br>
<br>
None of us women (thirty altogether) spoke. It wasn't that talking was prohibited. We were preoccupied with our thoughts. We sat with our hands under our thighs, between our legs, palms down, wrists crossed, as instructed. Our panties were bundled at our knees, and our skirts were pulled up so our backsides were naked against the upholstery; and the first touch of the vinyl, cool and slick, against bare flesh had been oddly titillating. I must have gasped because Francine, next to me, gave me a smug look, as if this was nothing new to her, or she was too tough to be affected. But all around us there were soft sighs of pleasure. Each time we hit a rough patch of road or rounded a bend, I felt a delicious tingle as my skin peeled away from the seat and clung again as I sank back down. It was weirdly erotic; and with our senses already heightened by exhilaration and apprehension, none of us could suppress the occasional gasp and moan. But our muscles started to cramp (not painfully, but unpleasantly) because we had to lean forward slightly, maintaining a stiff posture, to keep our hands in place beneath our thighs. Francine began to whimper and squirm, and I found some guilt-edged relief from my own discomfort in hers.<br>
<br>
After a while my eyelids drooped, my mind went fuzzy. I'd spent weeks preparing for this, mentally and physically. I even stepped up my exercise program. However last night, knowing I would not sleep well, I had gone to bed early. That was a mistake. I lay awake through the hours, contemplating what lay ahead. Now I was starting to suffer the consequences. Francine was also beginning to nod off. As the bus veered off the highway, she lolled sideways until her head was almost in my lap.<br>
<br>
We turned onto a narrow, winding, rutted road, and that roused me from my stupor. The woods closed in, and the rumble of rubber on asphalt was replaced by the crackle and crunch of macadam. The vehicle slowed but began to swerve and shake and rattle. We were jolted and jerked. My skin became goosebumpy. I felt the adrenaline surging through me. My breathing quickened. The tickle inside me built to a throbbing thrill. We pulled up at an iron gate. The driver alighted to open it. The gate was sturdily built and flanked by a grimly high barbed wire fence. Once we were through, we continued on our journey for a few more minutes before slowing down to cross a rickety wooden bridge over a narrow stream. As we did so, a few of the girls started whispering.<br>
<br>
These were the first words any of us had uttered since our departure. Just a short distance away was a group of a dozen or so women. They were working on the edge of the creek, constructing a small dam. Some were digging and chopping, others hauling timber and pushing barrowloads of rock. Apart from sun visors, gloves and work boots, they were naked. Perspiration glistened on begrimed bodies which bore crisscrossed pink streaks. Each wore a thick leather collar; some, though not all, were shackled hand and foot. They discreetly lifted their heads and squinted at the bus as we went by. I knew most of those faces, strained by fatigue, smeared with dirt and sweat. Supervising them and languidly watching us pass from the shade of a flamboyant poinciana were two young men who relaxed on deck chairs, sipping drinks. Unlike the toiling women they wore clothes.<br>
<br>
As we gazed upon this tableau, the murmur on the bus increased, but not from the males, who had contrarily gone silent. Though not unexpected, the scene was confronting, a daunting reminder and a tantalizing foretaste of what lay ahead.<br>
<br>
Once we had climbed out of the gully we could no longer see the creek, the slaves and their masters; but through a gap in the greenery I caught sight of a sprawling estate. Beyond undulating meadowland loomed an imposing Georgian-style mansion. Four stories high, its stately scale and symmetry were deformed somewhat by a soaring, Gothic-style tower affixed to the east wing. We drove on, down an increasingly uneven road, until the bus lurched to a final halt in a clearing on the summit of a small hill. I could make out, in the distance, a cluster of low, white-painted buildings crouching atop a squat plateau. Recent rain had turned the surrounding fields into a gorgeous palette of vibrant colours — emerald-green grass, delicate white jasmine, lavender bellflowers, pink and orange gazanias, scarlet geraniums. On a terrace off to our right cattle grazed placidly. To the left were orchards and vegetable gardens, tended by several more nude women.<br>
<br>
Enthralled by the scenery, I took a moment to notice that Francine was not sharing my interest. She was in the window seat and staring downwards. I shifted my attention. Standing on the gravel next to the open door of the bus were two men. There were dressed alike in khaki trousers and maroon shirts. Ominously tucked into the belt of each was a length of cane. One of them made a gesture and our five travelling companions rose from their places and sauntered down the aisle. Glances were exchanged with us females, seated in silence. They thanked the driver and disembarked, fresh-faced and wide-eyed, trying to conceal euphoria behind façades of causal calm. They were greeted with formal salutations and a cordial follow-up.<br>
<br>
A few paces astern were four women, bare-skinned but for leather collars. With heads bowed, they stood with their arms folded behind their backs. Their bodies were slim but shapely, toned by an austere regimen of diet, exercise and hard labor. The skin hues of three were deepened by exposure to the sun, and showed no hint of tan lines. Their hair was tied back severely. The fourth had silky-smooth mahogany skin and glossy black, ornamentally woven locks. Each woman bore on her breasts, belly and thighs faint pink stripes and fading bruises like the marks on their sister slaves down by the creek. (I must confess, that made me cringe.) In the sunlight which shone through the scattering clouds onto their loins glinted silver rings which pierced their labia.<br>
<br>
Because they were staring at the ground, it took me a moment to identify two of them. Elegant, enigmatic Claudia and audacious, avant-garde Laura were the cerebral and sublunary doyennes of the Empyreal Society, the woman of ideas and the woman of action. Their postures reflected their natures and motives. Claudia held herself in a rigid, disciplined pose. She had a delicate, brunette, blue-eyed beauty that made it hard to tell her age — probably late twenties. The exemplar of self-possession and sophistication, at Lakeside Hall she was like a housemother, always cool, sympathetic and soft-spoken, yet decisive and resilient. So it was something of a shock to see her so servile and wantonly displayed. But she truly believed in the hedonist philosophy of the Empyreans. Laura looked stressed, as if wanting to break free. She fidgeted, raising and lowering herself on the balls of her feet; but she could not suppress a wry smile. Laura was both charming and intimidating. She had a sugar-and-spice look of softness that was belied by a steely — one might even say flinty — persona. For her, I'm sure, all of this was a game and she was playing a role not much more extreme than her other devil-may-care adventures.<br>
<br>
Once they'd disembarked the new Masters inspected the four women. The latter were older than any of the males and most of us waiting on the bus, a couple by several years. Each performed a graceful curtsey, keeping her eyes lowered as the males studied her body. One of the senior Masters (Brandon by name) said a few words and, in front of Laura, traced with his finger one of the pink lines which ran along her torso, diagonally across her right breast and down her tummy. He made a joke. Jonathan and Tyler smirked; Daniel and Andrew grimaced; Oscar's expression was deadpan. I filed their reactions in my brain as useful information for the future. But Laura flinched and Brandon pulled his hand away.<br>
<br>
The new Masters performed a double-take as they examined one of the slaves, the statuesque dark woman. She was proud, the only one of the four who lifted her head (if only for an instant) to return the men's scrutiny. She had the sleek lines of a gazelle, and like a gazelle's her eyes flitted about, as if constantly alert for predators. I looked harder and recognized her. Justine was a celebrity athlete. She was also a doctoral candidate at the Academy of Sport. But she'd traded public acclaim and Olympic gold for pubic silver, the thrill of the race for the sting of the whip. Next to her, the fourth woman (whose name I've learnt is Danica), was sultry and sensual. I hadn't seen her or Justine at Empyreal gatherings, but I could be sure that, like the others, she had impressive credentials.<br>
<br>
And even after my experience with the Empyreal Society, knowing what to expect, it felt strange seeing these women as they were now, humbled slaves, their naked bodies defiled, meekly awaiting orders from their lords. Yet though docile they were not degraded. Their bearing was one of humility but not shame. Each stood erect, impassive and inscrutable, drawing back her shoulders, pushing out her chest and thrusting forward her pelvis, in a silent, self-assured affirmation of her womanhood. The message was clear, not just to those of us still waiting on the bus but to the five neophyte Masters. It was a reminder that in the weeks ahead, the stars of the show would not be those who wore the clothes and wielded the whips.<br>
<br>
I realized that these were odd thoughts to be racing through my head. But my senses had been honed. I could feel the unease emanating from the novice Masters. How bizarre, I thought, that they should feel so unsettled. After all, their summer would be a time of privilege, enjoying the service and obedience of their slavegirls. But they were aware that it would be, in an important way, more a trial for them than for us. My test would be one of endurance, and I knew I had the stamina to pass it. Theirs would be one of self-control, of deciding how far they could push their authority without crossing an invisible, imprecise boundary, of understanding the difference between Master and martinet. And that was what felt so weird. I and my fellow slaves were nervous, but juiced up, by what lay ahead for us. Our newbie Masters were just nervous.<br>
<br>
That's when I knew I had made the right decision. I was determined to not just endure the impending ordeal but to embrace the experience. I would not only be testing my own limits, I would be proving myself to my fellow slaves and to my Masters. Indeed, still sitting on the bus, I was getting turned on just thinking about the formidable challenges ahead. It was, in a way, flattering, to have been chosen, to have been deemed strong enough for this adventure. Beside me, Francine was breathing more heavily now. And I'm sure that all thirty of us had similar thoughts swirling through our minds and similar feelings surging through our bodies — dread and arousal.<br>
<br>
My musings ended. The bus driver abruptly spun in his place and ordered us to "Get up. Strip." He faced to the front again but watched us through the rear-view mirror as we took off our clothes. That was easier said than done. There was not enough room in the aisle for all of us, so some had to use the seating space as well. We bumped and jostled and there was the occasional giggle as we undressed; but no words were spoken. I folded my skirt and blouse and underwear and placed them on my vacated chair. I lay my sandals upside down on top. The others were doing the same. Then, awaiting our next command, I gazed wistfully at the neat, forlorn pile, my last connection to the outside world.<br>
<br>
It surprised me that we had to strip on board the bus. I had not expected our initiation to come so quickly; but it was better this way, for anticipation is often more excruciating than the event itself. It was also our first practical lesson about the Summer Commune. Once she had touched the sanctified soil of the compound, a woman was forbidden to cover any part of herself. During my time here I would not be permitted to wear anything on my body. I would be on display; but our nudity meant more than providing a visual treat for our Masters. It was a reminder, to them as well as us slaves, to both sexes, of what we are and what we are not. But it also made us more accessible, more vulnerable. I shuddered.<br>
<br>
"Line up and stay quiet," the driver growled, not bothering to turn around. Selena, at the very front of the line, took a cue from someone outside and clasped her hands behind her head. The rest of us followed her lead. To fit our entire column in the narrow confines, we packed our bodies together until our contours dovetailed. It was an intimate squeeze. My face was buried in Jessica's hair. I could smell her vanilla-scented shampoo. Francine's bosom nudged between my shoulder blades. Her flesh was warm and moist, the nipples were hard. I could feel her rapid deep breaths and even her quickening pulse through breasts quivering with anticipation.<br>
<br>
There was a long delay as the Masters conferred. They joked and laughed, occasionally staring up into the bus, at their females waiting silently and patiently in our compact queue. Finally, one of the men went to speak to the women standing by. The slaves nodded, keeping their eyes downcast. Laura and Danica moved forward to the storage compartment under the bus and hauled out the five men's luggage. They loaded the bags onto a hand-cart standing by. For the rest of us newcomers, besides our discarded clothes there were no belongings. "All you have, all that you need, is what you are," we had been told.<br>
<br>
With the air conditioning switched off, it quickly turned hot and stuffy in the congested aisle. Our naked torsos pressed together became sweaty and sticky. Perspiration trickled off Francine's breasts and dribbled onto my buttocks, seeping into the crevice. It was a weird experience, to be compressed like that, motionless and silent, sniffing and sharing each other's exudations. The only sound was that of breathing and the occasional muted cough, the only movement the shuffling of bare feet starting to ache on the corrugated floor. Even then we kept as still as possible. Whenever I felt tempted to make a noise or shift my position, I admonished myself that we were not here just to please the Masters but to test our own commitment to the path we had chosen.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, there was a mutual sigh of relief when we were ordered off the bus. We shambled forward, and when I reached the lowest stair I hesitated, for only a second but fighting back a sudden panic, before stepping down. Without the use of my hands (still clasped behind my head), I could not utilize the railing to ease my descent onto the hard ground, and a twinge of pain through the unprotected soles of my feet was my introduction to the Commune. I also could not shield myself from the men's gaze; and though I should have been inured by our evenings at Charlotte's home, I felt more goosebumps creep over my skin.<br>
<br>
The Masters watched us come out. They appeared blasé, and though possibly feigned their indifference was unnerving. If our nudity didn't animate, it was because they had other ways to amuse themselves with our bodies. I shivered.<br>
<br>
As Laura and Danica began towing their cart with the men's luggage towards the white buildings in the distance, Claudia and Justine ushered us thirty into a line along the side of the bus. They used gestures rather than words to keep us bunched up in a single file.<br>
<br>
When we were all assembled, it was one of the Masters who commanded us to turn to face the side of the bus. We stood shoulder to shoulder, stiffly erect, our hands now behind our backs to close up as much as we could. We still spread along one side and the rear of the bus. The seven males and the two slaves then moved along the line, binding our arms. The new Masters were not gentle, but I suppose that was due to inexperience since they were slower at the task as well. It was Justine who took hold of my wrists and got me to grasp one fist in the other. She looped a leather strap around my upper arms.<br>
<br>
Jessica to my right grunted. From the corner of my eye — I dared not turn my head — I saw that the Master binding her, Jonathan, was making her strap too taut. She began to groan, and I could sense that the young man was becoming flustered. It seemed that he'd put the belt too close to her elbows and had pulled so hard that he could not release the buckle to adjust it. He vented his frustration on it, and on Jessica. Claudia politely intervened and fixed the problem.<br>
<br>
"Thanks," he muttered.<br>
<br>
Claudia did not respond, moving to the next girl. It seemed to me a good thing that a Master was willing to accept help from one of his slaves; but it was a reminder that just as we new slavegirls were here to learn, so were the new Masters. The men's education would be the women's tribulation. I found myself trembling at the thought, and could not decide if it was trepidation or elation that I was feeling. Most likely it was both.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Justine shackled my wrists with leather bracelets. My arms were now pinioned in such a way that I could not flex or bend them. The cuffs were connected with only a single link, so my hands were locked tightly together, stressing my arms and shoulders. But having your elbows trussed actually eases the strain on your wrists; and as a bonus it accentuates your breasts (for a display pleasing to the Masters). We were standing close enough to the bus that when I swayed a little, my teats grazed the side panel. To my surprise the metal felt ice-cold. Perhaps that was my imagination; but the shock sent a ripple along the entire length of my body. I only just now realized how sensitized I'd become, how stimulated I was as I waited, naked and bound, to be marched to the Compound and into servitude.<br>
<br>
And I was appalled that my nipples were hard and erect. I could not hide my feelings. But there was something else. It was the same with the four veteran slaves. It seemed that they were in a constant state of arousal, like a permanent orgasm. That wasn't surprising; but it had to be an exhausting, exasperating and embarrassing way to spend your days and weeks. Well... I would find out.<br>
<br>
Next came gags and blindfolds. Justine, from behind, gently prised my lips apart with her fingers; but when I opened my jaws she shoved in a latex ball, and secured it, wrenching my head backwards, with a leather band fastened at the back. The shiny crimson orb filled my mouth and protruded slightly. Immediately saliva began to collect behind it, but I couldn't properly swallow. And because the gag did not form a perfect seal with my lips, the drool soon began to seep out, trickle down my chin, dribble onto my chest and ooze between my breasts into my belly button. Noisomely evocative, the ball-gag's violation of my mouth and my dignity was another of the weirdly erotic sensations (like bare skin on a bus seat and nipples against cold metal) which you can never be fully prepared for.<br>
<br>
Yet my blindfolding came almost as a relief. Justine tied a black satin sash about my head. There is something oddly calming at being sightless, and the cool, soft fabric also had a soothing effect on my flushed cheeks. But at the same time your other senses are enhanced. The fragrances from the flowers in the nearby field were intoxicating. So were scents from the other girls — perfume, shampoo, deodorant, perspiration blending in an exotically sensual aroma.<br>
<br>
We were commanded to left-turn, rearranging ourselves from row into column, and we closed up until we touched once more. Having naked bodies pressed front and back against mine was already becoming familiar. The manacled hands of Jessica, now to my front again, were wedged into my crotch, and down there I could feel a growing exhilaration. She was feeling what I felt in Francine behind me — breasts swelling, nipples hardening, loins becoming warm and wet. It was another wonderfully erotic sensation, to be bonded so snugly with my sister slaves.<br>
<br>
We were then yoked. From what I could tell a single long rope was used, into which were tied loops at short intervals. These were placed over our heads and constricted about our necks, like a noose but with a knot to prevent choking. When that was done, one of the men gave the order to move. As we began to shuffle down the slope, we remained huddled, to keep from straying off or falling on the meandering path; and the feel of the other girls' bodies pressed against mine was also, in a way, reassuring. Selena was probably still at the head of the queue, and blindfolded like the rest of us. In later drills the lead girl would be steered by a leash, so I guess that's how we were being guided.<br>
<br>
In any case, the Masters had spaced themselves along the outside of our column. There were seven of them to escort their thirty slaves. They each brandished canes, which they employed to urge us on whenever we slowed, or someone faltered or stumbled. All that was normally needed was a poke, but the occasional yelp meant that sometimes more incentive was required. A couple of places ahead of me I heard the squeaky voice of little Stephanie, albeit distorted by her gag. She squealed more than most of us, so I pictured her having a rough time. But she's high-spirited, so was doubtless being obstinate.<br>
<br>
We were heading down the hill, and when we reached the base and the ground levelled out and the path straightened, we were prodded by our Masters to increase the spacing between each other, stretching out our tethers which were of about half an arm's length. This allowed us to move a little faster without tripping over each other's feet. We maintained our bearing blindfolded by keeping the rope taut and feeling for subtle tugs skewed left or right. Wherever the path curved, one of the men stationed himself there and tapped us with his cane to herd us in the correct direction. If any of us took a misstep or misjudged her tempo, we bumped into each other. The offender received a sharp whack and so did the girls on either side. This was the only time I felt the sting of the cane, and was proud that I never wavered.<br>
<br>
So it was hard going. We did not march. We shambled along, puffing and panting through our gags, trying to maintain our pace and rhythm from behind the black satin sashes, our arms and torsos sore and muscles beginning to cramp from the stringency of our bonds, our jaws aching from the inserted crimson balls. The pebbles of the pathway jabbed our bare feet. The sun now made only fleeting appearances, but it was a hot and humid day, and there was not a single gust of wind, so the sweat dripped off our bodies. By the time we reached our destination, we were enervated... and elated.<br>
<br>
We had arrived.

<br>
We heard about the Summer Commune just days before the year's final exams. I have no doubt that the timing was deliberate. We had enough important things on our minds without thinking too much or too deeply about what we were told. So when I signed up I really didn't have much of a clue what it was all about.<br>
<br>
With just a week to go I started having second thoughts, and expressed these to Laura. She gave me a long, hard look and explained the situation. When she finished it was my turn for the long, hard look.<br>
<br>
"I don't get it," I said.<br>
<br>
She seemed surprised. "What's to get, Danny?" She rarely called me that.<br>
<br>
"What's the catch?"<br>
<br>
"There's no catch. You can't just accept it?"<br>
<br>
"Would you?"<br>
<br>
"Fair point." She laughed. "But I thought you understood what the Empyreal Society is all about."<br>
<br>
"I do; and I can see why you want to try this... experience. It's what you've always done, pushing your limits. It's why I've always thought you were, I don't know, special."<br>
<br>
She began to stammer. I think she thought I was fishing for a reciprocal compliment, so she stopped and I went on. "I'm just not sure what role we -- the guys, I mean -- have. It seems, well, one-sided."<br>
<br>
She smiled. "Don't be so self-absorbed. It's not about you."<br>
<br>
"That's what worries me."<br>
<br>
She shook her head. "That's you, in a nutshell Daniel, always looking the gift horse in the mouth."<br>
<br>
"Is that a mixed metaphor?"<br>
<br>
She ignored my question. Then came the revelation.<br>
<br>
Having known Laura most of my life, it was foolish of me that it took so long. "It's a game, isn't it? We're playing roles..."<br>
<br>
"Now you're getting it." She leapt to her feet and started to walk away.<br>
<br>
"That's it?" I called after her.<br>
<br>
"So you're in?" she said, looking back over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
"Of course," I growled. "Never said I wasn't."<br>
<br>
And so I was one of those who gathered at nine o'clock in the morning, at a spot behind Lakeside Hall where a bus was parked. Charlotte and James got us organized; but the only other members of the Society present were the newbies. Laura, for example, I hadn't seen for several days. The girls outnumbered the guys six-to-one. Rachel was there, of course, as was Caitlyn. We didn't speak to each other. No one said much, to nobody's surprise.<br>
<br>
The girls boarded the bus first. Charlotte followed them, there was an interval of a few minutes before she disembarked and James said "Go to the rear, fellas."<br>
<br>
Once we were seated there were no spare places. I don't know if had been planned that way, our numbers exactly right for the capacity of the bus. There were five of us males in the back. (Marcus, the sixth rookie, had for reasons unknown to me opted out.) As we moved down the aisle I noticed something odd about the way the girls were seated. Only when I passed Caitlyn and took more than a glance did I realize that they were sitting with their bare flesh on the upholstery. All had, apparently, been told to wear a dress or skirt. This was pushed back, and each girl's panties had been pulled down to her knees. Caitlyn saw me staring and blushed.<br>
<br>
"Well, this is going to be interesting," I thought. I guess I'm the lord of the understatement.<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
As the girls shuffled in single file along the path leading to the compound, my job as a master -- fancy that, a master! -- was to keep them on track, steady and if necessary upright. Bound, gagged, blindfolded and tethered, and naked, they puffed and sweated and whimpered, and I felt guilty about having to occasionally prod one of them with my cane. But my fellow masters, Oscar and Jonathan in particular, were more severe. Every girl received at least one hard whack across the backside, because it was impossible for them to not falter at some point in their march.<br>
<br>
I felt relief, though no doubt less than our slavegirls, when the slow-moving column finally reached the compound. This is a large rectangular area. A mess hall is located at the eastern end next to a smaller building that contains the administrative offices and the infirmary. On each of the northern and southern sides of the compound are six wooden barracks. Between the two rows is an open area about the length of a football field and a third of that wide. The huts are solidly built and well-maintained, but sit on a surface of compacted sandy loam with only a threadbare pretense at a lawn. The western end of the quadrangle is open. From here a path leads down the slope of the small, flat-top hill into a broad valley.<br>
<br>
Around two dozen women and three or four masters were working at various tasks in the compound. The men wore the same uniform of khaki trousers and maroon shirt, and every one carried a cane tucked into his belt. Their slaves were, it almost goes without saying, naked. (During my entire time in the Commune I never saw a female body with any covering at all. When I travelled home at Christmas for a family get-together, it felt strange seeing the women wearing clothes. A mental image of my mother and aunts snapped me out of that.)<br>
<br>
The thirty new girls were sorted into six groups and led off, still in their bonds, to the huts. We new masters went to the mess hall, where we were treated to a short, somewhat pointless address by Brandon, one of the guys who met us at the bus. Technically there was no hierarchy among us males. Decisions were generally made by vote if not by consensus. We wore a uniform, but that represented unity and equality, not regimentation. Obviously there were individuals with special expertise whose authority everyone recognized; but otherwise, there was no particular reason why Brandon had this assignment. Anyhow, I took an immediate dislike to him. His manner was irritating -- grim-faced yet slightly pompous. The real briefing was delivered after his speech.<br>
<br>
Olivia had been standing at the back of the room. Amidst all the gorgeous women in the Empyreal Society, she was a spectacular stand-out, tall and slim, sensuously curved with not an ounce of surplus flesh. Soft-spoken and refined, she had lucent sky-blue eyes and delicate features with finely sculpted cheekbones. Her golden-blond hair was cropped short. Her vulva was a pastel pink flush beneath a gossamer of tawny tufts and curls; and as on her fellow slaves her labia were pierced by a silver ring. I knew her from the Society, as a medical doctor pursing a postgraduate degree.<br>
<br>
Naturally I saw her naked at my first Society meetings. Most of the female members seemed unaffected, almost blasé about their nudity, and Olivia epitomized their casual composure. She looked so at ease and innocent that I felt a bit sordid gawking at her. We had a conversation about the history of medicine. It was a subject she was passionate about, and she began waving her hands around, causing her breasts to oscillate in a most distracting way. I started to gibber and jabber and felt ridiculous. Yet only later did I realize that she didn't have a clue why I was all of a sudden blathering -- or she hid it very well. That she thought I was an idiot and not a pervert made it extra embarrassing! And that's the point. Back then her nudity had been a proud proclamation of her feminine strength and dignity. Now it was a symbol of her submission.<br>
<br>
I should have been baffled at seeing Olivia as she was now, not just exposed but meek and obeisant; but since Laura introduced me to this lifestyle nothing much could surprise me, least of all what I was learning about myself.<br>
<br>
She came forward, keeping her hands behind her back. When she began speaking, she made sure to keep her gaze lowered towards the floor, occasionally glancing up but never making eye contact with any of her audience. Her talk was skilfully presented, as advice rather than as a lesson, since it would be highly inappropriate for a slave to lecture her masters. I had no idea how she would handle having to answer questions, especially dumb ones, but no of us had any.<br>
<br>
The session lasted for the better part of an hour, and when it was over Claudia, who was one of the oldest slaves and very much like Olivia (elegant, enigmatic, perceptive), asked us to accompany her outside. Five women were waiting, including Laura. She came up to me, head bowed but with a faint smile and said "Please come this way, Master."<br>
<br>
It was the first time I'd been called that... and it came from Laura! I started to say something in return but the first word came out as a rasping croak, so I shut my mouth.<br>
<br>
Despite my mental preparations and my experience so far, I was finding it hard to accommodate mentally to this version of Laura, so sweetly servile. I'd known her too many years to be fooled that this was anything other than a game. But as someone once told me -- and yes, it was Laura -- if you immerse yourself in your role-play, if you faithfully follow the rules, as she and her fellow slaves did, it becomes indistinguishable from, it is real life.<br>
<br>
I followed her to one of the huts on the northern side of the quadrangle. The L-shaped interior is about the size of a large living room. The décor was spartan, with bare wooden floorboards and lighting provided by three windows, and at night by naked bulbs hanging from a low ceiling. Crowded along one wall were eleven narrow bunks almost touching, and four more occupied the opposite side. Each had a mattress and pillow but no sheets or blankets. The only other items of furniture were two cabinets, a bin and an armchair. There are two other doors. One opens onto a concrete deck with bathroom facilities. The other, on the opposite side of the hut, leads out into the quadrangle. Between the rows of beds a small room served as my personal quarters.<br>
<br>
Six girls from the bus were already inside, each standing at the foot of her bed facing the wall, staring straight ahead, completely still and silent, stiffly erect except for the occasional twitch -- they would have been like this for an hour -- legs slightly apart, arms folded behind her back. Each wore a leather collar. Because the windows were shut it was hot and humid, and their bare skin glistened with perspiration.<br>
<br>
"Turn around, please," Laura said to the girls. It wasn't a command. In the Commune all slaves were equal in status and service, those who were long-term members of the Empyreal Society and those who -- like me -- were naïve neophytes. So slaves didn't give orders to slaves. They transmitted the masters' orders and instructions.<br>
<br>
The girls about-faced, and as they did so bowed their heads. Each appeared to pull back her shoulders to push out her chest. On cue the first in the line intoned, softly, "Slave Caitlyn here to serve and obey you, Master."<br>
<br>
I sucked in a breath. This as such a different Caitlyn from the girl I had known as both girlfriend and ex-girlfriend. I detected a quaver in her voice and wondered if she was afraid that, in my newfound position of power over her, I would get revenge for our break-up. She must have known I was not that petty; but power does change people. More likely, it was humiliation, and I confess that this aroused me. Indeed, I felt a little ashamed that I'd chosen her for my "harem". But I'm human, after all. I wanted her to lift her head, to make eye contact so we could have the sort of connection we once enjoyed. I could have commanded her to do so, but that would be giving away my thoughts, and more importantly my feelings.<br>
<br>
The second girl could not conceal a smile though she kept her gaze directed at the floor.<br>
<br>
"Slave Rachel here to serve and obey you, Master."<br>
<br>
We had come a long way since our first tutorial group meeting nine months before. Oddly enough, I was still the apprentice, or at least that's how I felt. For both of us it was our first time in the Commune, but she appeared so calm, so self-possessed, whereas I was tingling with nervous energy.<br>
<br>
The other girls introduced themselves -- Francine (haughty and passionate), Jessica (high-strung and impulsive), Layla (plain-spoken and impetuous) and Stephanie (tiny and free-spirited). It was a ritual. I already knew them. I'd had a part in the assigning of all the slavegirls to the five huts; but I'm convinced I got the best deal with my fifteen. For as long as we were in the Commune, I would be responsible for their welfare and discipline. They were, for all extents and purposes, my property, and that felt weird. The sudden realization of the weight of duty I'd assumed bore down upon me. How much had changed in my life -- and my slavegirls' -- in so short a time!<br>
<br>
These were, without exaggeration, the most beautiful women I could ever hope to meet, intelligent and accomplished as well. The oldest, Claudia, was ten years my senior; Sarah and Emily several years. (I was unsure how much my roommate Ben knew about his sister's involvement in the Empyreal Society, if he was even aware of its existence. I don't think he would have made a decent master. Yet for that matter, Oscar and Jonathan were not much different. I hoped I would be.)<br>
<br>
Each of these remarkable women had her reason for being enslaved. Some were masochist, no doubt. Most were like Laura, testing their limits and limitations, searching for the most extreme experiences. And oddly enough, that gave me a hollow feeling. Though I would control their existence, and they would obey and serve me without question or hesitation, I knew that I was no more than a vessel for the fulfilment of whatever fantasies, challenges and desires had brought them here. Because I hadn't earned my privilege; I was interchangeable with a thousand guys. My only qualification was to be born with a penis, to possess what my slaves, for all their other attributes with which I could not compete, did not. My only test would be one of self-restraint. I would have to repress the very passion to which the girls had submitted. Rather than their master, I felt like their minion.<br>
<br>
Maybe I was overthinking this. In any case, what Laura did next changed everything, forever. It was a small gesture and I suspect not part of the ritual, just an impulse. She knelt before me, bent forward and kissed my feet. She remained in that position until I stroked her back. She rose and went to stand before her own bed, breasts and pelvis thrust forward. I noticed for the first time a glimmer between her thighs -- the silver ring piercing the lips of her vagina, a barrier and a signpost at the entrance to her body.<br>
<br>
She knew exactly what she was doing, as did I. She was redefining the relationship we had shared for almost two decades, in which I had always been the junior, and not just in age. The temple of Laura still stood firm, indeed more glorious, more proud, more dazzling than ever. But I was now the high priest...<br>
<br>
"Damn!" I shouted to myself. Were those thoughts really mine? I was glad that all other eyes in the room were fixed on the floor, because I could feel my face reddening.<br>
<br>
I retreated to my room. My bags were just inside the door. Modest enough, my quarters were luxurious compared to the girls', with a proper-sized bed, a cupboard and a desk, furnished and equipped for the privileges of my sex, with space for my clothes and personal effects, which the slaves were not permitted to have. My uniform of black trousers and maroon shirt was laid out on the bed. Affixed to the wall was a plaque. It was inscribed with, of all things, a Biblical quotation -- "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded." In other words, with power comes responsibility. I hoped desperately that I could live up to the trust which these women had placed in me, that I could reciprocate with benevolence the unconditional service and obedience to which they had committed themselves.<br>
<br>
Claudia's voice politely interrupted my musings.<br>
<br>
"Please, it's time to go, Master."<br>
<br>
"Thank you, slave," I replied. I quickly changed into my uniform.<br>
<br>
I left the hut, left the seven girls each standing in silence and the end of her bunk. It was bright outside. The clouds had dispersed, the sun was beating down. It occurred to me that it was still just early afternoon.<br>
<br>
"Let the games begin," I murmured.<br>
<br>
Claudia heard me and smiled.

<br>
The day begins for us slavegirls officially at sunrise. We don't need a clock. As the first few awaken to the early birds' chorus, they nudge those still sleeping on either side. This morning I am one of them. Our bunks are narrow and crammed together, so I can reach over and touch Caitlyn. She twitches and grunts. I prod, she sighs and sits up. On the other side, Francine brushes away my hand and emits a mournful whimper.<br>
<br>
We affix our collars, tidy our bunks and exit the hut, all done quietly so as not to disturb Master Daniel, slumbering in his den. It's light enough outside to begin our chores. The eastern horizon glows a mellow gold. Venus shines virginal white in the violet haze above, while the Dog Star still gleams in the western sky. We gather in the quadrangle. Girls are also coming out of the other huts and assembling. We stamp our feet and swing our arms. Although we haven't worn a stitch of clothing for twenty days, we are not yet inured to the bite of the dawn chill on our bodies.<br>
<br>
I don't think any of us mind being up and about so early (except Sarah, who is not looking well). It's a lovely time of the day, not least because we don't have to deal with any of the Masters. That wouldn't be a real problem (after all, it's why we're here), but it's nice to take a break. Yet this is not a time to relax and socialize. Claudia assembles the hut leaders to give out assignments and instructions to the group leaders. Tasks are mostly the same each day but rotated among the five hut "harems". The work is not onerous apart from kitchen duty; and this morning my group is on "prep" -- setting up the equipment and materials for the morning's activities. We collect cans of paint, brushes, rollers, scrapers, knives, buckets, ladders, tarpaulins, etcetera, from the storage shed, and set them in stacks beside each of the huts. So we know what today's big job will be.<br>
<br>
Before we begin, however, there is a matter to be taken care of. Four girls march into the middle of the quadrangle and stand rigidly to attention. One of them is Regina, from my hut. Claudia consults with Olivia, our resident doctor, then nods to Donna and Eliza, who step forward, their arms laden with heavy chains. These are locked onto each of the four girls' wrists (in front) and ankles, and then linked to another chain which is attached to her collar front and behind. It runs down her chest and belly, between her legs and up her back. It is of a length that she has to stoop forward slightly to prevent it gouging her crevices. Each will spend as many days shackled as is warranted by her transgression. Regina spoke back to a Master, which is not a serious offense, so she will probably spend just two daylight periods working, eating and bathing in her restraints. But it's not her first time, so the penalty may be more severe. She examines her fetters, shakes her wrists as if testing for weakness. Meanwhile incorrigible Katrina, who is used to wearing chains, caresses them. With a cheeky grin she stands bolt upright so the chain between her thighs tightens into her cleft. Some of the girls watching her wince.<br>
<br>
The preliminaries take half an hour, towards the end of which a few of the males have emerged from the huts and are making their way to the mess hall for pre-breakfast coffee. They pause, briefly, to stare idly at us as we begin our chores. That's when we cease any talk, straighten ourselves and quicken our tempo. We don't acknowledge the men's presence and take care to not make eye contact. But one of them, Jonathan this time, amuses himself by playing with us. He stands in the passageway between the mess hall and the administration building, blocking our path.<br>
<br>
"Excuse me please, Master," we say in turn, keeping our eyes downcast and the irritation out of our voices. While interfering with our work is frowned upon, it's not forbidden. After three weeks, however, I would have thought they'd be tired of the game.<br>
<br>
Groping is also discouraged, at least of the unauthorized kind. But Jonathan positions himself so we have to turn sideways to edge past him. My breasts brush against his shirt. He pretends not to notice, and his expression doesn't change; but the same happens with Jessica who flinches and Caitlyn who grits her teeth. Layla doesn't balk. She presses her naked chest and hips against his; and while keeping her head bowed she ostentatiously licks her lips. His face begins to redden. Coming after her is Stephanie, weighed down with two heavy paint tins. She squeezes against the wall of the building to avoid touching. I see her subtle smile; but it's enough that she will likely and Layla will definitely pay for their insolence. And while we don't always enjoy our punishments, we savor our acts of defiance, however petty and futile.<br>
<br>
Breakfast begins at seven o'clock. The girls from H block are on kitchen duty. The men arrive intermittently over the next hour. There is a row of tables in the middle of the hall and for them dining is an informal affair. We, the slaves not serving, eat in two shifts, at tables placed at one end of the hall. For us there is no chat and no lingering over coffee, and no choice of what we eat or don't. (As our physician and dietitian, Olivia insists that we never skimp on meals.) We take pride in sitting erect and silent, maintaining our discipline. We don't look up from the table, even at each other.<br>
<br>
(We sit on wooden bench seats. For no reason other than picayune malice, and to remind us, as if any reminding were needed, of our status, the cushions have been removed and our bare bottoms rest on the bare wood.)<br>
<br>
Once we've eaten we return to our huts for a spruce-up prior to resuming our work. After all, slavegirls must look their best when toiling in the summer heat. We have time for just a quick grooming; but we must present ourselves always at our visually appealing best. There are cabinets with the complete range of toiletries -- soaps, toothpaste, pads, perfumes, powders, deodorants, creams, balms, lotions, shampoo, clippers, razors, etcetera. The sole personal items we're allowed are contained in a pouch containing a toothbrush, tissues, tampons and sanitary towels. Tampons are preferred for hygiene because they permit an unobstructed view of our genitalia. Of course, this is more important for us, the slaves, than for our Masters. The males have plenty of female flesh to gaze upon; but surrendering that last bit of intimate space to public view serves as another potent token of what we are and what we are not.<br>
<br>
And on that topic, most of the girls are smooth down below, and these have chosen epilation over depilation (that is, long-term over short-term removal). I am in the minority. I have kept some of my pubic hair, albeit trimmed and thinned to a gauze of wisps and curls. However, in another respect natural beauty is the desired mode. For missing from the usual feminine accoutrements is make-up -- no rouge, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, nail polish, perfume.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, sunscreen is compulsory for all outdoor activity, in lotion and spray form rather than cream (for aesthetic reasons). For health and safety, when on work duty we have headgear and footwear, though with nothing in between except our collar.<br>
<br>
Then it's back to the mess hall; but we line up outside, along and facing the front wall, in the usual posture with feet slightly apart (because knees should never be pressed together) and arms folded behind our backs. We wait there, staring at the timber, joined by the second breakfast shift, for another half-hour. It's tiring and dreadfully tedious, with no talking or movement permitted. This is one more of the gratuitous burdens imposed on us, serving no purpose but discomfort and humiliation. I occupy my mind reciting song lyrics in my head. Eventually, however, everyone marches off, leaving just Olivia and me.<br>
<br>
The infirmary occupies a wing of the administration building. Master Andrew is waiting for us in the office. I first met him in the first aid class, when he was a junior student, I a senior and Olivia the teacher. Now the roles are reversed. Although he's the least qualified of us in medical expertise, he possesses what Olivia and I do not, so he's in charge. It's a strange dynamic. Theoretically, she must ask his permission for everything she does; but most of the time his role is standing back to observe and ratify Olivia's doctoring decisions with an occasional nod.<br>
<br>
"We have a patient," he says.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Master," she replies.<br>
<br>
In the treatment room, Sarah is perched unsteadily on the edge of the bed. She's tiny (even smaller than itsy-bitsy Stephanie) and looks more fragile than ever. Her face is a ghastly pale as she offers a feeble, apologetic smile. She starts to get to her feet when Andrew enters; but he waves a hand and she gratefully sinks back onto the cot. Olivia diagnoses migraine, and Sarah painfully nods in agreement. It's not her first attack. She's embarrassed to be a nuisance (as she calls herself) and is worried she will be sent home. Olivia reassures her that it hasn't reached that stage; but she's in no condition to work and will be spending the day under observation. I feel awful for the poor girl, who is normally so full of obstinate spirit. Yet there is a moment when I can smile and reflect on the weirdness of our situation. Olivia draws a sheet up over the patient's body, and Sarah flinches. It could be the unfamiliar sensation of fabric on her skin or the opprobrium of having her body covered in the presence of a Master; most likely both. In any case, he doesn't seem to mind.<br>
<br>
We haven't received any other patients by mid-morning. (There have been no serious issues in the three weeks so far, just upset stomachs, trivial infections and a couple of minor injuries.) Olivia has paperwork to complete: updating records and inventory, and so on. Andrew can assist, and because a slave cannot be redundant or remain idle, I go next door to help out in the kitchen. The fifteen girls of Hut H are busy cleaning and preparing lunch, watched over by Master Oscar. He's lounging in a camp chair in the middle of the room, sipping an iced drink, studying the bare backsides of a half-dozen slaves kneeling around him scrubbing the floor. He casually acknowledges my curtsey as I enter, then points to Cassandra, who is scouring the tiles near his feet. She's one of the oldest slaves in the Commune, ten years senior to her imperious Master. She passes a sponge across to me without looking up. Beside her, Lucinda wiggles her bottom as she scrubs, reveling in the Master's gaze.<br>
<br>
All the girls are sheathed in a glaze of perspiration. I feel a bit guilty that my morning has (so far) been easy. Master Oscar, of course, looks relaxed and comfortable, enjoying the privilege of the penis. Getting bored, he goes over to where the rest of his troupe are making and wrapping sandwiches. Among these is Alice. Quick-witted and temperamental, back on the campus she's a brilliant student, studying postgraduate mathematics. Notwithstanding her petite stature, she has an intense, intimidating stare. She's also Oscar's sister. He joins her standing at the bench and slaps her backside. She doesn't react except to hold up a sandwich while staring straight forward.<br>
<br>
There are four sets of siblings in the Commune. Layla and Katrina are sisters. But I must confess that I still feel a little queasy about the notion of a brother and sister in a master-slave relationship. In fact there are three such pairings, the others being Amanda and Andrew, Hannah and Nathan. In each case she is the elder, and that at least makes sense. A guy would be too protective of a little sister for her to be allowed to properly fulfill her duties. But I cannot imagine what it's like to be the slave of your baby bro.<br>
<br>
Around noon the Masters arrive sporadically at the mess hall, accompanied by the women they've been supervising. We in the kitchen grab nibbles between serving them. But halfway through Master Paul selects half a dozen of us to take refreshments to the slaves working on the dam. We're laden with backpacks containing food and drinks and other supplies. The delivery, which could have been done in a few minutes by vehicle, takes us thirty. It would have been even longer, but we use a short-cut via a forested ridge which skirts the mysterious Georgian mansion. For no good reason (but the Masters need none) we are hitched to each other with a tether joined to our collars, an arm's length apart.<br>
<br>
As we leave the compound, we pass the girls from H block. Not yet called to lunch, they are working alongside some of the Masters, painting the end hut. The morning work detail is one of the few occasions where you may see both sexes sharing the load, except of course that the males are in charge. The Masters wear overalls to absorb the paint spatter. For the girls there will be much mutual scrubbing and scraping in the showers this evening. Emily sees me and in a whisper asks about Sarah. The other girls look up. Master Daniel starts to reprimand her but thinks better of it.<br>
<br>
"Okay," I respond, with a thumbs-up and an encouraging smile.<br>
<br>
They go back to work.<br>
<br>
Once we're ascending the ridge, Master Paul doesn't mind if we talk. But the climb is difficult because the track is steep, and after the latest rain slick with mud. My shoes are not designed for hiking, and as I slip and slide I'm too focused on staying upright to maintain a conversation, and getting quickly out of breath. My backpack is heavy. I must be carrying more than just lunches. Up front, leading Eliza on a short leash, Master Paul urges us to go faster. Since he's not burdened like us, it's easy for him to pick up the pace. Still, I'm not aggrieved. He could be more considerate, but it's his privilege to not be.<br>
<br>
The day has turned hot and humid. The threat of a thunderstorm looms on the western horizon. Inside the forest, however, it's pleasantly cool. Water drips from the canopy and runs in tickly rivulets down my body. The giant leaves of elephant ears laden with raindrops droop across the path gently slapping my breasts, belly and thighs. It's nice being bare-skinned. (Well, it's never not nice; it's part of being a slavegirl. I mean it feels good in the tactile sense.) Even so, by the time we reach our destination I'm puffing and sweating.<br>
<br>
The fourteen women on the site are not working on the dam itself but clearing debris from the side of the road that leads to the rickety bridge we crossed in the bus. The creek is flood-swollen and fast-flowing, so they are keeping well away from its banks. Nevertheless their bodies are plastered and faces smeared with slimy, foul-smelling muck. Incorrigible Katrina is still in her chains and, I'm not surprised, is also gagged. I and my fellow beasts of burden deposit our loads and take out the sandwiches, fruit and juice. I finally discover what else we've been hauling: tools of all types. The walk back should be easier and quicker.<br>
<br>
The two men in charge greet Master Paul. Their clothes are impeccably clean. After a few minutes they command their slaves to line up and kneel on the grass, awaiting permission to eat. They do so in silence, with heads bowed, taking prim little bites, and I wonder if they're stretching out the time. Katrina looks stricken as the others begin, until she is allowed to remove her ball-gag.<br>
<br>
The six of us who brought the food squat nearby, still tethered. Master Paul approaches Gabrielle. He unhitches her from her leash and she stands up. He touches her chin to raise her head, but she keeps her eyes lowered. He inserts a finger under her collar and leads her away, to behind a thick patch of shrubbery. A moment later we hear moaning. When they emerge there is still leaf litter adhered to her back and bottom. He kisses her and she returns to her place with the rest of us. (This might be disturbing to anyone who doesn't know they've been in a relationship since long before she introduced him to the Empyreal Society.)<br>
<br>
Master Paul confers with the other men and they call for Roxanne to join them. As in the infirmary, there's a peculiar master-slave dynamic at the dam site. Roxanne is a qualified civil engineer. She is therefore the unofficial manager of the project. The two young males are nominally in charge, and her instructions are channeled through them. Sometimes other Masters come to provide extra hands, and it gets more complicated. But Roxanne is very astute, able to have her say and her way while maintaining proper humility. She receives her orders and organizes her sister slaves to collect their tools and stow them in a metal shed near the dam.<br>
<br>
All twenty of us are now commanded to line up. Those not shackled or carrying packs have their hands tied behind their backs. Then we move off, heading back over the ridge to return to the compound. Roxanne leads. The thirteen whose hands are bound have to cope with the swishing of the leaves and branches that have invaded overgrown parts of the track. While there are no ticks or venomous snakes around these parts, leeches are lurking ready to attach themselves to unprotected flesh. We have lots of that; but this time we all emerge unscathed, unsucked. Katrina hobbles along in her chains at the rear of the column, trying to keep up and dreading a Master's cane... or not; it's hard to tell with her.<br>
<br>
But the three men seem to be trailing a long way behind, out of range of sight and hearing; and we soon realize that they're not following us at all. They've detoured for some reason, maybe heading down to the mansion. So for the first time in quite a while we are free from male supervision. We keep up our pace, but we're able to chat and joke, mainly about our Masters' facets and foibles. Gabrielle receives some good-natured teasing.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Roxanne calls "Hush!" As our column goes quiet we hear, filtering through the trees and bushes, shouting, laughing and squealing. We are nearing the compound.<br>
<br>
"Oh great," the girl behind me groans. "The fun's begun!"<br>
<br>
On the field below the plateau everyone has gathered for the games. There are, altogether, a hundred people in the Commune. Slaves outnumber Masters three to one. I don't know the selection criteria because in the Empyreal Society as a whole the sexes are roughly equal in number. The women are proportioned as thirty novices (serving our first summer in the Commune), thirty trainees and fifteen veterans or "graduettes". Only five of the twenty-five Masters are rookies. They are assigned to the five huts, each supervising fifteen women (with three graduettes, six trainees and six novices). The other Masters reside in huts which each house four men despite being the same size as ours.<br>
<br>
The event in progress is a sort of chariot race. The chariot, really a litter, is a triangular frame of sturdy wooden poles carried at the corners by three women, who are wearing bit-gags. It is ridden by one of the Masters who perches rather precariously in the middle. The course is a long figure-eight. As the rider urges on his struggling bearers, on the curves it is easy for him to lose his balance and fall out. He then has to climb back onto the frame as the girls strain their aching muscles to lift it, with his weight, back to waist height. At the end of the race they collapse and after a few heats the ground is strewn with exhausted naked bodies. Of course, to win a heat and advance through the run-offs means they will have to drag themselves to their feet and draw on their last reserves of energy. You have to be fit and unflinching to be a slavegirl in the Commune.<br>
<br>
One of the Masters comes and speaks to Roxanne. I think he's asking what's happened to our three supervisors. She shakes her head. He directs us to drop our packs, sun visors and shoes in a pile, and then take up a position, remaining in our line, near the race course. I'm worried, being dog-tired, that we are going to be drafted into the game, but fortunately we're able to sit it out, as spectators. The women from the dam site still have their hands tied behind their backs, and now we six are bound as well. To my dismay, Oscar and Tyler do the deed. They're not exactly sadistic, but they relish their authority over us more than most of the Masters. Oscar wrenches my arms behind me and is rough trussing my wrists with a leather strap. He manages to fondle my breasts and my butt as he's doing so. We are all then ordered to kneel.<br>
<br>
Katrina, naturally, gets special treatment. One of the Masters grabs the chain that runs down her front and drags her across the field to where the other three shackled slaves are squatting. They are not permitted to rest on their heels, and so they are red-faced and swaying from the pain and fatigue. If any starts to totter she is prodded with a Master's cane. Pride as much as the fear of a stinging whack keeps them from falling over.<br>
<br>
The races, meanwhile, go on. Master Matthew's team, which includes athletic Justine, crushes the competition. Everyone takes a fifteen-minute break. The girls are even permitted to sit together and talk. And when a couple of the men come over and untie us nineteen, we know it's time for the next game. It's race day, apparently. All the women are involved except Sarah, who is allowed to sit and watch.<br>
<br>
This event could be called Crabs and Worms. The circular course is not very long, but we complete two circuits. On the first we move like a crab, facing upward, hands and feet on the ground. It's a great way to firm up your arms, shoulders, abdominals, legs; and doing it nude puts all those healthy bits on display. The second time around we crawl on our bellies. The grass is short but prickly, and I dread that I'll be itchy for the rest of the afternoon. It's humiliating, and meant to be. (The games are supposedly not just entertainment for the men but part of our training. Layla's sardonic "So what have we learned, ladies?" a week ago earned her a day in chains alongside her sister.) I wonder about the older women, Claudia, Cassandra, Justine, Olivia, Roxanne: how many degrading things they've been put through, how they cope, whether their motivations are the same as mine.<br>
<br>
We all do our best to win, though there are no prizes and a victory in the heats ensures a second ordeal and even a third in the final rounds. You don't spend your summer in the Commune if you're a quitter. So I'm pleased with myself that I reach the semi-finals while content that I don't make the last four. Not unexpectedly, Justine again wins the competition.<br>
<br>
As a bonus event, the four chained girls hobble forward onto the circuit. They cannot crawl or crab-walk, but are not excluded from the fun. They complete the race on their knees and Katrina is puffing heavily past the edges of her ball-gag. She still manages to force out an "Is this the worst you've got?" laugh. I cringe. You can only take taunting so far.<br>
<br>
More games have been scheduled, but a darkening sky and ominous distant rumbling intervene. The Masters confer and declare a halt to proceedings. We slaves are sent to get cleaned up.<br>
<br>
The ablutions block adjoins the sleeping quarters. It is spartan in design, with a bare concrete floor and three shower heads in a single stall. The two toilet pedestals sit side by side rather than in separate cubicles. There is no privacy. This appears to be deliberate, because empty hinges reveal where doors had once been. The toilet seats are screened from the outside by an interior wall, but when we shower anyone can stare in at us. And I guess it shouldn't really matter since we are nude all the time anyway. But it's another reminder us that we have willingly forfeited our right to modesty.<br>
<br>
(Master Daniel uses the facility as well; but to preserve his masculine dignity he does so alone.)<br>
<br>
Our cleaning must be quick but thorough. We shower five at a time, our bodies squeezed together under the three nozzles. We're all grubby from the games; there's dirt and grass and lord knows what else in my creases; and the other girls have dried paint to scrub off. Squashed in beside me is Abigail. She's gorgeous, witty and satirical, and a wonderful example of "erotic plasticity". Her sexual orientation can change by the hour or depending on whom she's with. Refusing to admit to being straight, bi or gay, she's "flexible". And now, under the sensual stream of warm water she's flexing my way. "Your turn," she coos once I'm all-over sudsed. As I begin to begin to apply the soap to her torso, Layla steps into the cubicle to make up a threesome. Laura and Emily exit graciously, to give other girls a chance to join the fun. (They're not opposed to these dalliances, just not in the mood.) Our shower-stall shenanigans are the only opportunity we have, while enslaved, for an intimate relationship on terms of equality. And for most of us, what happens in the Commune stays in the Commune.<br>
<br>
We can hear the storm approaching as the thunder grows louder and more frequent. Just as the last of us is safe and dry in the hut a mighty torrent pounds the roof.<br>
<br>
Even with the afternoon's programmed activities cancelled, we don't get free time. Claudia announces that all slaves are confined to their huts, except those on kitchen detail. In a way that's good news. The Masters have gathered in the mess hall for whatever they have planned to occupy their time; but it won't involve us. We get a break from being their entertainment; but that doesn't mean we put our feet up. We each stand at the foot of her own bed, mute and rigidly at attention, arms behind backs, facing towards the wall and staring directly ahead. After three weeks I've become used to this. You learn how to relax your muscles while keeping a stiff posture, and you devise mentally stimulating routines for warding off what can become excruciating boredom. Today these are crucial because we maintain our positions for perhaps two hours. There is some inevitable shuffling of feet, stretching of muscles and neck exercises, but no one speaks or moves from her spot. During lulls in the rainfall it's so quiet I hear the breathing of Francine and Caitlyn on my left and right. Even our live wires, Layla, Abigail and Stephanie, maintain their silence, knowing that any breach of the rules will get everyone punished.<br>
<br>
Sarah, still pallid and frail, has the dispensation to lie down but chooses to join us in the line-up. Notwithstanding her brevity of stature, she's one of the toughest slavegirls in the Commune. Like many of us, she is here to test herself with outré challenges. She has no intention of being the first girl to be sent home, willingly or otherwise.<br>
<br>
It must be around five o'clock when sunlight breaks through the clouds, brightens our barracks and, more important, warms our bare bodies. Master Daniel enters. We reflexively straighten up. He calls out Layla and Stephanie. They follow him out the door. They, and we, know what's coming -- retribution for their feeble display of defiance towards Master Oscar this morning. Daniel returns shortly afterwards and gives us permission to lie on our bunks. We are off our feet, but it's not for relaxation. Every moment we spend in the Commune is defined by our slavery. Our sole purpose is to obey and serve the males, and bad weather is no excuse for us to take it easy. I prostrate myself, on my stomach, legs spread, hands folded behind my back. The posture makes it impossible to doze off. My chin rests on the pillow so I'm still looking ahead. We mustn't see each other's faces, because we are forbidden to communicate in any way.<br>
<br>
The sun is setting when we are called to dinner. We march in a single file to the mess hall. We are the second shift and the men have already finished their main course. The four chained girls are prostrate on the floor beside the Masters' tables. Layla, Stephanie and Delilah (I wonder what she's done wrong) are beside them, hogtied with rope. All are gagged and blindfolded. We take our seats and the women from H block bring out our meal. It's delicious and nutritious, a colourful chicken salad with more ingredients that I can count. We eat, as usual, in silence, and can listen in on the Masters' conversation if we so wish. I wish not to. Sarah picks at her food, and I'm worried that she's still not well. Claudia glances across the room at Olivia, who is watching from a corner, and encourages Sarah to keep eating.<br>
<br>
As soon as dinner is over, Olivia and I go back to the infirmary. (Sarah comes along and insists she's improving.) We complete the daily inventory check, and Andrew arrives just in time to sign the report. He doesn't read it or ask questions. He's just there because... well there's no need to restate the obvious. But he does inquire about Sarah, who appears indignant that she is still being fussed over. Then Master Dion enters. He and Olivia exchange nods and she takes a carton from one of the cabinets. He says "Make it an even dozen" and she counts out twelve condoms.<br>
<br>
A couple of minutes later I peek out the window. Eight Masters are each heading to a different hut, leading a slave on a leash. One of the latter is Sabrina. Sophisticated and cerebral, with a laconic spirit and an ethereal blond-haired, brown-eyed beauty, she might be the last woman you'd expect to find in a summer camp for slavegirls. She's never explained what motivates and fortifies her.<br>
<br>
Some of the eight women will spend the night with their Masters. Others will be sent back to their barracks. The condoms will not necessarily be used. All slaves, at the beginning of our service, are encouraged to begin a course of contraceptives, and a supply of pills is kept in each hut. However, being available for sex, or not, is one of the few expressions of free will we enjoy, during the first four weeks in the Commune; and most of us forgo it, even those with boyfriends among the Masters. They don't, as far as I'm aware, resent being deprived of that pleasure.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the evening activities have started. Once she has closed up the infirmary, Andrew ties Olivia's hands behind her back, then does mine. We return to the mess hall where the tables and chairs have been stacked at one end. All the slaves are similarly bound and kneeling along and facing the walls, except for half a dozen; these are standing in the middle of the room inside six circles of Masters, blindfolded, their hands clasped behind their heads. In each circle, a cane is being passed around, and each girl receives whacks on her back, buttocks and thighs from each Master. They are not full-blooded blows. The Master holds the cane against the skin, draws back the tip and lets it go, raising a pink welt but not breaking the skin. Nevertheless, it's scary to behold before Olivia and I take our places against the wall awaiting our turn. When we can no longer see the action, we can still hear the gasps and sighs.<br>
<br>
The cane is rarely used for punishment, rather for discipline, in other words what might be called "training purposes". It's also not a nightly thing -- not necessarily out of benevolence towards us, but to give lesions time to heal for the next session.<br>
<br>
When I am called to enter one of the circles, Laura, Caitlyn, Claudia and Jessica are also summoned, as well as Olivia (since the other women of her Hut F have already had their turn). Jonathan unties my hands and blindfolds me. I take my place surrounded by the six Masters. I clench my teeth as I feel the cane come to rest on my bottom. When it lifts away I brace myself. I imagine I hear the swish as it rebounds and connects. That's unlikely, but I do hear the "Thwack!" and I certainly feel the sting. I've been through this several times, and it doesn't really hurt. The pain is in the indignity of having to stand there, naked, surrounded by males as they violate my flesh. That's balanced by the pride I feel in not flinching or crying out.<br>
<br>
The cane now rests on my back, just below my shoulder blades. I don't know if it's a good thing to have a second's warning of what's to come. Being sightless, I have no idea who it is wielding the cane each time. In fact, this strike is not much more than a tap. That's not good. It's why a merciful Master can be bad news for us slaves. Jonathan sneers "Why don't you just kiss her?" and someone else adds "Try again." Naturally, the gentle-hand overcompensates. I cannot hold in a groan.<br>
<br>
"That's better," someone mutters.<br>
<br>
The cane caresses my thighs. I don't know who it is taunting me. I'm still paying the price for that half-hearted effort which earned me a bonus whack. But I'm feeling strong. I get through my ordeal, nineteen strokes altogether, unwavering, and wondering if any of my tormentors could do better. My hands are once more tied and I am sent back to the wall.<br>
<br>
Sarah does not avoid her caning, though she could. The four girls in chains are also not exempt.<br>
<br>
We slaves are sent to our huts while the Masters stay behind to plan tomorrow's activities. During the brisk walk across the quadrangle I look up. The sky is ablaze; Sirius and the stars of Orion glitter overhead; a half-moon is sinking in the western sky. I would love to linger, but that's not allowed.<br>
<br>
Regina, freed from her fetters at least for the night, joins us, looking haggard. We assume the usual position, standing to attention at the foot of our bunks but with our arms still pinioned behind us. Just after we do so, Sabrina comes in. As she takes her place, Layla whispers something. I think it's "So, good, bad or ugly?"<br>
<br>
Then comes a non sequitur from Stephanie. "God, I could make love to a cheeseburger right now."<br>
<br>
Sabrina replies, very uncharacteristically, "Not for me, thanks. I'm all full up."<br>
<br>
Claudia, at the other end of the row of beds, hisses "Shush!"<br>
<br>
So we wait, not making another sound, until Master Daniel arrives, maybe thirty minutes later. He goes from bunk to bunk freeing our hands. Then he settles down to read in the armchair outside his bedroom; so we have another long wait. We're allowed in batches of three to wash ourselves and use the toilets. When it's our turn we each call out, still facing towards the wall, "Permission to use the bathroom, Master?"<br>
<br>
"You may, slave," he replies.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Master."<br>
<br>
Finally we can finally go to bed. I take off my collar and place it at the foot of the mattress. I lie on my belly because the skin of my back, buttocks and thighs still smarts from the caning, not much but enough that I'm aware of it and don't want it to stop me getting quickly to sleep. I have no sheet or blanket to cover me, since it's warm inside the hut. However, there are some in one of the cabinets in case the weather gets unseasonably cold.<br>
<br>
"Good-night, girls," Daniel says as his door closes.<br>
<br>
"Good-night, Master," his harem of fifteen answers as one.<br>
<br>
As the room goes dark, all I hear are the breathing noises from my fellow slaves. It's a comforting sound, gradually dying away until I'm one of the last still awake.<br>
<br>
My twenty-first day in the Commune comes to an end. There are eight days left before we go home for a four-day Christmas break. Then I must decide. Will I return? If I do, that's when the real fun begins.

<div style="display: inline;"><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; padding: 20px;">Rachel's story, continued</span>
<p>
Five days after the Christmas break we returned to the Commune. Just two of the girls from my hut were missing: Caitlyn and Sarah. I suspected that the latter's health had worsened. Caitlyn, on the other hand, seemed to have problems with Daniel being our hut Master. It didn't surprise me since they had been in a relationship before they joined the Empyreal Society. They were replaced by Katrina and Selena, reassigned from the other huts.<br>
<br>
We were promised that our second term would be more play and less work, and I wasn't sure if that was a good or a bad thing. In any case, we got our first taste of the new regime as we exited the bus on the small hill where we had first been introduced to our summer of slavery, five weeks before. This time, everyone, not just the trainees, travelled together. However, the full return took all day because the bus had to make three trips. The last ended just before sunset.<br>
<br>
The residents of Huts D and F were the first to arrive. The ritual was basically the same as before. We girls stripped before disembarking, were then bound, gagged and blindfolded. We were also hobbled with ankle chains. But instead of being tethered in a column, we were lined up shoulder-to-shoulder. Our Masters moved along the line putting us into pairs. I was partnered with Stephanie. My right elbow, ankle and boob were bound to her left ones. Being tethered breast-to-breast was especially degrading, but it wasn't very tight. If either of us were to fall, it would come away without causing injury. But then came the crotch rope. It actually consisted of three strands, the outside ones nestled snugly on either side of the fleshy folds while the fiendishly braided middle one burrowed into my crease. Even before I began moving, the stimulating effect on my clitoris had me gasping.<br>
<br>
I had a good inkling of what was coming next.<br>
<br>
"The race is on," yelled one of the males. "First to the compound wins the prize."<br>
<br>
I dared not contemplate what the prize might be. For as much as we were motivated to please our Masters, winning always meant comeuppance.<br>
<br>
"Go!"<br>
<br>
We started down the hillside and onto the meadow. Sightless, hobbled and trussed together, unable to speak except through grunts and gurgles to coordinate our motions, Steph and I shuffled and stumbled through knee-high grass. The stubble under our bare feet made the going tougher. We could only take short steps, and still each caused the crotch rope to work its way in and out of me, methodically fulfilling its diabolical purpose, abetted by the outside ropes which squeezed my labia inwards for enhanced stimulation. The best way to minimise its effect was to keep my knees apart, but they could only spread so far within our restraints, and anyway that just make walking all the more difficult. I tried to stifle my moans by clenching my jaws hard on the silicone rubber ball filling my mouth. I could hear the other girls above the lowing of cows ruminating languidly in the meadow and the raucous calls of crows taunting us from the trees. I didn't want to give the males the enjoyment of our humiliation; but before long I gave up and joined in the chorus.<br>
<br>
As we reached level ground, my breast tether slackened. Steph's must have come off. I felt a Master's cane prodding my backside. We stopped just long enough for the rope to be reattached. We had by now fallen into a discordant rhythm. It was impossible to keep together for more than a few dozen paces, so we had to keep reducing our tempo to realign our bodies, but not so much as to earn a whack. The ground was more uneven. As well as the grass stubble, sticks and sharp stones gouged our feet, and spiky blades scratched our legs. On occasion the ankle rope snagged on a protruding root or branch. Fortunately we were moving too slowly, our steps too small, to be in danger of tripping. If either of us had fallen, she would take down the other, and with our arms bound behind our backs we had no way of protecting ourselves. Indeed, further along the line I heard every so often one of the other couples take a tumble.<br>
<br>
In urging us to pick up the pace, the Masters were generally positive, using words of encouragement instead of haranguing us; and they applied their canes for just the occasional poke and stroke. There were no fences or similar obstacles to surmount or avoid, which was a blessing, but several times we had to be steered around a tree or a shrub. But it was harder going than that first time, five weeks before. My gag was giving me a raging thirst. It made me salivate heavily, which temporarily moistened my mouth and throat but soon became dehydrating. Meanwhile the crotch rope was starting to drive me crazy. It not only gave me an orgasm; I desperately needed to pee, and eventually I lost control. As the stream ran down the insides of my thighs, I was mortified. (Yet proud that I could endure the indignity as well as the physical torment.)<br>
<br>
The land began to rise once more. Steph and I were getting tired but also more confident. And when the ground levelled and the grass gave way to bare dirt, I knew we were back in the compound. Released from our bonds (except for the blindfolds), we collapsed to our knees lathered in perspiration and groaning from the effect of our crotch ropes. After giving us just a minute to catch our breath, one of the Masters ordered us to line up again.<br>
<br>
There had been no race. I wasn't shocked.<br>
<br>
"Spreads legs and pussies!"<br>
<br>
Hoping I was doing the right thing, I used my fingers to part my labia. I heard the swish of a cane somewhere down the row and the Master barked "Do it properly! Wider!"<br>
<br>
I guessed that I had to present my inner lips and vagina for viewing. It was one of my "What the hell am I doing here?" moments. We stood like this for ages, and it was incredibly demeaning, to be exposing my most intimate parts in front of the males. Then I felt slender, feminine fingers probing the flesh. The woman moved on to Stephanie and said "Some chafing." It was Olivia's voice.<br>
<br>
We were told to remove our blindfolds and give them to one of the Masters. Daniel took mine and lingered in front of me. I think he was hoping I would raise my head so our eyes could connect; but I kept my gaze lowered. The only males present were the five apprentice Masters (no longer complete novices) and two or three others. Nine of us were directed to follow Olivia and Master Andrew to the infirmary while the rest of the girls went to their huts. Olivia and I treated the eight other girls for minor injuries, just scrapes and scratches, incurred during our trek or (as in Stephanie's case) for abrasion from the crotch rope.<br>
<br>
It was still mid-morning. Soon after we discharged the last of our patients I heard, outside, the slaves being mustered for their first assignment. No time was being lost.<br>
<br>
Olivia spent the next hour filling out treatment reports. While she was busy, Master Andrew wandered off; but before he left he made me stand to attention facing a wall, not moving or speaking until he returned. This was a new Andrew, or at least a more forceful, less indulgent version. It surprised me that I liked it. While he was gone, Olivia ignored me; and when she finished her task she joined me facing the wall.<br>
<br>
When Master Andrew came back in, almost apologetically he instructed Olivia to go into the treatment room and lie on the bed. The door remained open and I listened to him ravishing her. I wondered if it bothered him that she never made a sound.<br>
<br>
Afterwards we went back to work. Like nothing had happened, the three of us undertook a thorough inventory of the infirmary which kept us busy for hours. The only reminder of the interlude was the sight of Olivia's labia rings sitting on the cabinet next to the bed.<br>
<br>
Just before lunchtime, Hannah came in with a gash above her left breast. It wasn't deep and the bleeding had stopped, but it was jagged and there was some dirt. Olivia cleaned, sutured and bandaged the wound and wanted her to stay; but the girl insisted on leaving. Olivia whispered something to Master Andrew. He told Master Raymond, who'd escorted Hannah, that she shouldn't be put back to work that day.<br>
<br>
Andrew went for lunch, and one of the girls brought Olivia and me sandwiches. When he returned the Master, without a word, beckoned me to go with him into the treatment room. He bound my hands behind my back. I glanced up and saw his face. He looked tense and his eyes seemed focused on the doorway. Master Robert was standing there, watching us. If either of them caught me peeking they didn't let on.<br>
<br>
When Andrew blindfolded me and told me to kneel, I had a good idea what was now expected of me. From his manner I was sure that he'd never received a blowjob. I don't think he knew that I'd never given one.<br>
<br>
While I don't judge others' likes and preferences, for me the rightful place for a penis is inside my vagina. But funnily enough I welcomed this moment, having the decision taken out of my hands. If I liked it, I'd found a new sensation and once more broadened my horizons. I was travelling down an open road, and every stop brought something new. And if it turned out badly... well, that was the price of the ticket.<br>
<br>
Other thoughts rolled about inside my head like clothes in a tumble dryer. "How do I do this? Should I lick? Do I suck? Must I swallow? What if I gag or puke... or bite?"<br>
<br>
I felt the tip of Master Andrew's penis brushing over my lips. It was big; and I felt shame for my assumption that it might be otherwise. It was moist, and something dripped onto my chest. I thought that maybe he'd already ejaculated, but then said to myself "So this is what precum tastes like." But salty, bitter, oily, I couldn't tell, so perhaps the flavour was my imagination. I put out my tongue to caress him. I salivated to lubricate my mouth just as he pushed himself into it. He then began stroking my head and I thought he was being affectionate; but he grasped a handful of my hair (lightly, since his manhood was between my teeth) and began to slowly move my head back and forth. So he stood bolt upright (as far as I could tell) while I moved my body to and fro. When I was as far forward as I could go, my breasts came up against his legs. He hadn't lowered his trousers even as far as his knees.<br>
<br>
All the way in, his penis penetrated the back of my throat, and I held it there until I was about to choke. Then I pulled back with a gasp, and saliva seeped down my chin and boobs and belly. I tried to keep the shaft inside my mouth, and just once I had to free myself for a few seconds of coughing and spluttering. This did not feel at all romantic or even sexy, yet it was powerfully erotic in a way that I hadn't experienced before. I tingled all over and tickled below my belly.<br>
<br>
So far I had done the work. Now he took control and inclined forward, pushing hard. My face was pressed into his groin until I couldn't breathe. My nose was blocked and my mouth was stuffed. When I felt his sperm spurting, I had no choice but to swallow as it oozed into my throat. For a brief moment I fought back nausea. But it went down without difficulty. After he withdrew, I cleaned his penis with my lips and tongue. It was weird, like I was licking melted ice-cream off a cone. His cum wasn't slimy, it was sticky, but with no discernible taste or smell. What felt yucky were the pubic hairs stuck to my tongue and teeth. I tried to blow them off but didn't want to spit. His dick went soft. I kissed it and leaned back.<br>
<br>
"That wasn't so bad," I said to myself. "Not gross at all." Then I remembered Master Robert standing in the doorway. However, when Master Andrew removed my blindfold, told me to stand up and untied my hands, I found that we were alone, but for Olivia, who had been watching us the whole time. She flashed me a "First time, sweetie?" smile. She was very perceptive, or I was very obvious.<br>
<br>
Now I've been told that I'm a "cold fish" after sex. I don't like to talk and have no need for afterplay or a cuddle. So there was something very satisfying about the way Andrew and I ended what was so new for both of us. It was nice to be left alone with my thoughts, not having to share my feelings. (I guess that was part of the appeal of being a slavegirl. Raw sensation but controlled passion, without the effusion.)<br>
<br>
By nightfall everyone who was returning had arrived in the Commune. Olivia and I stayed in the infirmary until well after dark, and Justine brought us our dinner. Much later, Master Andrew dismissed us to go to our huts.<br>
<br>
In mine, all the other girls were there, awaiting Master Daniel's entrance. Instead of our customary pose, they were down on the floor, braced on their toes, knees, elbows and hands. I copied them, kowtowing at the foot of my bed with my arms stretched out in front. I rested my forehead on the floor but saw that Katrina to my left and Francine to the right had each tilted her head upwards so that her nose and lips touched the boards. As soon as I tried it, I realized that I couldn't rest any of my weight on my head and so my neck was stressed, if only a little. With my knees apart and backside raised up, presented for whipping or penetration, this was a posture of not just discomfort and discipline but submission and abasement. It felt good. Twenty-eight days in the Commune had taught me that humiliation can be a powerful aphrodisiac.<br>
<br>
It was a while before Master Daniel came in.<br>
<br>
Daniel's story, continued<br>
<br>
When I returned to the hut a couple of hours after dinner, I found all fifteen of my slavegirls waiting at the ends of their bunks. They had a new pose, instead of standing to attention facing the wall. They were on their knees and bent forward until they could kiss the floorboards. Their knees were spread wide apart and their arms were stretched out in front of them. It was a position not just of submission but of worship. None moved, didn't twitch nor utter a sound. They had likely been this way since they'd departed the mess hall at least an hour before me. Four weeks of self-discipline had instilled an extraordinary degree of control over their bodies and minds. Yet I could not help but be baffled at what end all this strength of will was being channelled towards. I could only wonder what they were thinking. Each one of us, master and slave, had our own reason for being here; but the girls' experience was so incomprehensibly different from mine. My privileges as a male, otherwise unearned, derived solely from their service and obedience... and suffering.<br>
<br>
I studied them, still wracked with indecision. The all-over tans from twenty-eight days of hard labour under the sun had not faded during the Christmas recess. Muscles were still taut. Four of the bodies were marked by ugly purple stripes. Stephanie and Abigail, Kat and her sister Layla were the most spirited of the girls. I hated that it had become my duty to administer their punishment. But they had not flinched, and I knew it would not be their last flogging. That was another thing I couldn't understand, why they embraced adversity. Of course, it was their recalcitrance that was to blame for my dilemma, my conflict of duty and conscience. This made me resent them and so whip them harder, which made them more defiant and more wanton. It was a vicious circle, and somehow their psyches fed on it.<br>
<br>
I went up to Laura and asked her to get to her feet. I hooked two fingers under her collar. She didn't raise her head. I wanted to tell her "Look me in the eyes," but was apprehensive of what she'd see. I had already betrayed my nerves. My hand trembled at her throat. But I wasn't worried about how I was about to perform. It didn't matter. I knew that, however much our relationship had changed since I'd joined the Empyreal Society, this was a turning point. Whatever happened now, whichever way we went, there was no going back to where we had once been.<br>
<br>
I led her to my room. Without instruction she crawled onto the bed and lay on her back. She spread her legs and placed her hands beside her head on the pillow. Irrationally, I didn't like her taking the initiative. At the same time I was grateful. This was the confusion of thoughts swimming through my brain. I studied her, running my gaze from her pretty hazel eyes that stared unblinking towards the ceiling, across her flushed cheeks, down her breasts heaving to her quickening breath, over her belly quivering with anticipation. The pink folds between her thighs glistened with her vaginal juices and also the tiny silver rings that pierced and joined her labia. I grazed my fingers across her lips, pressing them into her mouth. She licked and sucked them. As I moved them to her crotch she closed her eyes and began to pant and gasp. She was preparing her body for me, and for the first time I realized what total control I had over my beloved Laura. Nothing I'd done with or to her up until now had evoked a response like this.<br>
<br>
I could have leapt and whooped and shouted out my joy. I contained myself, steadied my hands and unfastened the rings that barred her entrance. They pierced her inner labia, so my fingers brushed her clitoris and went inside her. The tissue was soft and warm and moist, and slightly red and tender-looking as if the healing hadn't quite finished. She remained perfectly still as I groped about; but I could feel the growing tension in the skin and muscles of her pelvis. The rings were held in place with a tiny ball and socket. I slid them out of their holes and placed them on the bedside stand.<br>
<br>
I hesitated, feeling a little queasy, even dizzy. Laura's eyes hadn't opened, but she was smiling. I desperately hoped she wouldn't say anything. Words of encouragement at that moment would have been demoralizing. But what made me pause was not a sudden fear of failure. What was coming I wanted more than ever, had fantasized about for years, had rehearsed in my mind countless times. But that was the point. Laura had always been inaccessible, unobtainable. Yet now she lay before me, naked and compliant. That was the problem. Would we have been here, doing this, if she were not a slavegirl and I not her master?<br>
<br>
I shook these notions out of my head. If she didn't want to be here, she wouldn't be. So perhaps I was just her instrument for pleasure and fulfillment. Well, that was it had always been between us. Laura, as usual, was getting what she wanted, and I was still her minion.<br>
<br>
"Okay, then," I said, not meaning for the words to be spoken aloud.<br>
<br>
She nodded and smiled again. But she braced her body instead of relaxing. I had no idea what that meant.<br>
<br>
I took off my trousers and lay on top of her. The first touch of our naked loins was like an electric charge -- not a physical shock but a mental tremor. My penis was nestled in her crease but not inside her. I could feel her clit against the head of my shaft. I tried to keep still because I was afraid I would cum before entering her. I regretted, in a way, that I wasn't wearing a condom. I wanted nothing between us, and wanted to leave part of me inside her; but if I had lost my load before time, at least with a rubber it wouldn't be onto her belly. I couldn't have dealt with that embarrassment... Damn! Laura had always messed with my mind... but I was doing a good enough job of that now on my own.<br>
<br>
I lifted myself up and then went down again, sliding into her. I didn't try to get creative. I started off slow, so she could relax again, and fully open up, in both senses. I raised myself on my arms for maximum leverage, then rested my weight on her for whole body contact. As my chest pressed against hers, I wished I had taken off my shirt; but she slid her hands under it to stroke my back. Her fingernails dug into my skin. I changed angles, rocked and swivelled my hips, just a little, to fill her fully, pushing deeper and harder. She began to moan and thrust. She opened her legs as far as she could to give me room to manoeuvre; but she clenched the walls of her vagina as if to hold me in there, making me a part of her. She was not going to remain passive. That was never Laura's style, even though, as a slavegirl, she might have.<br>
<br>
We did not kiss. Oddly, I felt that would be too intimate. As much as I might pretend, we were not in love. I gazed down at her beautiful face, flushed and dappled with perspiration. She opened her eyes just once, staring into mine for a few seconds. I would have given up everything else just for that. She had never looked so sweet, so fragile, so vulnerable, so exquisitely gorgeous. I felt closer to her than ever before, and more, I knew, than I ever would again.<br>
<br>
As I felt the rush of my semen into her, I started to lose momentum, but her climax was just beginning. She wrapped and squeezed her legs around mine, to clutch me so I could not withdraw. And once depleted, I lay still in her grasp, on top of her, inside her, for ages. We didn't speak. I turned my head to one side and rested my cheek on her forehead. It was hot and damp. I could feel her heart pumping, through her breasts. But her nipples had subsided.<br>
<br>
Laura had not used lubricant. I don't know if that made it harder for her. But her responses were real, the pleasure she felt was not a put-on. She wasn't the type to fake an orgasm. And I would have been insulted if she'd tried. So I was glad, and not just out of masculine pride. I was happy that I could give her at least a moment of true ecstasy.<br>
<br>
The Temple of Laura had been breached, but not desecrated.<br>
<br>
I could have insisted that she stay in my bed until morning. I didn't; but neither did I want the night to end. I asked her to kneel and I tied a blindfold around her head. I left her there as I went out to shower and change into fresh clothes. The rest of the girls were sleeping in the darkened hut -- or, more likely, lying awake listening to us in silence. I returned for Laura and guided her across the compound to the mess hall. It was just before midnight. There were a dozen or so guys at the tables playing cards, served by two slaves. I sat near the doorway and Laura knelt at my feet. Juliette brought us two mugs of steaming cocoa. She looked tired. She beamed when I said "Thank you."<br>
<br>
I placed the mug in Laura's hands. She sniffed the aroma and let the steam waft over her blindfold. She took a sip and sighed.<br>
<br>
My fellow masters paid scant attention to us. Those who did took one look at my little slavegirl and her body still glistening with sweat. It was a cool night so her skin hadn't dried. They all then offered me nods of approval. Some of them would, sooner or later, also taste the sublime delights that Laura had to offer; but for now she belonged entirely to me.<br>
<br>
In the morning, she knocked on my door and politely asked if she might retrieve her "pussy rings". I didn't volunteer to re-attach them, and she didn't suggest it. And she never looked me in the eyes again, as long as we were in the Commune. The brief connection we shared, when I lay with her, would not be repeated. I knew that, and accepted it. She continued to serve and obey me, as she did for all her masters. And I had sex with all of the slavegirls in my hut, as was my right and my duty. Yet I felt that, with Laura, I was back in the place where I'd been during all those years when she was untouchable.<br>
<br>
Still, with those experiences now behind me, I can look back at that night for my sense of closure. We are both married now... to other people. We reunite occasionally, for coffee and reminiscences, but we have not met each other's families, and likely never will. I don't know if her husband knows anything about her adventures as a slavegirl.<br>
<br>
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Our time in the Summer Commune was far from over, some parts of the journey just beginning.
