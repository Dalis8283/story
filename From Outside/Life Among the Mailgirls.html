<p> The early morning sounds of the city continued on behind Sarah Jane Scott as she crossed the marbled lobby of US Financial Plaza, but they were quickly fading into the background. Sunrise was still a good half hour away, and the Financial District was lit in the waxing blue light that signaled a new day, new opportunities, new promises.
<br><br>
Elsewhere in the city, people were only just now waking, only just now getting showered and shaved, only just now picking out their clothes for work. They were saying good morning to their spouses or boyfriends or girlfriends with a morning kiss. They were checking their smartphones for new emails, social media for new pictures and updates from friends, the headlines for what was going on in the world that morning.
<br><br>
But for Sarah, "elsewhere" was just that -- elsewhere. The rest of the city was already a world away, and fading fast. Her world, her universe, was here: a forty-eight story skyscraper in Southern Manhattan that served as national headquarters for US Financial. The rhythms of other people's lives -- the normalcy, the decency -- were irrelevant to Sarah's life at US Financial Plaza.
<br><br>
Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she sped towards the security desk, David and Pedro greeting her with big smiles. She was immaculately dressed -- three inch black leather heels, a black pencil skirt so tight it constricted her every step, and a button-down white blouse with just a few too many buttons left un-buttoned at the top. Her cleavage bounced with each step, her natural, C-cup breasts playing peek-a-boo above the neckline, and the hint of her black lace bra popping just in and out of view.
<br><br>
She wouldn't have dressed this way when she started with USF three months ago, done up and put together like a sexual predator, as if hunting for a meal on Wall Street. High heels, tits on display, and ass swaying seductively behind her. But, then, a lot had changed over the last three months, and Sarah often found herself wondering what that Sarah Scott would have thought of this one. Or what this Sarah Scott would have told that one about what lay ahead. Or if that Sarah Scott were the real one, or this Sarah Scott was.
<br><br>
She was attractive. She knew that much. Long blonde hair framed a face that might have been chosen at random from a women's fashion magazine, complete with bright blue eyes, high cheekbones, and perfect teeth. And those lips -- thin, but sexy as hell -- when smiling, hinted that Sarah was in on a secret the rest of the world was not. She looked less a girl-next-door than a smart, cynical trouble-maker, sitting at the back of class and scheming about which boy to lure under the bleachers after detention. Which, for anyone who knew Sarah, was laughable, and completely at-odds with the girl in real life. She'd been a band-geek in high school, clueless about a world beyond her clarinet, who'd spent the better part of two years dating a closeted (but,in retrospect, obviously gay) cellist, and who'd carried her virginity embarrassingly late into college. She'd been summa cum laude at Pepperdine, and spent her time in Malibu significantly more in the library than on the beach. And, now twenty-six years old and four years deep into a PhD at Yale, she could still count the men she'd been with on one hand.
<br><br>
Reflecting on that Sarah Scott -- the straight A's high school clarinetist, the dual anthropology and sociology major, the anthropology-slash-women's studies doctoral candidate -- Sarah felt she'd been play-acting then almost as much as she was now. The provocatively dressed Wall Street siren, with the self-confidence and the come-hither smile, was every bit as much a fictional character, and didn't capture the actual girl beneath the clothes.
<br><br>
Sarah flashed her USF badge at the two security guards as she passed, but she needn't have bothered; they knew exactly who she was. The ear-to-ear grins told her as much. And even if they hadn't recognized her by sight, the full-body shot in the picture ID would have given it away, as there were only a handful of employees in the company whose pictures included more than a head-shot for identification.
<br><br>
Past the security desk was a set of escalators up to the second floor, and the main elevator banks beyond that. As she ascended, Sarah glanced over her shoulder. The first floor lobby was still mostly empty at six in the morning, as few USF employees outside of Sarah's department bothered to arrive this early. There were a number of the other girls -- Sarah's teammates, her colleagues for another thirteen-fourteen hours -- who arrived just prior to the start of their shift at seven, none too eager to spend more time at work here in the Plaza than they absolutely had to. But Sarah preferred a less rushed and harried start to her day, as there were consequences to being late. She would rather be prepped and ready for her day, waiting on the tick, tick, tick of the clock, than be stressing over traffic or worrying whether she'd taken care of everything she needed to prior to her shift beginning.
<br><br>
While the lobby, and the entire first floor, was open to the public, the second was restricted to USF employees, clients, and other guests. Downstairs, there were a handful of stores -- a bakery and coffee shop, a bookstore, a small sandwich shop, and even a boutique lingerie store among them -- as well as another set of elevators down to the basement levels and parking garage. Upstairs, the second floor was more wide open, save for four massive columns that housed the building's primary elevator shafts and access to the upper floors, and a picture-glass wall into what had at one time been home to a fitness center for USF employees. There was a coffee cart, already open, as well a shoe-shine service, a newsstand, and an ever-increasing number of café tables and chairs spread about.
<br><br>
Sarah smiled uncomfortably at the gentleman manning the coffee cart as she stepped from the top of the escalator. Even at this early hour, and in contrast to the mostly empty lobby below, there were already a good seventeen, eighteen people scattered about. They sipped their coffees and pretended to flip through newspapers, but all of them looked up to see who was passing by. Most were men, alone. But a few of them sat in pairs, and there were always more women present than Sarah would have expected; Jessica Cochran, from Finance & Accounting, smiled at her as she passed. Sarah steeled herself as walked past them all. It was her last day with US Financial, and this was the last time she'd flash her badge at the security guards, the last time she'd ride the escalator up to the main elevator lobby, the last time she'd have to parade past the early morning coffee club. Tomorrow, she'd be moving back to New Haven, the summer over and her time with USF come to an end. She wouldn't miss her job here, and wouldn't miss anyone beyond the girls she worked most closely with. At least, not exactly.
<br><br>
Sarah bit her lip, and hesitated.
<br><br>
She'd learned so much that summer, even beyond the research directly applicable to her doctoral thesis. She'd learned about a sadistic little kernel that existed seemingly in everyone, even if it was buried deep and often denied. She'd learned about a masochistic side that apparently could be found in a shockingly large subset of the female population. If not the entire female population. If not the entire population as a whole, gender aside. Sarah wasn't entirely sure how extensive this tendency truly was -- it was a part of her research that demanded further study, and a theory that even she and her faculty advisor disagreed on. But, regardless, she'd discovered it in herself, and Sarah Scott had learned more about Sarah Scott in the last three months than she had in all her years of formal education.
<br><br>
Sarah strode from the escalator, pocketbook over one shoulder and dressed to fit in with other young, successful women working in New York's financial market. She made her way between the two central columns - two sets of elevator doors on either side - that carried USF employees up into the building. But Sarah wasn't heading up, at least not yet, and she passed by elevators to the double-door entrance to the former fitness center.
<br><br>
Clearly visible on either side of the doors, displayed prominently to anyone waiting for the elevator, or seated at one of the table for a cup of a coffee, or reading the Wall Street Journal at the newsstand, were a pair of leather benches. To this day, they still reminded Sarah of pommel horses, wide enough to fit two people across. Correction: two girls across.
<br><br>
No, the Sarah Scott who'd entered US Financial Plaza at the start of June wouldn't recognize this Sarah Scott. And this Sarah Scott would have a difficult time understanding that one. But then, the navel-gazing and introspection was moot the moment that the girl crossed the threshold beyond the double doors, because at that moment Sarah Scott disappeared.
<br><br>
For one last time, Sarah Jane Scott was stripped even of her name. The blonde who entered the open locker room on the other side was Mailgirl Number Thirteen.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Thirteen entered the locker room to the sound of a running shower to her right, to whispered and subdued conversation, and the sound of another girl's moans of pleasures echoing across the tiles. The large, metal desk in front of her, with its back to the double-doors and the elevator lobby beyond, sat unoccupied. It was both utilitarian and terrifying, an unadorned piece of throwback office furniture that had been transformed into an intimidating symbol of control by its owner; even now, despite the fact that Thirteen knew that Mistress Zero was still at least thirty minutes away, bare minimum.
<br><br>
The mailgirls' locker room stretched in both directions, from left to right on either side of the desk, on either side of where Thirteen entered the room. It was entirely balanced and symmetrical; in addition the spanking benches flanking the double doors, each side had four sinks, four showers, and twelve open, door-less lockers that faced into the center of the room. On the other side of metal desk was a corridor that led to another lobby, where the girls could access the building's East, West, and North Staircases, as well as the four service elevators. There was no door to enter the service lobby, as there was to elevator lobby behind her. But that fact hadn't alarmed Thirteen on her first day as much as the six prison-issue toilets, three on either wall along the corridor, open and exposed for anyone to see. Thirteen, though, had read of mailgirls forced to pee in litter boxes and mop sinks in other companies, so she ultimately decided to accept the toilets as some bare minimum concession that the mailgirls were still, on some level, human beings.
<br><br>
Not that this was something Mistress Zero, or the men in Human Capital, encouraged the girls to think. On either side of the metal desk, on the floor, were two pairs of silver dog bowls. They'd been filled the night before by the girls on duty for Evening Shift, and left overnight for any girl thirsty for a drink the next morning. As the day progressed, it fell to Mistress Zero to refill -- or, more accurately, to instruct one of her girls to refill -- the bowls.
<br><br>
Being Number Thirteen, the blonde had the misfortune of having the first locker on the right, closest to her mistress's desk. It was here she went first, to put her purse down, take off her heels, and run her thumbprint over the smartphone charging there within. And, without thinking any more of it, without lamenting her misfortune or the humiliation of the exercise, Thirteen turned back to Mistress Zero's desk, dropped to her hands and knees, brushed her hair back from her face, and began sipping up water from the bowl. Her ass in the air, her face in the dog bowl, Thirteen drank down the room-temperature water, not even bothering anymore to consider the fact that the bowl was already half-empty, and had likely already been drunk from by at least one or two other girls. She was thirsty, but she was careful not to drink too much; not only was it common for Mistress Zero to "forget" to refill the bowls, but Thirteen knew she'd be able to have a drink in a few minutes in the shower. And, besides, she had found that one of the biggest challenges to being a mailgirl was not the humiliation of delivering interoffice envelopes in the nude, nor enduring the punishment for racking up too many demerits, nor the physical exertion of climbing up and down stairs or spending long stretches of time on her knees. No, three months in, Thirteen still found it difficult to balance the necessities of hydration with the realities of a limited number of bathroom breaks.
<br><br>
Still fully dressed, aside from her shoes, Thirteen stood and nodded down the line of lockers to Numbers Fifteen and Sixteen, already stark naked. Fifteen was a tall, slender brunette, with relatively small breasts but puffy nipples, and a mischievous side that couldn't help but rebel against her new station in life. Sixteen was an African-American girl with an ever-so-slight Southern accent, light brown skin, and a shock of dark, curly, chin-length hair that seemed to be a source of pride for someone whose daily work attire consisted of little more than an armband and a smartphone. The new Number Twenty-Three, another brunette, was there as well; three weeks in, Thirteen still thought of her as the "new" Number Twenty-Three, having replaced the previous Number Twenty-Three, who herself had only been a mailgirl for five weeks in total. Twenty-One, too, was here, and was already in the shower, alone. On the other side of the room were One, Five, Nine, and Twelve. As well as Two and Three, in the far set of showers - which explained where the moans were coming from.
<br><br>
No sign of Number Seven.
<br><br>
"Today's your last day?" Twelve asked from her locker, standing in just a bra and a pair of hip-hugger panties. She was pixie-cut blonde, approximately Thirteen's height and build, and closer in age Thirteen than most of the other girls (though, admittedly, the oldest girl in the program was just eight years older than Thirteen herself). The pixie cut had actually grown in; it had initially been much shorter, and bequeathed upon Twelve as a punishment by Mistress Zero. It was a friendly enough question, but it was tinged with suspicion, accusation, and jealousy. The girls all knew it, of course -- they knew Thirteen was getting out, was getting free of the program. But Thirteen wasn't sure if she should being calling attention to that fact or not. Was she a symbol of hope? Or was her release after three months just one more form of torture for the girls that still had nineteen, twenty, twenty-one more months to go?
<br><br>
"It is," Thirteen replied politely. "Wish me luck."
<br><br>
"Good luck," Twelve answered glumly.
<br><br>
Torture, Thirteen decided.
<br><br>
And then, from Twelve, "They'll fuck you."
<br><br>
Thirteen glanced back over at the other girl, as if she hadn't heard her. Or as if she hadn't understood her.
<br><br>
"They'll fuck you," Twelve repeated. "You know they will." It wasn't Twelve being a bitch. It wasn't her striking out at Thirteen for getting free. What she was offering was sincere concern, a friendly warning for Thirteen not to get her hopes too high. There was no doubt that Twelve was rooting for Thirteen to escape, but there was also no doubt that Twelve felt it wouldn't actually happen.
<br><br>
"I'm sure," Thirteen managed to reply politely, even if she didn't believe the sentiment. Sure, she suffered alongside these other girls, and she did the same job as these other girls. She was stripped and embarrassed the same as these other girls, and she was spanked, paddled, and punished the same as these other girls. But she was different from them; apart. She knew that, and understood that, even if the other girls couldn't see it. This was a three-month sentence for Thirteen, while it was two years for everyone else.
<br><br>
"No, I promise," Twelve went on, and offered again, "they'll fuck you." She reached behind her back, and unfastened her bra. "You'll be here tomorrow. Some sort of threat. Some sort of bullshit penalty. Some sort of legal maneuvering we're too fucking dumb to see coming."
<br><br>
Thirteen let it slide, and unfastened the waist of her skirt. Whatever Twelve thought, whatever Twelve said, Thirteen knew she was different. This was just part of life among the mailgirls -- the constant fear of some new torment, either physical and psychological, just waiting to be sprung upon them.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
On the face of it, the entire mailgirl phenomenon was preposterous.
<br><br>
The first Thirteen had heard of it, four or five years earlier, she hadn't entirely believed that it could be real. After all, how could this really, truly, be a thing? It had popped up in an "infotainment" type news story online, that covered one of the first two or three programs in Tokyo in a laughing "isn't this weird?!" sort of way. Maybe it was just a cultural thing that Americans couldn't understand -- a bunch of young girls scurrying around an office building, delivering packages in the nude? Thirteen remembered the general tone of that first story: "Ha ha ha! Aren't the Japanese crazy?"
<br><br>
But it turned out it wasn't a culture issue -- at least not in the traditional East vs. West sort of way. The first few mailgirl programs in Tokyo turned out to have an odd sort of staying power, and tapped into the imaginations and secret (or, not so secret) desires of men in positions of power throughout the region. Osaka. Sapporo. And then, Hong Kong. Singapore and Seoul. And then onto Berlin. Mailgirls went from a masturbatory fantasy of teenaged boys to a viral reality overnight.
<br><br>
It was a simple enough idea that got picked up and repeated again and again. Relatively young, attractive girls volunteered to take over mailroom duties at their places of work, always in the nude, and usually in exchange for some large sum of money or promise of eventual career advancement. It didn't surprise Thirteen that there were perverse older men, high up in some of these companies, who would support the idea. She supposed it didn't entirely surprise her that there were women out there -- exhibitionists, submissives, girls desperate for cash -- that would agree to work naked in exchange for some sort large lump sum. Even if Thirteen, when news of the programs first broke, could never in a million years have imagined that she'd end up as one of them, she supposed she didn't fault these mailgirls-of-her-imagination for signing on. And maybe, maybe, it made sense in a porn-obsessed place like Japan, or in Germany with its FKK culture. After all, this was occurring in privately owned office buildings, during work hours in which children weren't around.
<br><br>
But then the Times ran a piece on the "mailgirls phenomenon" in its International section. Cosmo ran a feature-length piece on what being a mailgirl was like in Tokyo. 20/20 covered it, as did all of the cable news networks, and all the major networks soon after. Mailgirls were featured as part of one of HBO's "Late Night" documentaries. And photos and videos soon began showing up online.
v
What Thirteen found was that mailgirl programs were darker and more sadistic than she'd ever imagined. Sexual abuse was rampant, though perhaps she'd been naïve to ever imagine a world where it wouldn't have been. More disturbing was just how terrible these girls were treated without sex even directly entering the equation -- instead of the whole thing being soft-core and sexy, it had strong BDSM elements that were demeaning, at best.
<br><br>
And yet...
<br><br>
And yet...
<br><br>
And yet Thirteen hadn't been able to look away. She hadn't been able pass by some new account of a girl's life as a mailgirl. She hadn't been able to keep from clicking through to see some sort of NSFW video. Or to stop from downloading a picture of some girl being whipped for delivering a package a few minutes too late. And she knew she wasn't alone -- the mailgirls "thing" seemed strike a nerve for a lot of people worldwide. It scratched an itch than a lot of people hadn't even known they had.
<br><br>
For Thirteen, this curiosity hadn't been sexual at the time. Or, at least, she didn't think it had been; who knew anymore? She'd minored in Women's Studies as an undergraduate, and she'd come to the East Coast specifically to study under Dr. Gillian Schang in New Haven, whose work in Anthropology included a particular focus on Third- and Fourth-Wave Feminism. Thirteen's own forthcoming doctorate was technically in Socio-Cultural Anthropology, but it was heavily flavored by Women's Studies. Her research to that point had been women's place in society, but also women's "culture," in and of itself. She'd been interested how women interacted with one another -- almost with a social psychology bent. And so, Thirteen had approached what it meant to be a mailgirl from a purely academic standpoint.
<br><br>
Gillian had pushed it upon her even more, encouraging her to double-down on "mailgirl culture" as an area of focus for her doctoral thesis. And Thirteen had complied. After all, the entire thing seemed tailor-made for her particular sliver of academic interest. It was also Gillian who suggested field work: although there had been a handful of peer-reviewed journal articles about mailgirls from an industrial psychology or economic standpoint, no one had yet looked at it from a cultural or anthropological direction. And then, too, Thirteen had agreed and complied, fully intending to fly to Seattle, or San Francisco, or Los Angeles, to interview and observe some of the nascent mailgirl programs that had begun to get a foothold on the West Coast.
<br><br>
But Gillian wanted Thirteen to go one step further. There was an opportunity, she pushed, to truly understand what made a mailgirl tick, and how a mailgirl interacted with both her peers and her superiors. Thirteen would be losing something by using anonymous surveys and one-on-one interviews, researching and reporting on everything second-hand. No, Gillian reasoned. The best way for Thirteen to study what it meant to be a mailgirl was the live among the mailgirls, to live as a mailgirl herself.
<br><br>
Thirteen, naturally, had balked.
<br><br>
She had more information than most girls had when opting to become a mailgirl, having studied how the programs had worked in Japan, Central Europe, and in the Pacific Northwest. She'd read firsthand accounts of girls being humiliated and tormented time and again. Not every program was exactly the same; in fact, policies varied widely from company to company, depending on their authors. But the commonalities and central concept should have been enough to terrify any girl away. There was no way Thirteen would ever be caught stripping off her clothes and signing her life away.
<br><br>
As she remembered how adamant she had once been, Thirteen slithered out of her skirt, and let it pool at her feet.
<br><br>
Gillian had continued to push her, and had even gone so far as to secure a privately-funded research grant for the two of them. There wasn't a company out there that was going to sign a sixty-year-old like Gillian on as a mailgirl, but she continued to believe that she and her student were at the forefront of something truly fascinating. She pressed Thirteen forcefully, over the course of three separate meetings, before Thirteen had made an empty promise to give it more thought. And, even as Thirteen designed a framework for her research into a mailgirls program that had sprung up in a dot.com in San Francisco the year prior, Gillian hadn't given up on the idea of a placing a research assistant into a program as a mailgirl; if that wasn't going to be Thirteen, she was going to find another girl. Gillian arranged a meeting between Thirteen and Guy Dubuc, another faculty member at Yale, as Gillian herself interviewed a handful of young, attractive first- and second-year female graduate students. While Gillian hadn't come right out and said it, the implied threat was clear -- she'd move on with another girl, and Thirteen would be looking for a new faculty advisor.
<br><br>
That was the stick. But Gillian wasn't empty-handed when it came to a carrot. The research grant she'd received was sizeable, and she was willing to put the majority of it into Thirteen's hands. Food and housing would be completely covered, and Thirteen would receive a generous stipend for other expenses, to use entirely as she saw fit. Moreover, a doctoral thesis on the mailgirl controversy, along with a joint publication with the reputable Gillian Schang, probably meant a faculty position at a place like Stanford or Berkeley, or one of the Ivies.
<br><br>
In the end, it was the opportunity at USF that got Thirteen to finally commit. In San Francisco, she would have been only just north of her mother and step-father in Santa Clara, whereas USF's New York headquarters meant there would be an entire continent between the shame of what she was doing and her family. Also, USF at that time had only just announced their mailgirls program -- which meant that Gillian and Thirteen could watch a program be built from the ground up. And, perhaps most importantly, Gillian knew the program's director personally. Will Barrow, now USF's Director of Human Capital (a smaller unit within USF's larger Human Resources division), had been an undergraduate at Yale, and had studied under Gillian. Unlike other programs, Thirteen could be assured she'd be protected and looked after -- relatively, of course. With Barrow in charge, Gillian was convinced that there was less of a risk that USF's initiative would descend into the realms of full-on sexual slavery that had swallowed up a handful of other iterations of mailgirls.
<br><br>
Even then, the uneasy agreement Gillian had brokered between USF on one end, and Thirteen on the other, had nearly fallen apart half a dozen times before the summer began. Fearful of extensions and legal trickery, Thirteen had refused to sign away her Power-of-Attorney to the company, as other girls were forced to as part of their standard mailgirl contracts. For USF, this was a sticking point, and they ultimately budged only after Thirteen had agreed to sign her legal rights over to Gillian and Yale's Anthropology Department, instead.
<br><br>
USF, on their end, was wary of what they were getting out of the deal, and concerned that they hadn't laid eyes on this grad student turned potential mailgirl. In addition to sharing Thirteen's research, Gillian assured the company that that needn't worry about Thirteen, but they insisted on seeing her picture nonetheless. When they received headshots and fully clothed pictures, they insisted on seeing her body. When they received a naked selfie that Thirteen had taken in her bathroom mirror (to that point, the most humiliating thing that Thirteen had ever done), they'd insisted that she send them more, including shots from behind, from below, from all over. And, the fact that there had been six days between that next submission and when Thirteen finally received an invitation to come down to New York had been tortuous to the girl's self esteem.
<br><br>
In the locker room, Thirteen hung her skirt in her locker, and began to unbutton her already half-unbuttoned blouse. Her black lace, demi-cup bra was exposed first, and a matching thong came into view as she worked her way south. Because USF now controlled every aspect of her life within the building, they even mandated how she hung and folded her "street clothes" as she got "into uniform." Her blouse was hung carefully alongside the skirt, but everything else was to be folded neatly on the lower shelf -- pants, if she'd been wearing them, top (if not hung), then panties, then bra. Outerwear to innerwear, top to bottom. Mistress Zero claimed that this was so the mailgirls' locker room, exposed to the elevator lobby, would never look cluttered or out-of-sorts. The truth was that it was just another petty form of control.
<br><br>
Thirteen was certainly exposed. She was facing her locker, and had her back turned towards the locker room's entrance, but she guessed there were still almost twenty people on the far side who were able to watch her undress. If she turned, Thirteen would only see her own reflection, wearing nothing more than her bra and panties. But it was mirror-glass, and though Thirteen couldn't see out, she knew full well that her audience was able to see in. The mirror-glass ran the length of the locker room -- from the showers, to the sinks, to the bondage-and-discipline set-up by the front door, and anyone on the other side could watch her shower or put on make-up, watch her lap water from the dog-bowl, watch her pee while on one of the exposed toilets. But the mirror-glass had become a blessing in disguise, as even if she knew there were men and women out there able to watch her every move and see every part of her body, Thirteen could trick herself into almost forgetting that fact. She'd entered through the main elevator lobby that morning, and she'd exit through it that evening; in-between, she could deny that that outside world was even there.
<br><br>
Thirteen reached behind her back and unsnapped her bra. She slid the straps down her exposed arms, revealing round, natural, and firm Goldilocks breasts -- neither too big, nor too small. She had pinkish brown areolae, and nipples that had, as of late, spent more time standing at attention than at rest. That very moment was no different, as the cool air of the locker room, combined with the embarrassment and excitement of undressing more-or-less in public, had them standing upright and outwards.
<br><br>
Would transferring to Guy Dubuc to finish out her PhD have been the end of the world? Would letting some other girl assist Gillian Schang and her research into mailgirl culture have set Thirteen back that much, career-wise? After all, Thirteen had suffered for that honor, more than she had ever expected to. Earlier that summer, Thirteen would have mostly certainly said "no," and been more than happy to let some other girl take her place here at USF. Now that she was mostly looking at her time as a mailgirl in the rearview mirror, she felt differently, and just hoped that her work was as significant as Gillian assured her it was.
<br><br>
Thirteen found the waistline of her panties, and slid them off. She dutifully folded the thong neatly, or as neatly as anyone could expect her to fold such a minimal amount of fabric, and carefully positioned it in her locker with her bra on top. She was shaved bare -- as all the girls were -- from the neck down, and her pussy was visible to anyone who even bothered to glance in her direction. She had no tattoos and no piercings (aside from her ear lobes), and the only markings she bore on her body were from a faded, black, felt-tip marker: Thirteen was clearly demarcated as such, with her assigned number scrawled on her right hip.
<br><br>
She'd showered three times since Mistress Zero had traced the number thirteen on her body the previous morning, but the reality was that the marker was stubborn and difficult to get off without vigorous scrubbing. Back in early June, Thirteen had insisted on getting it off before she went home. She had hated seeing it when she was home, being reminded of what her daily life was now like. But, like so many other things as she spent more and more days as a mailgirl, Thirteen had eventually surrendered -- why bother going through that effort if she was just going to be marked up again the next day? Yesterday, Mistress Zero had only run her marker over the previous day's number thirteen, as she'd done the day before that and the day before that. And as she'd do later this morning.
<br><br>
Thirteen took her earrings out. She took off her rings, bracelets, and watch. She unfastened her platinum pendant. All of these things were placed in a utilitarian metal cup that each girl had in her locker for such items, and Thirteen wondered -- not for the first time -- why she bothered to put jewelry on in the morning, in the first place.
<br><br>
With one notable exception among USF's mailgirls, there seemed to be two schools of thought as to how the girls should dress in the morning. The first held that, since they would be stripping the moment they arrived at work, it didn't matter what they wore. These girls -- and they were increasingly in the minority -- arrived each day in something like yoga pants or lounge wear, comfortable sneakers and lightweight sweatshirts.
<br><br>
The other school, and the one that Thirteen was now firmly encamped in, felt the need to overcompensate for their actual work uniforms by putting themselves together as if they were going to real, normal jobs on Wall Street. It didn't matter if they had to get up even earlier than they already were. It didn't matter if they showered and did their hair at home only to have to repeat the exercise here in the locker room a short while later. Thirteen liked getting dressed in the morning, she liked the normalcy of the routine, she liked being able to pass as any other girl commuting to the office. The style had gravitated more and more towards "vampish" though, and there were any number of unspoken rules among the mailgirls themselves that they all followed, even if Mistress Zero had nothing to do with them. Only skirts and dresses were worn, for instance. There was also a fine line between "flirty" and "slutty," and it was a "no-no" to cross from the former into the latter. Short skirts were acceptable, to a point; tightness, on the other hand, was far more important.
<br><br>
Thirteen, like most girls, had started in the first camp -- sweatpants and jeans, t-shirts and casual shoes -- almost as if the way she dressed was itself the first stage on the twelve steps towards becoming a full-blown mailgirl. Embarassment. Depression. Nihilism. But then, eventually, came acceptance, and a desire to fit in with the mores and habits of the girls before her. And, before she knew it, Thirteen was spending an alarmingly high percentage of her stipend on business-wear that she'd put on only for the commute to work, and then again for the commute home.
<br><br>
And then, outside of those two schools of commuting wardrobe, there was Number One. She hadn't been assigned her number for any specific reason, only that she'd just happened to be approached to volunteer just an hour or so before Number Three and the original Number Two. But something about the number had set her apart, even if it was just in her own mind. She alone commuted to and from work in-uniform -- naked, except for a cropped, tan, summer-weight trench coat.
<br><br>
Given that her locker was more-or-less in the center of the locker room, Thirteen really had her choice as to whether she would shower on one end of the room or the other. Girls tended to gravitate towards the shower block closest to their lockers, but they weren't slavish towards doing so. There were eight showerheads for twenty-four girls, and they all needed to shower around the same times as one another in the morning, over lunch, and in the evening. In practice, then, the girls showered wherever there was an open spot. If there wasn't one, and they weren't willing or able to wait, they typically joined one of the other girls and shared.
<br><br>
Number Twenty-Three had joined Twenty-One in the shower block on Thirteen's end of the locker room, and both Fifteen and Sixteen looked to be following behind momentarily. On the other end, Two and Three were both still finger-deep in their own sex (hence, the moaning Thirteen had been greeted with that morning) under a single shower head. One and Twelve had just begun their respective showers alone. And Five was just getting out. Thirteen chose to cross to the other side of the locker room and take Five's place, counter-intuitively preferring to shower as close to the masturbating pair of girls as possible. The logic went that, when one girl or another was touching herself, no one in the audience on the other side of the mirror glass was going to pay one lick of attention to the other girls nearby.
<br><br>
Twelve had taken the showerhead closest to the two masturbators, however, and only One's presence under the far left showerhead had kept Five from sliding any further away from them when she'd been showering. Like the toilets leading to the service elevators, there were no partitions, no shower curtains, and no privacy; the shower blocks themselves were open to the room beyond. But it wasn't as if the locker room filled with steam each morning; not only would that steam have fogged the view the USF employees had of the showering mailgirls, but it would have meant the mailgirls would have been allowed a simple creature comfort as warm water.
<br><br>
Cold showers were universally acknowledged as a solution for getting too aroused, but you couldn't tell that to the two girls with their fingers inside themselves at one end of the shower block. Such was a fact of life in the locker room, as the girls dealt with the confusing feelings of arousal caused by their current vocation. Full-blown lesbian love-making was a punishable offense, at least here in the building, but Two and Three (a couple since before Thirteen had joined the program) managed to stay on the right side of the line by keeping their hands to themselves. It wasn't exactly uncommon for two girls to be diddling themselves side by side, but the amount of eye contact and the proximity with which Two and Three were doing it was rare. More common sights included girls washing one another's backs or shampooing one another's hair, sharing a brief and friendly peck on the cheeks or even lips as a quick hello, or playfully slapping someone's ass. Mostly, though, this was reserved for the generally more upbeat end-of-the-day shower than the somber and dutiful early morning shower with the work day still ahead.
<br><br>
While Thirteen was content to let them continue on with their ministrations without interruption, Two grunted out a quick, "Hi" as Thirteen stepped into the shower just a few feet to her right.
<br><br>
"Hi," Thirteen offered in a non-committal tone. She felt the frigid water fall over her as she turned the shower on, and ducked her head under it quickly.
<br><br>
It wasn't that Thirteen was above masturbating in the locker room; that ship had sailed long ago, and she could likely count on at least one session of self-pleasure before the end of her shift today. But she'd gotten herself off earlier that morning, as she had every morning since sometime in early July, and Thirteen had just enough self control (or, at least, she told herself that she did) that she didn't necessarily have to climax before her shift began. It was an utterly pointless line in the sand, given the behavior of the girls around her, and the predictability of her own expected behavior a bit later in the morning. And she had failed to live up to that morning conviction already once in the last week -- losing a battle of wills with herself, and succumbing to resignation and rationalization. But in a life defined by control and surrender, Thirteen comforted herself by knowing she could at least try to exert control over this.
<br><br>
Beside her, One reached for the communal shampoo. Thirteen glanced back towards the metal desk, and -- after confirming that Mistress Zero still hadn't arrived -- decided against going through the show of shaving her pussy. She was already completely bare and stubble-free, having shaved at home that morning. But it was still a calculated risk, if Mistress Zero were to be watching on the other side of the glass. It wasn't necessarily a requirement that the girls shave every morning, only that they be completely hairless when their shifts began. Often, even when unnecessary, Thirteen still went through the exercise, as it was easier to make a show of the act than to be subjected her mistress's inspection.
<br><br>
Showering in cold water was another hardship that Thirteen had first learned to endure, and later to prefer. It woke her up in the morning, and cooled her down after running around the building at the end of the day. Even in her own apartment, Thirteen had started showering without warm water. It was, admittedly, still nerve-wracking to shave her intimate areas in cold water. But Thirteen couldn't deny that it left her with a closer shave, and she was oddly proud of how smooth her pubic area was, both visually and to the touch.
<br><br>
As she ran her fingers through her hair, Thirteen watched herself in the reflection. Given the way the locker room was exposed to the elevator lobby, the coffee cart, and the café tables, a good part of this was for her audience. The shower was still more utilitarian than for performance. The masturbation taking place at the far end of the shower block -- and Two was beginning to climax now -- was also more utilitarian than performance. Still, Thirteen found that she occasionally lingered a bit longer in the shower than she did at home, that she soaped up and washed her breasts and intimate areas a bit more than necessary, that she bent at the waist to pick up the shampoo instead of crouching and bending at the knees.
<br><br>
The thought of her audience sent a familiar tickle up her spine. Not today, she told herself. By tonight, she'd be free of ever having to shower in public again, and there was no need to give in and debase herself more than she had to. Even if she knew full well she'd be forced to touch herself later than morning. Even if she'd gotten off in the shower dozens of times in the past. Even if Two's orgasmic exhalations were turning her on.
<br><br>
Thirteen shook her head, and shampooed her hair. She made herself think of what she needed to do that night, back at her apartment, before leaving for New Haven in the morning. She knew that if she started down the path of justifying a morning session, she'd lose what little control she had. As she washed her hair, and soaped up her body, she instead went through a mental checklist of boxes she'd packed up last night and the few remaining items that needed to be packed. She was careful to avoid letting her fingers spend too much time washing her pussy, and careful to keep herself from gently pinching her straining-at-attention nipples as she rinsed herself off.
<br><br>
One was done, and turned the water off beside her. Twelve, like Thirteen, had managed to hold off any sort of intimate session with herself, and was ready to step from the shower. And Three, after letting out a deep, animal-like series of grunts - instead of the sexy, effeminate groans Two had just released - kissed her partner lovingly and was now ready to move on with her day. Thirteen hurried through the rest of her shower as new girls rotated in.
<br><br>
There was a small cubby on either end of the shower block -- four in total, in the locker room -- that held white, rough-to-the-touch bath towels, and Thirteen helped herself to one. None was big enough to be wrapped around even the smallest girl, but that was never intended to be their function. They were good enough for Thirteen to dry herself, and so she patted herself dry before depositing her towel the laundry. Thankfully, USF employed a laundry service that came weekly and kept the girls stocked with relatively clean towels; it was probably only USF's decision not to invest in on-site washers and dryers that kept this responsibility from the mailgirls themselves. Thirteen knew of a couple of girls who regularly deposited some of their own, personal laundry in with the towels; the clothes would usually come back, though sometimes they wouldn't. They'd learned not to include underwear, which was guaranteed to go missing, and be careful that they had a spare outfit available so they weren't relying on something for the commute home. Thirteen didn't care for the harsh, industrial detergents that were used, however, and she didn't trust the service even with the few pieces of laundry she wore to work that didn't need to be dry-cleaned. But when they were working upwards of seventy to eighty hours every week, Thirteen supposed she could understand the desire of some of the other girls not to spend free-time doing laundry at home, and their willingness to risk the fact that not all of it would be returned.
<br><br>
Thirteen heard Seven laugh before she saw her, and she couldn't help but feel a spike of jealousy when she turned and saw her giggling with Nineteen. Seven and Nineteen weren't a couple, not in the way that Two and Three were, certainly. But there was an intimacy there that had Thirteen feeling left out. The two girls were still fully dressed -- Nineteen in a full-on grey suit with matching blazer and skirt, Seven in a dark, work-appropriate chambray sheath dress -- and enjoying a quick conversation by Mistress Zero's desk. As she noticed Thirteen, and caught her eye, Seven smiled and waved hello, and Thirteen nearly melted.
<br><br>
Thirteen could have sworn she'd met Seven before starting at USF. Shoulder-length blonde hair, sharp chin, prominent-but-still-attractive nose defining her face, and a smile that stretched from ear-to-ear. Of course they hadn't, as Seven had been a mailgirl a week longer than Thirteen, and had been in USF's legal department before that. But there'd been something familiar about her, something that bothered Thirteen until she'd been able to put her finger on it. And it hadn't been until ESPN had been turned on above the bar, one Friday night when the girls were all out for their weekly "Bitch Session," that Thirteen had placed her -- Seven could have been a doppelganger for one of the anchors, a Lindsey Something-or-Other. Thirteen had never been big into sports, but she'd nonetheless been subjected to the daily routine of SportsCenter by a boyfriend early in graduate school, and being able to finally identify why Seven seemed so familiar had been a breakthrough.
<br><br>
Thirteen was closer with Seven than she was with any of the other mailgirls, but she couldn't say that the relationship was exactly reciprocal. It was the inherent problem in Thirteen's summer study that she was "among" the mailgirls, but not entirely "of" them. She did the same job that they did, and suffered the same indignities, embarassments, and punishments as they did. But she was here only for three months, and she was here to study them and the culture that rose up among them and around them. She was a participant, but also an observer, and it meant that the camaraderie and commiseration only went so far.
<br><br>
Some of the girls had been outright hostile to Thirteen's presence when she first started, and that hostility had lent support to her faculty advisor's suggestion that she not make her study public. Thirteen hadn't wanted to keep anything from the other girls, though, and after weathering some initial wariness and skepticism, she felt she'd made the right decision. The mailgirls had accepted her as an equal, and began opening up to her slowly. Some hoped that her short stint would allow her to blow the whistle on just how many abuses they were suffering at the hands of their corporate masters. Others were hoping that she could help explain some of their conflicting emotions, as if she were a psychoanalyst and not an anthropologist.
<br><br>
There'd never been any hesitation from Seven, though. She was open and friendly right from the get-go, and embraced Thirteen right away. She wasn't the prettiest mailgirl, or the fastest, or the most obedient, or the most willing to accept new punishments -- all of which meant that, outside the mailgirls locker room, she was neither popular nor unpopular. Inside the locker room, however, Seven was easily the most well liked, able to get along with and be accepted by everyone in a way that seemed unlikely in a group full of women. For the most part, the girls all shared a bond, and supported one another, albeit with some cattiness and cliquishness along the way. But the first two classes of mailgirls even remarked that things had seemed to get better when Seven started, when Seven had turned the occasional "drinks night" into the regular, standing Friday-night Bitch Sessions that they were. She'd share a showerhead with a girl who'd had a particularly tough day, and she'd give new girls advice on whom they could trust in the building and whom they should avoid whenever possible. She was a big sister, a coach, and a confidante, more so than any of the girls who'd joined in the first or second cohorts; Mistress Zero kept the girls motivated, but it was Seven who kept them from being out-and-out miserable on a daily basis.
<br><br>
But Seven was still fully clothed and still engaged with Nineteen, so Thirteen passed the pair by, and headed to the sinks on her end of the locker room to do her hair, brush her teeth, and put on make-up.
<br><br>
Again, there were only eight sinks for twenty-four girls, but they made it work. Lined up shoulder-to-shoulder, with a row of naked and exposed tits from left to right and right to left, the girls squeezed in and got ready for their day. They shared hairbrushes and hair dryers, lipstick and eyeliner, and even -- god help them -- toothbrushes and deodorant. They talked and gossiped as they did so, in subdued tones that gave away how much they all still dreaded the day ahead, even if they'd been a mailgirl for months upon months at that point. Few of them had much of a life outside of USF now, as run-down and beaten up as they were at the end of each day, so the conversations often revolved around the world inside the building. And, increasingly, the girls' favorite topic of conversation was a catty dissection of what other women were wearing to work.
<br><br>
"I swear to god," Twenty-One was laughing to Seventeen. "Stocking tops!"
<br><br>
Seventeen, a redhead, laughed out loud as she brushed her hair. "Like, visible? Like, that was her intention?"
<br><br>
"So, full picture," Twenty-One began again, making eye contact with Thirteen to make sure she was included. "Skin-tight white blouse with a black bra underneath -- "
<br><br>
"See-through?" Thirteen asked playfully, happy to be included.
<br><br>
"Completely visible," Twenty-One answered. Gesturing with her hands, she started at her waist and dropped one to high on her thigh. "Miniskirt. Two or three inches of leg. Stocking top."
<br><br>
Seventeen let out a goofy wolf-whistle, and Thirteen responded with a fake gasp. It was Thirteen's turn to join in, offering, "...and heels, of course."
<br><br>
Twenty-One laughed. "Of course. Stilettos."
<br><br>
That the mailgirls had the nerve to ridicule anyone's outfit was ridiculous. But while they were all technically volunteers, almost none of the girls would ever have confessed to volunteering freely; in their own minds, and to hear any of them recount how they'd landed in their current predicament, each of them had been tricked, misled, and coerced. For some of them, Thirteen knew this to be true, as she'd had access to their HR files early in her own tenure as a mailgirl. Number Four was here because she'd suffered three consecutive "poor" performance reviews, and would have been let go otherwise. Number Six had worked in the Capital Markets group, and had badly botched a trade that had cost USF close to $500K. Number Fourteen had been caught having an affair with the husband of a more senior executive in the building. For others, though, Thirteen suspected that this was a revisionist attempt to protect their own egos -- they'd been tempted by the money, or by promises of future career advancement, and had signed on not fully understanding just how bad the program could be.
<br><br>
Still, this victimhood freed them up to pass judgment on their former colleagues elsewhere in the building. After all, these other women were free to dress as they chose. And, despite this freedom, USF's female employees had been dressing increasingly provocatively and risqué since the mailgirl program first began.
<br><br>
Given what Thirteen had been wearing even just to-and-from work lately, she knew full well that she was in no position to mock others. But, she laughed along with Twenty-One and Seventeen. What she wore on her commute wasn't held to the same scrutiny among her peers; she was a mailgirl.
<br><br>
And, of course this woman had been wearing stilettos. Of course. The height of the footwear, as much as the inappropriateness ("Knee-high boots!" "Five-inch heels!"), was a favorite topic of derision among the mailgirls.
<br><br>
"Secretary? Receptionist?" Thirteen asked, knowing full well that it hadn't been. The stories were funnier and less mean-spirited when they weren't picking on one of the support staff.
<br><br>
"Marketing executive," Twenty-One laughed.
<br><br>
The trend was not unique to USF, and fairly common among companies who'd rolled out mailgirl programs of their own, regardless of nationality or culture. In fact, a good portion of Thirteen's research that summer had centered not on the mailgirls themselves, but on USF's non-mailgirl female employees. Whether it was a conscious decision or not, the launch of a mailgirl initiative always, always set off competitive behavior in other women in the workplace. From an anthropological, mate-selection standpoint, Thirteen supposed this made sense; in a world in which young, attractive co-workers were bounding about the building with tits and ass on display, the fact that an arms race had kicked off between the mailgirls and non-mailgirls was perhaps unsurprising. It didn't seem to matter if these non-mailgirls were married or not, were in a relationship or not, or even if they were consciously aware of the change in their wardrobe or not -- the end result, regardless, was that hemlines had gotten shorter, necklines had gotten lower, and heels had gotten higher. It wasn't each and every woman within USF, certainly -- but, on average, the female population of USF, even excluding the mailgirls -- was dressing sexier and more risqué as the program went on. Thirteen had even pulled security footage of the building's lobby as far back as February and March, and had begun rating women on a scale from 1-10 of how much skin they were showing when they arrived at work. She needed to do more vigorous analysis, needed to adjust for seasonality, and she supposed she could even try to measure hems and necklines caught on tape with the right resources -- but the data, as qualitative as it was, backed up her expectations.
<br><br>
On the security tapes, Thirteen had watched her own transformation. In June, she'd dressed down, and entered the building looking meek, timid, and terrified. By August, she was regularly hitting a "7" or an "8" on her own admittedly less-than-scientific "skin scale," and even her gait seemed different -- more confidence, more swagger, more presence. It was all for show -- maybe Thirteen dreaded undressing a little less each day she did so, but she still dreaded it all the same. She wondered to herself what she had looked like on the security footage today, though -- had there been a skip in her step? Had she seemed happier? Had her pace been quicker than usual? The sooner she undressed, the sooner she could get about her day, and the sooner she could put this entire ordeal behind her.
<br><br>
Any amount of confidence, swagger, and presence that Thirteen had felt that morning, though, dissipated the moment Mistress Zero entered the locker room. Standing at the mirror with the other girls, mascara brush in hand, Thirteen didn't see or hear her mistress enter the room, so much as she felt a cold shiver run up her spine. Any amount of laughter fell silent, any conversation dropped to a near-inaudible whisper. The few girls still dressed, and dawdling before getting undressed, were immediately set into motion by the invisible hand of fear. And even if Mistress Zero paid them no mind, each and every girl in that locker room was acutely aware that she was now among them.
<br><br>
She was tall -- maybe not as tall as Fifteen or Four, but above average height and taller than Thirteen, at least. She was a few years older than any of the mailgirls at USF; but even if she was closing in on forty, she was every bit as attractive as any girl in the room, and perhaps moreso than half. Dark brown hair that had pulled up in bun and high, angular cheekbones gave her an appearance of discipline and severity, which was only further underlined by her thick German accent. Human Capital, up on the 18th Floor, may have designed the mailgirl program here at USF, may have owned the metrics and analyses, and may have recruited the girls into the program, but it was Mistress Zero that made it work in practice.
<br><br>
Whereas Thirteen had HR files on each and every one of her fellow mailgirls, and while she'd been able to pull files on other employees who caught her interest or whom she thought might be relevant to her research, Will Barrow and his Human Capital team had given her nothing on the dominatrix who so terrorized the girls. Thirteen understood the logic; as "apart" as she might have been from the other mailgirls, Thirteen was still a mailgirl herself, and Mistress Zero's authority and discipline was fundamental in understanding the mindset of the girls.
<br><br>
Still, Thirteen's research in other mailgirl programs throughout the country and abroad had been extensive, and it hadn't taken much digging for her to identify Mistress Zero as none other than "Mailgirl Funf" at an Investment Bank in Frankfurt; most companies kept extensive files, complete with photographs, of their mailgirls. Her name had, at least at one time, been Mila Bluhm. But Mistress Zero's real name seemed as important as Thirteen's; which was to say, not at all. The fact that she had herself been a mailgirl had humanized her a bit to Thirteen, but it also made her transition to dungeon master that much more perplexing; given that she had faced many of the same trials and humiliations as the girls at USF, shouldn't that have made her more sympathetic to their plight? There was no documentation around Funf's transition to Zero, about whether the role had been lined up between the companies, or if USF had hired her directly. But, over time, Thirteen came to realize that despite the torment, despite the punishments, despite the discipline, Mistress Zero was almost every bit as important to the mailgirl program as the mailgirls themselves; she was every bit a part of the show as the girls.
<br><br>
There were countless mailgirl programs that were run on a day-to-day basis by men. Some had been selected by higher-ups to run the daily operations, some had been rewarded with the role, and more than a few just happened to be working their company's mailroom when the program rolled out. Thirteen laughed at the idea that any mailgirl program could be respectable, per se, but most of the more "respectable" programs had tapped women to oversee and keep order. It made sense to Thirteen; given the paddlings and spankings, the intimate inspections, and the escalation of psychological torment, it made the abuse -- lower-case "a" -- seem less like Abuse -- capital "a" -- to the audience. Even at USF, most of the rules and regulations were established by the small team of men up on the 18th Floor, but it was Mistress Zero who carried them out. No doubt she had improvised a punishment or two over the course of the summer, or meted out a penalty when Human Capital might have advised her to let it go, but Thirteen suspected that her Mistress grasped a central truth about the mailgirls concept that still continued to elude a small handful of Thirteen's fellow mailgirls: they weren't here to deliver the mail. No, rather, it was the debasement of the girls themselves that was the true service their department was providing the company.
<br><br>
"Good morning, mistress," Thirteen finally heard, as Number Fourteen entered the locker room.
<br><br>
If Mistress Zero had so much as grunted a response in Fourteen's direction, Thirteen didn't hear it.
<br><br>
As Fourteen, behind her, began undressing at her locker, Thirteen focused on her own reflection in the mirror, and what she had to do to get ready for the day. Seventeen and Twenty-One continued to giggle and whisper back and forth, but it was with nowhere near the same volume or glee as it had been before.
<br><br>
Hair dried, brushed, and pulled back into a ponytail. Teeth brushed with a purple toothbrush that had been handed to her by Fifteen, barely rinsed. Deodorant applied with a stick that had been handed to her by Seventeen, still warm from Seventeen's own body. Cheap, flowery "mailgirl perfume" misted over her bare body. A subtle, barely noticeable amount of make-up applied. Thirteen puckered her lips, offered a subdued-but-playful kiss in the direction of Twenty-One's reflection, and excused herself to the row of toilets in the hallway next to her locker.
<br><br>
The fact that Mistress Zero's cold, utilitarian metal desk was the seat of power in the locker room, and the fact that it sat directly in front of the toilets the girls all used, always caused the girls to laugh in private. She herself used a more private women's room around the corner, in the lobby for the service elevators, but she was still forced to sit fifteen-maybe-twenty feet away as her girls emptied their bladders. Fifteen, in particular, seemed to delight in that fact, and viewed every opportunity to use the toilet when Mistress Zero was present as some small enactment of vengeance.
<br><br>
The German woman was sitting with her back to hallway, facing the locker room entrance, and flipping through files and statistics on her tablet as Thirteen tried to pass by. But Mistress Zero lifted her head, and Thirteen cringed when she caught her eye.
<br><br>
"Good morning, mistress," Thirteen offered, hoping that she could pass to toilets without anything more needing to be said.
<br><br>
"Thirteen," Mistress Zero responded, her lips offering a cruel smile, her eyes hinting a mischief. "Today's your last day with us here at the Plaza."
<br><br>
That's the plan, Thirteen thought to herself. She offered only, "Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
"You'll miss us," the woman stated. It wasn't a question.
<br><br>
"Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
She nodded to her tablet. "I see twenty-one demerits since Tuesday." Again, it wasn't a question. But, this time, a threat was implied.
<br><br>
"Yes, mistress," Thirteen replied, without committing to anything further. New punishments and humiliations were thought up and applied almost arbitrarily, but the one thing that any girl could count on was corporal punishment at every interval of twenty-five demerits. A good day -- for Thirteen, at least -- was four or five; she averaged probably closer to nine or ten. What that meant was that it was unlikely she'd make it through the day without one last visit to the leather bench, one last punishment at Mistress Zero's hand.
<br><br>
Her mistress looked her up and down, and then turned her attention back to the tablet. For a moment, Thirteen hoped that would be all, and she'd be allowed to pee without further comment. But it was unlike Mistress Zero to let her go with just that, and true to form, she said, "Let's try to be a good girl today, or I'll send you off with something to remember me by."
<br><br>
Thirteen swallowed hard. It was unlikely she'd be forgetting Mistress Zero anytime soon, regardless. But she understood, nodded, and offered one last, meek, "Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
So excused, Thirteen padded past the desk, and up into hallway. She took a seat on the toilet closest to her, directly across from where Number Six was relieving herself, still dressed but with her skirt hiked and panties at her ankles. Unfortunately, unlike those moments when a girl was masturbating and the others left her to herself, toilet etiquette provided for no such moments of unspoken-but-agreed-upon attempts to feign privacy. Six smiled at, softly greeted her with a "hi," and said, "I can't believe it's your last day."
<br><br>
As she peed, Thirteen shook her head and said, "Neither can I."
<br><br>
"You don't think she's going to try to keep you here for one last Saturday shift?" Six asked in a whisper, gesturing to Mistress Zero with her head. The older woman might have been able to hear the question, but she didn't look up from her work.
<br><br>
Thirteen wouldn't have put it past her. Fall Term didn't start until Tuesday of next week, and Thirteen could have conceivably worked one last Saturday before returning to New Haven -- even if it violated the contract she and Gillian had signed with USF. But, no, Mistress Zero posted the Saturday shift girls on Thursday afternoons, and Thirteen hadn't been on that list last night. And, besides, Thirteen had spent more than her fair of Saturdays here at the Plaza. "I don't think so," was all Thirteen offered in response.
<br><br>
"But you're still coming to the Bitch Session tonight?"
<br><br>
This made Thirteen smile. "I wouldn't dare miss it," she answered. This would be her last night out for drinks with the other girls, and she understood that Seven was making sure just about everyone would be there -- even Five and Eight, neither of whom usually participated.
<br><br>
It was Seven who had turned irregular nights out for drinks into the standing, Friday-night tradition that they'd become, but it was Fourteen who'd bequeathed upon that tradition the name. True, half the girls would be required to show up to the Plaza the following day, for the pared-down Saturday shift. But the end of the week felt freeing nonetheless to them all, and it had become an opportunity for them to go out, collectively, and blow off steam. Rare did the topic of conversation stray from their lives as mailgirls, and Mistress Zero received a good portion of the girls' ire in absentia. With a drink or two in their systems, and a weekend to look forward to, the girls were almost able to laugh at themselves, and joke about the misery they'd suffered that week.
<br><br>
For Thirteen, the Bitch Sessions had become an invaluable research tool. The girls opened up about their situation, about what they were feeling on a day-to-day basis, about what it meant to be a mailgirl. Thirteen, often a little buzzed, did her best to jot down notes and reconstruct confessions when she got home later that night, and then clean them up on Sundays prior to a weekly check-in call with Gillian.
<br><br>
No one really had a life outside of being a mailgirl; even fully dressed, even away from the Plaza, even on a night in which many of them had entire weekend ahead of them, they were still mailgirls. It was impossible to date and meet someone new; how did you explain what you did for a living? Most of the girls who volunteered for the program were single at the time, and those few girls who'd been seeing someone typically saw that relationship fall apart within a few weeks; Twenty-Four had only just broken up with her boyfriend -- of two years -- a week ago. Most nights, a mailgirl returned home exhausted both physically and emotionally, beaten up in every sense of the word. And even on weekends, and even if she wasn't working a Saturday shift, a good portion of a mailgirl's time was devoted to something mailgirl-related: tanning, grooming, or even bleaching (Thirteen's asshole puckered just at the thought of that new, fresh hell of her expected hygiene). Thirteen often went stir crazy without a long run on the treadmill in her building's gym -- barefoot, of course. There were the occasional nights and weekends where Thirteen found herself wondering why she ever bothered going home; she might have been better served sleeping at the Plaza.
<br><br>
So it wasn't surprising that they'd spend most of a Friday night telling each other stories about their week at work. At the start of night, the Bitch Sessions truly earned their name -- the girls were negative, angry, and miserable. But horror stories and fresh embarassments were recounted in such a way that they were often delivered with a "can-you-believe-it" style of storytelling, and a laughing commiseration began to lift their collective spirits. The girls shared stories of having their nipples tweaked or asses pinched; both were violations of company policy, but regularly overlooked when it came to the senior staff. They tried to one-up one another with accounts of such miserable things being said to them that it became funny (notably, by Paul Hooper in the actual mailroom), or interactions with colleagues with whom they'd worked in their prior jobs. And then inevitably, at some point, someone would confess to getting turned on by some humiliation or punishment that any one of them would have recoiled from prior to becoming a mailgirl; this, instead, would be met with laughs and nods, and another, more X-rated game of one-upsmanship.
<br><br>
Despite being objectified and sexualized at USF all week long, Friday nights were more than just an emotional release for many of the girls. Even the girls who showed up in sweats or jeans or yoga pants at USF tended to dress up for Friday's night out, and more than a few among them went out without underwear. Four, Fourteen, and Twenty each had a string of one-night-stands that they picked up on Friday nights, and most of the girls had at least one such night themselves; Thirteen was among this latter group, but had done it only once, finding it awkward, out-of-character, and unsatisfying. More common were the girls who went home with each other; jokingly referring to themselves as "letter-carrying lesbians," most had no experience with another girl or any bisexual leanings prior to becoming a mailgirl, but found in one another understanding, acceptance, and shared experience. Thirteen, for a time, had been part of this group, as well. And, finally, there was a particular booth at the Imperial Hotel's bar that was out-of-the-way and poorly lit. It was nicknamed by the girls -- wildly, inaccurately - the "kissing booth," and a girl (or two) could get herself off while a friend served as look-out. Thirteen had to admit that she'd participated in this particular exercise, too.
<br><br>
Earlier in the summer, Thirteen had hated herself for such behavior, hated that she'd that she'd descended into this level of depravity. It wasn't enough for her, apparently, that she had been stripped naked at USF, been subjected to spankings and paddlings and other such torments, and been humiliated time and time and time again. The eye-opening revelation of the summer had been how much she seemed to get off on it all, and how much she needed -- needed! -- to touch herself because of it.
<br><br>
Thirteen wasn't alone in hating herself. Almost all of the girls felt the same way. Which, in and of itself, was a way out of that very same anguish. Very few of them would have confessed to being exhibitionists coming into the program, but the exhibition was having the same effect on them all -- even on girls like Twenty-Four, who refused to act on that arousal (at least, in public). This realization, this shared experience, was freeing in its own way: Thirteen wasn't a pervert or a deviant, but rather reacting to her current situation in a very normal way, in a way that twenty-some other girls were reacting here at USF alone, in a way that countless other mailgirls were reacting worldwide. And it opened them all up to be honest about themselves, about what turned them on, and even about the individual kinks and quirks that were unique to them.
<br><br>
For instance, Six had confessed she now had a difficult time peeing when no one was watching. Thirteen, at that moment, was providing the audience that Six needed.
<br><br>
But Thirteen finished, nodded a "goodbye" in Six's direction, and headed back to her locker.
<br><br>
The locker room could be loud and rowdy at times - usually at the tail end of the day, when the amount of time between the end of a mailgirl shift and the start of a mailgirl shift the next day was at its greatest. Most mornings -- and this morning was no different, despite Thirteen's impending freedom -- were more subdued, especially with Mistress Zero present. There were whispers and quiet conversations, to be sure, and there was a soft murmur throughout the locker room that reminded Thirteen of one of the libraries back in New Haven. But as Thirteen reached for the smartphone that sat charging in her locker, she thought to herself that, despite the misery and negativity the accompanied most mornings, she was going to miss the particular and peculiar combination of excitement and dread that was central to life as a mailgirl.
<br><br>
Thirteen had input her arrival time into the unit with a simple thumbprint that morning, and she awoke the unit with her thumbprint again now. It was one of the few, rare times she was even allowed to touch the device, which she'd come to regard and respect as her "electronic leash"; most of the time, it sat in a lycra arm-band around her left bicep, and was available only so that those sending and receiving messages, mail, or interoffice deliveries could "bump" their own smart device against it for instructions or information. It proudly displayed the number thirteen for most of the day, but at the moment it was open for morning inputs.
<br><br>
The first screen that popped up was Thirteen's morning affirmation. "I swear, under the penalty of the law, that I submit under my own free will..." She clicked "accept" without scrolling further. She'd read it all before, and iterations of the same message in her research into other programs before. Essentially, it assured the company that her participation in the mailgirls program today was entirely of her own choosing, that she was a volunteer, that she could walk away at any time, that she was allowing herself to become subject to whatever USF threw at her that day, that she wasn't being blackmailed or coerced into this life, and yadda yadda yadda. It was mostly bullshit; of course she was being coerced, she thought to herself, as she remembered Gillian's runaround with Guy Dubuc. Just as any other girl was being coerced ("incentivized" was Human Capital's term for it) by onerous contracts that could cripple her financially and career-wise for years to come. But by signing and swearing each morning, Thirteen was creating a digital record of her acceptance and submission, one that USF was sure to throw back in face if challenged in court. Sure, any of the girls could theoretically click "decline," instead. But, five months into the program here at USF, few had yet dared to.
<br><br>
Next, Thirteen carried the unit over to one of two digital scales in front of Mistress Zero's desk, and patiently waited behind Fifteeen and Sixteen for her morning weigh-in. Mistress Zero barely glanced up as each girl stepped on the scale and offered a "Good morning, mistress." Thirteen, though, again got a devious smile when she took her turn and offered, "Good morning again, mistress." Maybe it was just in regards to the unavoidable spanking coming her way, or maybe Human Capital had one last humiliation to inflict upon her before she left today, but Thirteen knew that something cruel and unusual was coming her way. Whatever it was, she reassured herself that by that by tonight the entire ordeal would be behind her.
<br><br>
The smartphone chimed, indicating it had synched with the scale, and Thirteen glanced down at stepped off. She smiled to herself, as she was down half a pound since yesterday. Not so much for the negligible weight loss, but for the fact that she remained within the narrow band of "acceptable" weight fluctuation. Too heavy, and she'd be given half-rations at lunch, in addition to a demerit. Too light, and it was a demerit and a double ration.
<br><br>
Returning to her locker, Thirteen slipped the lycra armband over her left hand, up over her forearm, and snapped it snugly in place around her bicep. She then inserted the smartphone into the band, touching it for the last time until she needed to take another shower.
<br><br>
Not only did the device synch with the scale, but it also uploaded to the mailgirls app accessible to every USF employee in the building. Anyone who logged in from their own laptop, desktop, or smart device would see how much Thirteen weighed that morning, and could pull up historic data about how much she had weighed yesterday, the day before, or three months prior. Thanks to a pedometer in the device, it tracked how many steps Thirteen made on a daily basis. Height. BMI. Hair color. Eye color. Measurements. Cup-size. Dress size. Shoe size. Birthday. Age. Sexual preference (confusing as that might have been for Thirteen at the time). Place of birth. She had to have someone log every bathroom break between 7am and 7pm. She had to confess every masturbation session here at USF with Mistress Zero, who logged it and made it available to anyone and everyone with the app. If she were on her period, Mistress Zero needed to know; and, rather than being taken out of circulation, she was given a tampon and "red-flagged" in the system for everyone to see. Even though she was required to correct anyone who used it, and forbidden from using it herself, her given name was on there. And, for no reason other than pure cruelty, the girls were forced to provide their mother's full name, as well.
<br><br>
Thirteen's mother, Catherine Ruth Ryan, knew nothing about the part she played in this little game.
<br><br>
The lycra armband and the smartphone weren't the entirety of Thirteen's mailgirl "uniform," however. No, her get-up wasn't complete until she'd heard the soul-crushing click of the metal collar around her neck. One part dog-collar, one part choker, and one part lifted directly from some of the deepest, darkest corners of the Internet, Thirteen's collar seemed to hammer home the fact that she was enslaving herself to USF. The nudity, apparently, wasn't enough; the collar took her current enforced nudity and exhibitionist predicament and sent it careening down the path towards bondage and discipline, with a bit of sadomasochism mixed in for good measure. It could only be unlocked at the end of the day by Mistress Zero, or some lucky designee she assigned responsibility to for a particular night. But, it was left unlocked in each girl's locker every night, and every morning they'd be required to put it back on before they got into position. The keyhole was hardly noticeable; instead, it was the #13 dog tag, and the D-rings affixed around the circumference of the collar, that caught one's eye.
<br><br>
Thirteen had been forced to wear the collar home one Thursday night in late July, a punishment for some minor, trumped-up offense that she could no longer recall. Had it been any other night, she might have been able to just hide in her apartment until the next morning. But the fact that her little sister Sophie had been visiting from LA at the time turned just another day-in-the-life embarrassment of a mailgirl into something even more deeply humiliating.
<br><br>
Thirteen shivered at the memory.
<br><br>
The collar, naturally, came with a leash. Like the collar, it was metal, ugly, and medieval-looking, with thick, heavy links. One end was affixed, permanently, to the floor of Thirteen's open locker. The other? Thirteen had the honor of hooking it through the D-ring on the back of her own collar. She listened for the next click, indicating that it, too, had been locked, and that she'd only be freed when Mistress Zero decided it was time for her to be freed. The chain leash had only enough slack that Thirteen could stand directly in front of her locker, and stray no further.
<br><br>
But Thirteen didn't need to stay standing; she could "rest" until Mistress Zero came by for her inspection. And so, the blonde girl got her knees, with her back to her open locker and the clothes she'd shed that morning. She sat back upon her haunches, in what would be her standard position of the day. Per her training, it was simply referred to as "Knees" here at USF, but she knew that other programs referred to it as "Resting Position" or "Mailgirl Kneeling Position" or even "Nadu" (something apparently lifted from Gorean sub-culture). Both arms behind her back, with the back of her right hand resting against the very top her ass, and her right hand grasping her left wrist. Legs at the very least shoulder-length apart, with her shaven pussy so prominently on display that she imagined her swollen clit was practically throbbing and glowing for all to see. Back ever-so-slightly arched, pushing her breasts out. Eyes cast downward, focused on an imaginary spot four feet in front of her, in a show of submission.
<br><br>
It had taken Thirteen, for some reason, longer than most to learn her positions; or, at the very least to get them right. She had thought that Mistress Zero was picking on her initially, putting the PhD candidate among the mailgirls in her place, driving home just how stupid Thirteen really was. She wasn't arching her back just right. She wasn't spreading her knees far enough apart. She was making too much eye contact. By the time she'd finally gotten "Knees" correct, her ass had been spanked raw, and she swore she'd never be able to sit down in a chair again. Maybe that had been the point.
<br><br>
She spent a significant portion of her day on her feet, dashing from one delivery to the next, with hardly more than a few minutes' rest here or there. Even in those rare moments where USF employees didn't have a delivery for her to make, or a memo for her to distribute, or an important message they needed to be assured a colleague would pay attention to, Mistress Zero and Human Capital kept her busy delivering supplies, keeping conference rooms stocked and maintained, and otherwise doing odd jobs. But, every now and then she was just lucky enough to catch a breather, and it was most often in the "Knees" position. In just three months Thirteen had begun to find the position both restorative and oddly comfortable.
<br><br>
In addition to the "Knees" position, there was "Feet." And "Toes," which was also referred to as the "Inspection Position." There was "Hands-and-Knees," as well as "Elbows-and-Knees" and "Forehead-and-Knees." There were countless others. And then there was what the mailgirls themselves jokingly referred to as "Back" - not an official position, but one which was a common position in the locker room nonetheless, with proper hand placement rubbing desperately back-and-forth between one's legs.
<br><br>
Thirteen wasn't the first girl in position that morning, but she was among the first few, as usual. Others -- Fourteen, for example -- were still in the shower, and still had hair and make-up to do, affirmations to proclaim, and weigh-ins to complete. Thirteen couldn't do it; in those few occasions when she'd been running a bit behind, she had felt a pit a dread in her stomach as she raced against the clock to get to her knees in front of her locker. After the first few days as a mailgirl, it was rare that any of the girls weren't in position when inspections began. But, all the same, Thirteen preferred to have a few minutes to herself, to sit quietly, and to steel herself for the day.
<br><br>
Most mornings, Thirteen forced herself to "power down" her higher brain functions -- they did her no good as a mailgirl. Whoever she'd been before arriving at the Plaza that morning had no bearing on her ability to do her job quickly, effectively, and submissively. She entered an almost meditative state in which her whole being was consumed by the orders delivered to her via the smartphone affixed to her arm. It was freeing, in its way, and Thirteen had read countless confessions and testimonies of current and former mailgirls who felt the same way. Gone were worries over bills or debt or anything else intruding from the outside world. Gone was stress over impending project deadlines or contracts to be reviewed or clients to be kept happy or -- in Thirteen's case -- research still to be done. Even the embarrassment over her nudity, the humiliation from drinking out of a dog bowl, the shame of being subjected to corporal punishment -- she could accept it almost robotically, detached as if it were happening to someone else.
<br><br>
Today, however, was a bit different, and Thirteen's mind was racing. She knew she had a spanking coming to her -- it was inescapable. She knew that Mistress Zero had something new, cruel, and unusual waiting for her, a parting gift to remember her by. She knew she still had an entire day of abuse in front of her. But she'd endure, as she'd endured for three months to that point, and by tomorrow, all of this would be behind her. Twelve-hours-and-change from now, she'd put her clothes on and walk out of the Plaza for the last time, never to return. It was, for most mailgirls, a crueler torture than most -- hope.
<br><br>
Jolting her back to the present, however, came a rough tug upwards on her leash. She'd somehow lost track of time, so consumed by her thoughts of returning to Connecticut. The locker room was now silent, and all twenty-four girls had taken their place in front of their lockers. Fourteen, now stark naked and costumed in the same armband and collar as the rest of the girls, was on her knees beside her. Mistress Zero was in front of Thirteen, jerking the blonde girl to her feet by her leash, and barking out simply, "Toes."
<br><br>
"Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
Thirteen did as she was told. She rose to her feet, and then up on tip-toes -- instinctively keeping her legs about three feet apart. She put both hands behind her head, elbows out, and then interlocked her fingers. She stared straight ahead, eyes fixed forward, and locked eyes with her own reflection in the mirror-glass across the room. She made no attempt to look at Mistress Zero, but instead gritted her teeth and waited for her mistress's touch.
<br><br>
Mistress Zero didn't disappoint. She dropped her hold on Thirteen's leash and immediately grasped the girl's left nipple between her thumb and forefinger, pinching it violently. She repeated the exercise on the right. Most USF employees would be reprimanded and punished harshly for touching a mailgirl like this (punished, that is, with a written warning or a termination -- not a paddling or spanking as a mailgirl might expect). But Mistress Zero was given nearly carte blanche to do to the girls whatever she pleased, to keep them motivated and performing, to instill a level of terror in them that kept them in line. That she was performing for an audience, as well, wasn't lost on Thirteen.
<br><br>
If Thirteen's nipples hadn't already been hard and standing at attention before, they certainly would have been now.
<br><br>
The intimate abuse didn't stop there. Mistress Zero performed a "sniff test," making sure Thirteen smelled of soap and shampoo and deodorant, and faintly of perfume, and the sensation of the woman's warm breath on Thirteen's bare skin caused similarly warm sensations to begin percolating up from inside of her. It didn't help, then, when the German woman ran a finger along the bare skin above Thirteen's pussy to check for stubble, and then roughly cupped the girl's sex with her hand -- probing either side of her slit with her fingers to make sure Thirteen was fully in compliance with the hairless policy.
<br><br>
Thirteen shivered with the familiar mixture of terror and excitement.
<br><br>
Mistress Zero had performed that same exercise on twelve girls before her, and would perform it upon the next eleven girls down the line. It was hardly sanitary, but Thirteen doubted the older woman, or the men in Human Capital who oversaw her, were overly concerned.
<br><br>
With her right thumbprint, Mistress Zero activated Thirteen's smartphone, never bothering to remove it from the girl's armband. There was a mild vibration, and Thirteen felt the counter begin to tick down towards seven o'clock.
<br><br>
"Feet."
<br><br>
"Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
Heels on the floor. Arms behind her back, right hand grasping her right wrist. Eyes cast downward in submission.
<br><br>
Mistress Zero circled behind her to inspect her from behind. This was standard procedure. "Ankles," she instructed. This was not.
<br><br>
"Yes mistress."
<br><br>
Legs apart, bent at the waist, each hand around an ankle.
<br><br>
Though hardly a part of Mistress Zero's normal morning routine, "Ankles" was still a position the girls were expected to know and take, if instructed. At least here in the locker room, it was more commonly asked of new mailgirls -- partly to make sure they'd been properly bleached, partly to further break their spirits. It was fairly uncommon throughout the rest of the building, though Thirteen had still been asked to take the position just last week, by a particularly cruel junior executive in Middle Market Financing, upset at Thirteen for being only a few seconds late with a memo. This, now, was similarly nothing more than cruelty, Mistress Zero's way of letting Thirteen know she was still in charge.
<br><br>
At least for today.
<br><br>
For newer mailgirls, Mistress Zero actually made a show of spreading their cheeks for a closer inspection. Fifteen had snickered that this couldn't have been particularly enjoyable for the German woman, either. Today, at least, Mistress Zero decided that the position was humiliating enough, and walked back around to in front of Thirteen. Roughly (as she rarely did anything gently), she grabbed the blonde girl by the hair, and removed the elastic that held her ponytail in place.
<br><br>
"I think pigtails today," she said.
<br><br>
Fine, Thirteen thought to herself, before mewing, "Yes, mistress."
<br><br>
Standard, for Thirteen, was a ponytail. Other girls wore their hair up in a bun. Still others just let their hair flow freely as they dashed from one mailstop to the next. It was one of those rare freedoms of choice they were allowed, for some inexplicable reason. Only occasionally did Mistress Zero decide to weigh in -- but she did, from time to time. Twelve's pixie cut was an attestation to that fact. As was the fact that Thirteen would be bounding around the Plaza today with her hair done up like a kindergartner's.
<br><br>
No matter. She'd do what she was told. It made not one lick of difference if she objected or protested, so she didn't bother giving it another thought. Once her inspection was completed, she'd put her hair up in pigtails.
<br><br>
"Up," Mistress Zero instructed, pulling her up by her hair. "Feet."
<br><br>
"Yes, mistress," Thirteen replied.
<br><br>
Heels on the floor. Arms behind her back. Eyes cast downward.
<br><br>
Mistress Zero produced a felt-tip marker, and traced a fresh number thirteen over the ever-so-slightly faded number thirteen already written on Thirteen's right hip.
<br><br>
"I don't know why they don't let us just tattoo you girls," the woman mused.
<br><br>
Thirteen hadn't encountered any mailgirl program going that far -- yet. But she had read accounts of former mailgirls doing just that, of getting tattooed with their former numbers once liberated. It was maybe one part a badge of honor, that a girl had endured all of the torture and humiliation and come out the other side. But it was likely also one part a reminder to never, never fall victim to a mailgirls contract again. Thirteen was happy to soon be rid of hers.
<br><br>
They'd been recruited in classes when the mailgirls program had rolled out at USF. One, Three, Five, and Six, as well as the original numbers Two and Four, had all been assigned their numbers when the first wave started in April. Then came the original number Seven, whom Thirteen had never met, as well as Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve in May. Thirteen had been assigned her number as the first member of the June class, along with five other girls, Fourteen through Eighteen. Unlike the two previous classes, the June group hadn't yet lost a single girl. Even the July wave, Nineteen through Twenty-Four, couldn't say the same -- they'd lost the original number Twenty-Three just two weeks ago.
<br><br>
Thirteen's number was her identity at this point. She'd read of companies randomly assigning numbers daily, to keep that very thing from happening - to strip everything away from a girl, to keep her from being anything but simply a mailgirl, to make sure she knew her place. Thankfully, however, USF didn't have to go that far to make sure Thirteen knew her place. If the fact that she was naked here at the Plaza weren't enough, the collar and leash hammered that message home.
<br><br>
Mistress Zero unlocked the leash from the collar with a key she kept on her wrist. Patting Thirteen on the ass, she dismissed her. The inspection was through, Thirteen had passed, and now she had been tasked with doing her hair up in pigtails. Mistress Zero, meanwhile, moved on to Fourteen, to perform more-or-less the same inspection.
<br><br>
It was odd, at least in the morning pre-shift, to be alone at the sink counter. Behind her, in the reflection, Thirteen could the other girls -- Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and so on -- lined up at their lockers. Fourteen was standing on her toes, hands behind her head and elbows out, while Mistress Zero looked her over. The others were on their knees, hands behind their backs, and eyes down facing the floor. Thirteen didn't linger in doing her hair; there was something discomforting about being free while the rest of the mailgirls were locked up. She felt a pang of guilt in that discomfort, the thought of leaving all of her fellow mailgirls behind when she returned to Connecticut. She decided not linger on the guilt, either.
<br><br>
Hair now up in two matching pigtails, Thirteen returned to her locker. Mistress Zero had progressed further down the line, and was in the middle of inspecting Twenty-One, whom she'd been harder on -- deservedly, in most of the girls' opinions -- over the last few weeks. Thirteen, though, paid the inspection no mind, instead reattaching her own leash to her collar. After the familiar "click" of the lock, she took her place on her knees, and sat back on her heels with her hands behind her. She glanced down, awkwardly, at the smartphone on her arm.
<br><br>
Another seven minutes and thirteen seconds before seven o'clock.
<br><br>
She stared down, blankly, at the tiled floor in front of her, fixating on one particular spot. The seconds ticked by, and Thirteen comforted herself with the fact that every minute, every second, that passed got her closer to the end of the day. The end of her time at USF. The end of her life among the mailgirls.<br><br><br><br>

<p>
Mailgirl Number Thirteen knelt, naked, on the middle of a well-decorated office on the 26th Floor of US Financial Plaza. Her head was bowed, and she stared emptily at a point on the carpet a few feet in front of her; a mailgirl dared not to make eye contact with her superiors without express permission. Her arms were behind her, her right hand locked around her left wrist. But her shoulders were back, so as to better project her naked breasts into the room. She was on her knees, with her thighs spread so that her bare pussy – warm, wet, and expectant – was entirely exposed. Her buttocks were back on her ankles, so that she could rest.<br>
<br>
In front of her loomed the desk of Joe Hoblitzel, an Executive Vice President in USF's Asset Management group. He sat, mostly ignoring her, while he bounced between typing something on his desktop and flipping through pages of the Wall Street Journal. He was middle-aged – late forties, maybe early fifties – but handsome nonetheless. Dark hair, dressed in an expensive suit, with a strong, clean-shaven jawline and a solid build. He was too old for her, of course – almost twice her age – but the twenty-six-year-old couldn't help but find him attractive. He reminded her, ever-so-slightly, of her step-father – a realization that, once made, somehow only made him that much more attractive in an honest-but-uncomfortable way.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had been coming to Hoblitzel's office regularly, for the better part of the last month, but she still couldn't have explained exactly what his job was. He was in Asset Management, she knew, and he had a team of portfolio managers that all rolled up under him; she'd be making the rounds to them next. Number Three could have told her, if she'd asked, as Three had worked in this department before "volunteering" to become a mailgirl. But Thirteen had replaced Three in this little morning exercise that Hoblitzel put her through each and every day. And, as much as Three was probably relieved by the fact that she no longer had to routinely traipse through her old department in the nude, Thirteen didn't want to tip her own hand, and accidentally give Three the impression that she actually enjoyed her mornings on the 26th Floor.<br>
<br>
Because, even though she was loathe to admit it, Thirteen's mornings with Hoblitzel were the best part of her day at the Plaza. He was kind to her, relatively speaking, even if it was in a dominating and sometimes demeaning way. Sure, he'd pat her on the ass on the way out, an act that was technically against the rules but often overlooked – especially among executives at his level. But he meant it as both a compliment and a sign of encouragement. And he often had a piece of hard candy for her – peppermint today. Which, although being the smallest of kindnesses and although she to take it out of his hand with her mouth only, was nonetheless a rare kindness in the life of a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
The truth was, if Joe Hoblitzel had unzipped his fly, and produced his cock, Thirteen might have happily taken that into her mouth, as well.<br>
<br>
Luckily, Thirteen had not been faced with that temptation. Even among the most senior staff, full-fledged sexual activity with the mailgirls was strictly, strictly forbidden – even outside of work hours. Any such act would result in immediate dismissal of the colleague involved, and an investigation into the direct supervisor and the department itself for letting such an act occur. And then, since there was almost no way a mailgirl could actually be fired, that mailgirl (and her peers) would be punished severely.<br>
<br>
There were flaws in that system, of course, as Twenty-One had exposed a few weeks prior. Namely, follow-up required a mailgirl, the lowliest of lowliest within the company, to come forward and report the incident. Thankfully, none of the girls – Thirteen included – had yet been the victim of such an act; even in Twenty-One's case, it had been Twenty-One herself who'd initiated the "relationship." A pinch or a pat on the ass here or there, a tweaked nipple from a particularly bold executive, an intentional-but-made-to-look-inadvertent brushing up against a naked girl's body? Sure. Of course. But, certainly nothing that rose to the level of the horror stories Thirteen had read about elsewhere; USF's program was a nunnery, comparatively speaking.<br>
<br>
But Thirteen knew just how slippery that particular slope was. And the reality of the situation was that at least half of the girls – again, Thirteen included – might have accepted complete and total sexual slavery if it were to be asked of them. Not because they'd been so humiliated and beaten down, because they had. Not because they increasingly thought of themselves as full and unconditional property belonging to USF, because they did. But, rather, because they all confessed to just how turned on they got as mailgirls.<br>
<br>
For Thirteen, it was no different. If Hoblitzel had called her to him, bent her over the desk, and began laying into her, Thirteen would have accepted happily. She couldn't deny just how sexually excited she was at that moment, kneeling naked and submissive in a powerful executive's office. The fact that he was pretending to ignore her only made it hotter, somehow. She was wet – not unusual for her, granted – so wet that she could detect her own scent. She wondered if Hoblitzel could, too.<br>
<br>
It was a bit of a status symbol among executive management just how long they could hold onto a girl. The mailgirls were expected to deliver the regular mail and interoffice to anyone and everyone, but it cost a certain amounts of credits (or, "chits," as they were called here at USF) to send memos via mailgirl. Executives were granted significantly more chits than the masses, and they could up their spend in the system for a "rush" delivery – ensuring that a mailgirl was forced into a full-on sprint to hit her deadline, and almost guaranteeing she'd receive a demerit or two. They could also utilize their chits to hold a girl in their presence for longer than might have otherwise been required. The concept had been to keep a girl in place until an employee finished a last-minute memo, but in practice it had become a bit of a pissing contest among certain department heads.<br>
<br>
It had been just past eight when Thirteen entered Hoblitzel's office. Though she didn't dare look up at the clock on the wall now, she guessed she'd been here the better part of half an hour.<br>
<br>
In Hoblitzel's case, Thirteen believed it was less about proving his status, and more about Thirteen herself. At least, that's what she liked to believe. He'd summon her (always Thirteen, specifically) to his office each morning, and have her wait while he flipped through the news and composed a memo to his senior staff about trends and things to look out for that day. And then he'd send her on her way, to make her rounds through Asset Management and his direct reports. Nothing he sent couldn't have been delivered via email, but Hoblitzel felt – as the program intended – that his team would pay more focused attention if the message were delivered by a naked mailgirl.<br>
<br>
And, as attracted as Thirteen was to Hoblitzel, she told herself it was mutual. He used to task Three with the same job, dashing from desk to desk to desk and delivering Hoblitzel's musings on the market to her former peers. But whether he'd felt some pang of empathy for the girl and freed her from the routine, or whether he'd just happened to notice Thirteen on an unrelated mail run and decided to upgrade, he had never kept Three in his office as long as he regularly did Thirteen.<br>
<br>
Thirteen felt his eyes on her. He glanced up at her every now and then, as if looking for inspiration, before returning to his work.<br>
<br>
In another life, Thirteen could have dominated him and wrapped him around her finger. She was young, she was blonde, she was pretty, and she knew that she had something he wanted. He'd buy her presents. Treat her to a dinner date. Take her out dancing. Beg, beg, beg for a night with her, for the honor of going down on her, for a sniff of her pussy. Thirteen, of course, had never been that girl; but still, she fantasized about holding someone like Hoblitzel in the palm of her hand.<br>
<br>
But, if Thirteeen was being honest with herself – and being stripped of everything, from her clothes, to her identity, to her very personality, forced a liberating sort of honesty – dominating Hoblitzel didn't turn her on half as much as being dominated by him now. It was an uncomfortable thing she'd learned about herself over the summer, an uncomfortable realization that most of the other girls shared with her. Nothing, it seemed, got her quite as turned on as being entirely under someone else's thumb.<br>
<br>
Hoblitzel cleared his throat. He looked down at his smartphone, and then up, confusedly, at Thirteen.<br>
<br>
"This says it's your last day here at the Plaza?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Thirteen answered. No eye contact.<br>
<br>
Hoblitzel hesitated, and then asked, "I thought you all signed two year contracts?"<br>
<br>
Two years was the standard length of a mailgirl's contract worldwide, not just at USF. The length of subsequent contracts, when a girl re-upped, tended to vary a bit more; but, even then, two years tended to be the accepted standard. Thirteen, however, was here at the USF Plaza for just three months.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Thirteen replied. "It's just me. I'm was only here for the summer."<br>
<br>
Hoblitzel looked confused.<br>
<br>
"I'm a graduate student at Yale, sir. Anthropology. I'm studying mailgirl culture for my thesis."<br>
<br>
"'Mailgirl culture,'" Hoblitzel repeated, as if he could not understand how Thirteen didn't realize how inane the idea was. He shook his head, stood, and came around to the other side of his desk. "Jesus. You don't even work here."<br>
<br>
She did, technically, work here – albeit as a mailgirl, for another ten-plus hours. But she understood what the executive in front of her meant, and she saw no upside in correcting him.<br>
<br>
"And I thought Amanda was stupid..." he amended, but allowed the thought to trail off.<br>
<br>
"Number Three, sir," Thirteen corrected him this time. She was required to.<br>
<br>
Hoblitzel just raised an eyebrow. He paused, looked down at the naked blonde kneeling alluringly on his floor, and then bumped his phone against the device on her arm. "Yes," he conceded, "Three."<br>
<br>
"Here," he said, turning back to the desk, and fished another piece of hard candy out of his bowl. "One more, as a thank you." He unwrapped another peppermint, and then – without asking permission, held it up to Thirteen's lips.<br>
<br>
Thirteen took the candy graciously, even as Hoblitzel's forefinger ever-so-gently welcomed itself into her mouth – touching her tongue, running absently over her lower lip, and then cupping her chin so that she was finally forced to make eye contact. She wasn't sure, exactly, what he wanted from her, so she met his eyes briefly, offered a submissive, "Thank you, sir," and then averted her gaze.<br>
<br>
His dismissed her, this time with more of a pinch of her than a pat. He closed his office door behind her, and the counter on Thirteen's smartphone buzzed to life.<br>
<br>
In another world and in another life, Thirteen might have needed a moment to collect herself, to cool herself down. The thought of servicing Hoblitzel with her mouth, or the thought of bending over and servicing him with her pussy, had been all she'd thought about over the last half hour. He was in the position of power. He was in control over her. And she was nothing more than a set of tits and ass. In another world and another life, she likely wouldn't have gotten so turned on in the first place.<br>
<br>
But Thirteen now had a delivery to make and a deadline to meet, and so her entire being was making that delivery; she had just thirty seconds to dash – walk swiftly, in this case – down the hallway to Mark Stansbury, the first of six recipients. As she passed Hoblitzel's assistant and the analysts seated in cubicles outside his office, she paid no attention to those who lifted their heads to watch her go by. She paid no attention to the leers, the whispered derision, or the catcalls.<br>
<br>
Hoblitzel had referred to the idea of mailgirl culture as "inane," something that could have easily been applied to very concept of mailgirls itself. Thirteen, when she'd first heard of the idea, had thought it was a joke. Companies tapped young, female employees, often in management track positions, to take on delivery duties for the duration of a two-year contract. These were girls with MBAs and JDs and other Masters degrees, girls who otherwise would have been groomed for department heads and strategy leaders. And yet they were approached to apply for positions ostensibly in the mail room. Even excluding Thirteen - who was still a year shy of completing her doctorate - USF's roster included a full PhD; Mailgirl Number Five was technically "Doctor" Five, and had been plucked from Quantitative Investments.<br>
<br>
And, of course, all of the girls were expected to deliver the mail naked.<br>
<br>
It made no sense. Even leaving pornographic and misogynistic fantasies aside, it made no sense. All of the girls at USF had been making good money even prior to becoming a mailgirl, and most of them had actually received a bump up in annual rate to take on mailgirl duties – albeit in the form of a few big lump sums that could be affected by how many demerits a girl racked up. USF, like other companies, even sweetened the pot for some of girls they selected – paying off student loans, buying out a girl's credit card debt, and so on. They guaranteed career advancement, in some cases, upon completion of the contract; Number Seven, for example, had been promised a fast track to Associate General Counsel. All to run memos from one corner of the USF Plaza to another, to deliver interoffice envelopes, to do something as mind-numbing and thankless as delivering the mail.<br>
<br>
But the mailgirls were not mailgirls simply because the company needed someone to deliver the mail. The original program, initiated in Tokyo within only the last ten years, had been a morale-boosting stunt. But it was a morale-boosting stunt that had gained surprising traction – first in Asia. Then in Europe. Then among gaming companies and dot.coms on the West Coast. And now, inconceivably just a few years prior, here in New York, among more conservative financial service firms like US Financial.<br>
<br>
As much of a stunt as the early mailgirl programs had been, it was the impact upon the bottom-line that titillated senior management even more. What companies found, time and again, was that mailgirls justified their lavish salaries and sign-ons dozens of times over. Sure, attrition overall spiked when a program was announced, especially among women; USF had been no different. But then, once things had normalized, attrition plummeted to levels unseen of before the mailgirl programs were rolled out. Among women, the decline was even more defined – it was one of those weird, unexpected, and paradoxical results that Thirteen was digging into from a research perspective.<br>
<br>
Similar impacts could be seen in a company's actual business. When a program was announced, there were clients who no longer wished to work with a company who'd treat any of their employees as the mailgirls were treated. Some of this came from a place of upright moral rectitude, but more often than not it was little more than PR. But as mailgirl programs became more and more common, they were less and less of a PR risk for a client. And, even in those cases where a client was truly and permanently lost, companies like USF more than made up for the lost revenue with new clients; client meetings had tripled at the Plaza over the last five months, as eager, prospective customers made excuses to see a mailgirl in action with their own eyes.<br>
<br>
Productivity gains, when quantified, were remarkable. Usage of vacation time and sick days was reduced. Leaves-of-absence were down, as was Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, and FMLA. And all of that was ancillary, less important than the true driver: confidence and superiority.<br>
<br>
It was a working theory that Thirteen still needed to better define and elaborate upon. But it held that the rank-and-file inside a company with mailgirls performed better, simply because they felt superior. By just about any quantifiable measure, the data proved her right – even USF had seen noticeable gains since just April, when the mailgirls program came online. Men performed better across the spectrum. Women, too, performed significantly better, with younger women – perhaps fearful of potentially being drafted into the mailgirl program itself – seeing exponential gains in quantitative performance. The qualitative data, though, suggested that young, attractive women were performing worse – but Thirteen discounted that finding as misleading, as it was often management's way to coerce a girl into taking a mailgirl position.<br>
<br>
And so, the fact that Thirteen was stark naked here in a place of business – save for a lycra armband and a dog collar – was secondary. It wasn't her nudity that helped make the program successful, but the humiliation she felt from that nudity. It was in her debasement and her suffering that she brought value. As she worked her way down the hall with her naked breasts ever-so-slightly bouncing through Asset Management, her very presence brought about a feeling of superiority in all she passed.<br>
<br>
Mark Stansbury's door was closed when Thirteen arrived. And, after risking a glance down at her armband to confirm she still had a few seconds to spare, Thirteen knocked gently.<br>
<br>
She was beckoned in, and any pretense of respect that Stansbury had for her as another human being was completely absent. He grunted an acknowledgement of her presence, and then raked her up and down with his eyes, taking in the full picture of the naked girl in front of him. Decent-sized C-cup breasts, nipples hard and at attention. Shaved pubic area, with her slit fully exposed. Long blonde hair, done up in childish pigtails. Slave collar. Armband. A touch of make-up and lipstick, but nothing more. And a number "13," prominently displayed on her hip in black marker.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had taken a step into Stansbury's office, but no further. Instead, she stood in "Feet" position – feet flat on the ground, legs parted, arms behind her back, chest pressed forward, and a vacant, submissive gaze directed at the floor. She waited for Stansbury's order to come closer, so that he could retrieve Hoblitzel's memo from her smartphone, and endured his examination patiently. She was little more than a piece of tits and ass to him; but then, it was her job to be little more than a piece of tits and ass to him.<br>
<br>
Thirteen was nowhere near as attracted to Stansbury as she was to Hoblitzel, but she suspected that was partly due to the power that Hoblitzel wielded. Stansbury was not unattractive; he was in his early forties, maybe even late thirties, well-dressed and well-groomed, just another one of a dime-a-dozen Wall Street types that worked here at USF. But, unlike Hoblitzel holding her for the better part of a half hour, this interaction with Stansbury was more routine.<br>
<br>
He called her closer. He tapped his smartphone against hers, waited for the memo to transfer, and then sent her on her way. No pat-on-the-ass, no derogatory comment, no hoops to jump through. Thirteen could only hope that all of her deliveries that day went so smoothly.<br>
<br>
From Stansbury, it was off to George Strunk. Then Mitch Miller. Debbie Truesdale. And so on. After Asset Management, it was an interoffice envelope from the 26th Floor to the 28th via the stairs. And then another, from the 28th to the 24th, again via the stairs. A standard mail delivery. Another interoffice. A series of memos back and forth between 23rd and 21st Floors. And so went the morning, dashing from one mail stop to the next, one associate to the next. It was routine, and in that routine, Thirteen allowed herself to operate on auto-pilot.<br>
<br>
She picked up two demerits for being just over a minute late on an interoffice delivery to a junior executive on the 30th Floor, and then another when she missed a deadline only by a few seconds. Risking a glance up at a clock down on the 16th, she confirmed that she still had a while before the girls would begin to be called back to the locker room in waves for their first break. At twenty-four demerits, and the bulk of the day still ahead of her, she knew that hitting number twenty-five and the punishment that followed was inevitable. But, she hoped against hope that she could avoid another until after her break; better that a spanking (or paddling, or whatever Mistress Zero was in the mood for today) eat into the thirty minutes she was allotted to at lunch than the fifteen minutes she had for break.<br>
<br>
It was up on the 33rd Floor that Thirteen had her first moment of rest, a rare lull in delivery activity that allowed her to catch her breath. She'd just delivered a memo to a manager in the Products & Segments division, and – without a notification pinging on her smartphone – made her way to the floor's reception desk, where she knew a mailgirl mat would be waiting for her. She passed the dour, uninterested receptionist, who didn't even bother to look up, and found Mailgirl Number Ten already there, on her knees.<br>
<br>
There was a single pink mat on the floor, pressed almost up against the wall to the right of the elevators, below a nondescript piece of corporate artwork and to one side of a silver dog bowl half-filled with water. It was no thicker than a traditional yoga mat, stamped with the official USF logo, and just big enough to accommodate two mailgirls in close proximity to one another. If two girls had already been kneeling there, Thirteen would have been forced to seek out another, similar resting spot on the 34th or 32nd Floors. But, thankfully, it was just Ten, and so Thirteen got to her knees beside the other girl as she scooted over.<br>
<br>
Knees on the ground, thighs parted, and sitting back on their haunches. They weren't allowed more than a quick moment or two of eye contact, but they smiled and greeted each other before bowing their heads. And, in their only deviation from the rigors of standard "Knees" position, Ten took Thirteen's left hand in her right, interlocking their fingers and holding hands. Though technically out of position, and theoretically risking a demerit from someone petty enough to assign one, holding hands was one of those rare transgressions that Mistress Zero and Human Capital seemed to look the other way on. All the mailgirls did it, whenever they found themselves paired up and resting on a mat together. It was a sign of camaraderie and commiseration, and took place even between two girls who might not have otherwise gotten along – such as the veiled, passive aggressive competition between One and Fourteen, or the falling out between Eleven and Eighteen when they stopped sleeping together.<br>
<br>
Thirteen, for her part, felt a mixture of awkwardness around and jealousy towards Number Ten. Whatever Thirteen's ever-so-brief relationship with Seven had been, and despite the fact that it had been Thirteen who'd wanted to keep her distance and her objectivity, it still stung a bit when Seven moved on to Ten so quickly afterwards. And to a combination of Ten and Nineteen after that.<br>
<br>
But Ten felt no such awkwardness around Thirteen, so far as Thirteen could tell. Her own relationship with Seven – if you could even call it that – was both casual and utilitarian. And the inclusion of Nineteen only seemed to underline the fact that it represented the "letter-carrying lesbian" phenomenon more than it did an out-and-out serious, monogamous lesbian pairing, like the one that Two and Three shared.<br>
<br>
"You're sweaty," Ten whispered. Not a "hi" or a "hello."<br>
<br>
Thirteen didn't apologize for it. "I just did 21 to 33 on the stairs, on a rush order, and got there six seconds under deadline."<br>
<br>
It was perhaps a weird thing to be proud of, but one that Ten, at least, appreciated.<br>
<br>
Ten was tall, slender, and blessed with long, well-toned legs that would have turned heads even if she'd been wearing clothes. Her breasts were on the smaller side - relatively, at least, as there were no flat-chested mailgirls. Thirteen guessed she might have been right on the line between a "B" and "C," and laughed to herself – not for the first time – how casually she now found herself evaluating other girls' chests. Ten had straight, shoulder-length brown hair that, at the moment, was spilling down freely on either side of her face. She was tanned, though not excessively so, and beautiful in a smart, East Coast sort of way.<br>
<br>
Ten was a few years older than Thirteen. Twenty-nine, Thirteen thought she remembered from the girl's file. She'd been at one of the big Swiss banks before getting her MBA, and had joined USF out of business school the previous summer. Her role with USF had been a strategic one, focused on client management and customer experience within Private Wealth Management, a role in which she'd caught the eye and the attention of a particularly deep-pocketed client. When USF first announced its mailgirls program, it was that client who'd first asked – of Ten's old boss – whether or not the young brunette was being considered. The promise of the mailgirl bonus, tuition reimbursement, and an eventual portfolio of wealthy clients all her own had been enough tempt her, and Ten had been a part of the May roll-out – only a few weeks before Thirteen arrived in New York.<br>
<br>
Her real name was Katherine. Or, at least, it had been, once upon a time - Thirteen thought of her only as Ten. Even the few girls who'd known each other prior to volunteering for the program referred to one another by their numbers now, both inside and outside the building. This was partly due to the fact that they were strictly forbidden from using each other's real names at work, and it was dangerous to get out of the habit while out for drinks or over the weekend for fear of slipping up while at the Plaza. But Thirteen suspected it was also partly due to an attempt at disassociating what they were forced to do as a mailgirl and who they really were: it wasn't Katherine who was forced to strip naked and parade through her old place of business, but rather Mailgirl Number Ten. Thirteen had taken a similar approach earlier in the summer, but she had to confess that the two versions of herself had begun to bleed together, and that her "true self" was more Mailgirl Number Thirteen that she felt comfortable with.<br>
<br>
"Getting a little salty," Ten giggled, using the term the mailgirls tossed around to refer to the particular combination of sweat, body odor, and pussy that they all succumbed to at various points in the day.<br>
<br>
"You've got no idea," Thirteen whispered back.<br>
<br>
"I've got some idea," Ten responded, squeezing Thirteen's hand in her own. "I got sent to the garage this morning."<br>
<br>
To the uninitiated, it sounded like a change in subject. Thirteen, however, knew what the other girl was driving at. They spent so much of their time at USF hurrying along among cubicles and offices, filing rooms and board rooms, and they'd all been naked day-in and day-out for so long, that it almost became easy to forget just how abnormal it was. It was embarrassing to be naked, sure, and Thirteen hadn't exactly stopped being embarrassed. But it was familiar. It was an embarrassment that she'd suffered countless times before and would suffer countless times again. Being sent somewhere new, on the other hand? Or, out of the ordinary? Suddenly, it was like being stripped naked again for the first time, being humiliated in an unfamiliar place in an unfamiliar way.<br>
<br>
It was also exciting.<br>
<br>
It was thrilling, in a naughty and exhibitionist sort of way. Ten had confessed to that dichotomy earlier in the summer, out for drinks at the Imperial. And Thirteen, for her part, had to agree. Being sent down into the shops on the first floor for one excuse of a reason or another, or out to the front desk to pick up a package that didn't go to the mail room first, or down the garage – it was a reminder at just how embarrassingly naked they were. But also a weird, deep-seated turn-on that nearly all of girls had owned up to.<br>
<br>
"Fucker got a personal delivery here in the office," Ten recounted, "and had me take it to his car for him. Big, heavy-ass box, and I needed two hands to carry it. Guess where I had to carry his keys?"<br>
<br>
Thirteen cringed and thought back to other mailgirl programs she had read about. No, not here. Not at USF.<br>
<br>
Ten took a hold of the D-ring on her own collar. "He just looped his whole key ring right here."<br>
<br>
Thirteen had to laugh a little.<br>
<br>
"No key fob, of course," Ten continued. "So picture me in the garage, bending down at the waist and mashing my face up against his Mercedes, so that I can unlock the driver's side with a key attached to my neck."<br>
<br>
"It's a sight."<br>
<br>
Ten paused, and then whispered, "But joke's on him. I wiped juice all over his leather seat."<br>
<br>
Thirteen laughed politely, but she wasn't exactly sure that the joke was on Ten's unnamed "fucker." Smearing a bit of pussy juice on the inside of some guy's car seemed like a minor victory, one that Thirteen was sure more than a few men would get off on. But Thirteen understood where Ten was coming from; it was one of those minor acts of retribution and defiance that a few of the girls – Fifteen, most often – seemed to need to get through this life. Thirteen, for her part, would never have been so bold, and even this seemed out-of-character for Ten.<br>
<br>
It went unsaid that, owing to her trip to the garage itself, Ten had apparently been wet enough to enact this particular brand of mischief. And it struck Thirteen that she probably hadn't had an opportunity to wash her hands between then and now.<br>
<br>
Thirteen gave the brunette's hand a squeeze.<br>
<br>
"You're coming tonight, right?" Thirteen asked.<br>
<br>
"Of course," Ten answered. "We've got send you off right."<br>
<br>
It sounded like all the girls, including the half that were scheduled to come in for their designated turn covering Saturdays, were planning to attend that night's "Bitch Sessions" at the Imperial. Even without a true cause for celebration, as Thirteen's impending release was for them all, Friday nights at the bar had become a weekly tradition, and an outlet for an otherwise beaten-down, beaten-up population of mailgirls.<br>
<br>
"The Atlantic Life girls are coming, too," Ten added. "I don't know about Mountbatten, though." Atlantic Life was a staid, conservative insurance company in Midtown, which had nonetheless followed USF's lead and rolled out their own mailgirls program in July. Mountbatten Asset Management, too, had begun a program, but theirs was only a few weeks old, and consisted of only six girls – only two of whom had shown up at USF's Bitch Sessions so far. Thirteen wasn't sure which of the girls at USF had reached out and invited them to the Imperial that first time, but she was appreciative of having other, local mailgirl initiatives to compare and contrast USF's against. And she was sure that the mailgirls from Atlantic Life and Mountbatten appreciated finding a larger pool of mailgirls with whom to share their pain.<br>
<br>
"Great," Thirteen replied, sincerely.<br>
<br>
"What are you wearing? Did you bring anything special?"<br>
<br>
Thirteen swallowed, and waited a moment as two fully-dressed young women passed by, glancing down at the two naked girls holding hands by elevator.<br>
<br>
"No, I just have my regular clothes," Thirteen said, once they'd walked away. By regular clothes, she meant the pencil skirt, blouse, and heels she'd worn the office that morning – vampish and tight-fitting all around – which she'd purchased that summer with money out of her stipend from her faculty advisor. But Thirteen found it difficult to talk about clothes when she was "in uniform."<br>
<br>
Ten, apparently, didn't feel quite as tortured; Thirteen suspected that planning out her outfit for that night was one of the rare slivers of hope that got her through the day. "Don't worry," Ten responded, "I've got an extra. I've got a cocktail dress in my locker that I think will fit you."<br>
<br>
Ten was a bit taller than Thirteen, but they had a similar build, and so Thirteen was fairly confident Ten's dress would fit. Unlike a few rare mailgirl programs that celebrated a wide spectrum of female body types, USF's was generally pretty limited: thin, above-average height, with breast size running between Ten's ample B's (C's?) to Six's stately-but-not-pornographic D's. And, unlike Thirteen's Spartan cubby back in the locker room, she knew that Ten's had a few outfits hanging in there at all times.<br>
<br>
"Absolutely," Thirteen offered with enthusiasm she didn't entirely feel; she felt comfortable in her own clothes, and wasn't entirely on-board with the idea of Ten playing dress-up with her like she were a paper doll. Nevermind the logistics of getting the dress back to the brunette, given that Thirteen was leaving for Connecticut in the morning.<br>
<br>
There was a familiar buzz, and both girls instinctively looked down at the smart phones on their arms.<br>
<br>
"It's me," Ten said, dropping Thirteen's hand and standing. She looked down at the smartphone again, and complained, "Ugh. 39." Six flights of stairs.<br>
<br>
As she turned to leave, she called back to Thirteen. "Maybe I'll see you on break. Or at lunch." Referring to the dress, "If we don't line up today, just take a look yourself."<br>
<br>
"Thank you," Thirteen answered. And, "Good luck!"<br>
<br>
Ten walked away quickly, to the stairs, and then began her ascent. As the stairwell door closed behind her, Thirteen felt that much more alone. As good as it was to hold hands with another mailgirl, to have a few moments of time together, Thirteen hated to admit that sometimes she preferred to be alone. On her own, she could have had her few minutes of rest, without having to converse, without having to think of herself as anything more than naked delivery girl.<br>
<br>
Thirteen's smartphone was still dormant. Either the delivery that Ten had been called away on had been one for which Ten had been requested specifically (which required the requestor to spend a few chits), or there were simply not that many active delivery requests at the moment. With twenty-four girls spread across forty-eight floors, and the cycle of morning breaks not yet begun, Thirteen suspected that it was the former, and wondered what sort of specific indignity awaited Ten on the 39th Floor.<br>
<br>
And so Thirteen decided to use the time to do something productive.<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Shean?" Thirteen asked politely. "May I have permission to use the bathroom?"<br>
<br>
The receptionist looked up from her computer and offered and audible sigh.<br>
<br>
Bathroom breaks were tricky. If at all possible, Thirteen preferred to empty her bladder in the mailgirls' locker room. Sure, there were six, industrial-looking toilets out in the open. Three of them faced the other three. And anyone in the elevator lobby on the far side of the locker room's mirror glass could watch, albeit with Mistress Zero's desk ever-so-slightly blocking a complete view. But bathroom breaks elsewhere in the building were an uncomfortable production, one that required a typically less than enthusiastic babysitter.<br>
<br>
Mailgirls were not allowed privacy. There were cameras in the stairwells, and cameras in the service elevators. USF's non-mailgirl population naturally would have balked at similar arrangements in the bathroom stalls, and Thirteen understood that USF had kicked around a handful of alternatives, each one more horrifying than the last. Should they install open toilets in certain designated areas for the mailgirls to use? Should mailgirls be limited to using the men's room, and only the urinals when at all possible? What about mop sinks in the janitors' closets? Someone had even suggested to Human Capital's Will Barrow the "litter box" approach, which he'd thankfully shot down.<br>
<br>
Instead, the agreed-upon method involved a chaperone. A mailgirl had to ask for, and be granted, permission from another USF employee. The employee, if granting the request, had to log the break on the mailgirl's smartphone (start time and end), and then follow the girl into the bathroom. Stall doors had to be left wide open, and the granting party had to stand outside and watch. It was humiliating for everyone involved. But, for Thirteen, who couldn't be sure if her break was coming as early as 9:30 or as late as 10:15, it was a necessary evil.<br>
<br>
There were no rules or regulations as to whether a mailgirl's chaperone had to be male or female, and there were a handful of girls – Fourteen among them, Twenty-One before the "incident" a few weeks prior – who preferred men. Yes, the mailgirl then had to use the men's room rather than the women's. But most men, no matter how poorly they might treat a mailgirl otherwise, tended to ignore the rule that required them to watch. Most stood just out-of-view, around the corner from the open stall door. There was still some decency that remained at USF.<br>
<br>
But Thirteen had found that asking a man was like playing Russian roulette. Sure, they'd grant that basic modicum of civility nine times out of ten. But every now and then, you'd stumble across that perverted creep that got off on watching a mailgirl pee. Just the thought of being leered at sexually as she emptied her bladder made Thirteen's skin crawl, and she could count on one hand how many times she'd made the request of a male coworker (acts of desperation, all) since just such an incident at occurred in late June.<br>
<br>
Women were more predictable. A younger girl? More attractive than average? Fearful of being drafted into the mailgirl program herself, that girl would dutifully keep her eyes on the mailgirl as she peed, hating every minute of it. There were some who made awkward small talk, and others who saw this as an opportunity to just open up and heap scorn upon naked mailgirl. But it was just another embarrassment to Thirteen, and her skin had grown thick. Preferable was an older woman, or an overweight woman, or an ugly woman. Without fear of being undressed and sent downstairs to join the mailgirls, most acted the same way that most men did. The stall door stayed open, sure. They might take a quick peek to ensure they were at least partially following the rules. But they generally stayed out-of-sight, and allowed a girl a few, brief seconds of privacy.<br>
<br>
And so, Mrs. Shean. She was in her late fifties, and still had a decent enough figure that she might have been at risk for a mailgirl program with a fetishist streak. She'd make a show of moaning and groaning about it, but she was a reliable chaperone when Thirteen was on the 33rd Floor.<br>
<br>
"One second," the receptionist replied.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Mrs. Shean."<br>
<br>
The proper form of address to all men was "sir," and "ma'am" to women. Never was a mailgirl to address an employee by their first name. But while "sir" carried with it little to no baggage, aside from submission on a girl's part, "ma'am" was a bit more loaded. There were older women, like Mrs. Shean, for whom "ma'am" wouldn't do, as it seemed to imply age. And, if she were being honest, addressing a twenty-one-year-old administrative as "ma'am" just felt awkward to twenty-six-year-old Mailgirl Number Thirteen. But "ma'am" was the default, unless instructed otherwise; it was up to the employee to tell the mailgirl to call them Mrs. So-and-So, or Ms. So-and-So, or even – shockingly common at USF since the program rolled out – the throwback of Miss So-and-So. Men could do the same, and so there were a handful of them throughout the building that Thirteen was allowed to call Mr. So-and-So.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Shean didn't rush. She continued typing, ignoring Thirteen's request for what felt like an eternity, though was probably no more than four or five minutes. As she waited, Thirteen prayed that her smartphone wouldn't buzz, that she wouldn't be called away before being allowed a bathroom break. Thankfully, it remained dormant until the older woman decided she'd made the mailgirl wait long enough, and made her way to Thirteen. She tapped in her employee ID on Thirteen's arm, and then led the way to the women's room down the hall.<br>
<br>
"Go ahead," Mrs. Shean instructed, and gestured to an open stall. She took up a position by the sinks, leaning against the counter, and waited.<br>
<br>
Thirteen didn't hesitate. She dutifully left the stall door open as she sat down, offering up a "Thank you, Mrs. Shean," as she did so. She was thanking the receptionist for the bathroom break itself, but there was also an implied gratitude that Mrs. Shean was around the corner and just out of sight.<br>
<br>
Thirteen wasn't the fastest mailgirl – that honor probably belonged to Sixteen or Four. But she wasn't the slowest, either. She admittedly picked up a few more demerits than average, but it was Twelve who seemed to be subjected to a punishment on an almost daily basis (to the point that some of the other girls had begun to speculate she enjoyed it more than the rest). She wasn't a "star," like One or Fourteen, both of whom had decided to embrace what it meant to be a mailgirl more than others. No, Thirteen was a middle-of-the-road performer, but a middle-of-the-road performer who'd been cursed with a small bladder.<br>
<br>
She'd suffered two accidents, both earlier in the summer, both of which still embarrassed her more than just about any other humiliation she'd suffered at USF. The first, in the actual mailroom, had been her own fault, that first week as a mailgirl. She'd simply been too embarrassed to ask, and had convinced herself that she could make it to her next break. That had been a small one, as she'd bolted to the bathroom without permission as it began to happen; she was paddled by Mistress Zero until her ass glowed. The second accident, two weeks later, had taken place more publicly, in Investment Financing, and was the result of a particularly bitchy administrative assistant who refused to grant Thirteen permission. She knew she was in trouble as soon as she'd taken her place on the mat, as she hadn't entirely learned to regulate her water intake at that point. She lost control, to the disgust and contempt of everyone in the area, and to this day hated having to go to Investment Financing more than just about any other department in the building. Custodial had been called, but it was Thirteen who had to clean up her own mess, and then carry the soiled mat down to the locker room and report the incident to Mistress Zero. She'd been paddled again, of course. But, as she apparently hadn't learned her lesson the first time, she'd also suffered her first overnight in the locker room – gagged, blindfolded, handcuffed, and leashed to her locker at the end of Evening Shift, and then left to sleep on the hard, tiled floor until Mistress Zero arrived the next morning.<br>
<br>
About half the girls had had an accident at least once, usually in the first week or two. Only Thirteen and Nine had suffered the indignity twice. And while that wasn't Thirteen's last overnight stay in the locker room, it was her last overnight stay for that particular offense; Thirteen hadn't had an accident since.<br>
<br>
Finished, Thirteen joined Mrs. Shean at the sinks and washed her hands. The receptionist then dutifully punched her employee ID into Thirteen's smartphone once more, logging that the bathroom break was over, and led the naked girl back to her desk.<br>
<br>
Bladder empty and her morning break pending, Thirteen stopped for a drink before returning to her station. She got down on all fours at the silver dog bowl, and then dipped her face down to the water. As the bowl was full enough, she sipped with her lips, but she wasn't above lapping up water with her tongue when the water level got low.<br>
<br>
"I will never get tired of looking at that!" Thirteen heard from behind her, and she knew that she and Mrs. Shean were no longer along in the reception area.<br>
<br>
She was fully aware of how exposed she was. Her head was down, her ass was in the air, and her sex on display like a female animal presenting.<br>
<br>
Thirteen swallowed, and then turned her head. She dared not look up and meet their eyes, but confirmed that there were three men now behind her. And, while she doubted that she was being addressed directly, she offered a "Thank you, sir," nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Indeed, as she returned to her mat, it was clear that the three men – all about her age – were talking to one another, about her, as if she couldn't hear them. One of them had pressed the down button for the elevator, and they continued to talk as they waited for their car.<br>
<br>
"Look at those lips," one of them offered. And, though Thirteen couldn't be sure which set of lips he was talking about, she suspected they'd moved on to her mouth. "Those are lips tailor-made for providing relief."<br>
<br>
They all laughed. "Providing relief" was mailgirl program code for a blowjob, though thankfully the practice hadn't spread to USF. Thirteen had chosen to do her research at USF specifically because the company had drawn a line in the sand of just how far they were willing to go, and "relief" was off the table, as were insertions and touching of almost every kind. Her faculty advisor, Gillian Schang, had known Human Capital's Will Barrow back as an undergraduate, and felt that with Will in charge USF wouldn't tolerate some of the over-the-line abuse that plagued any number of mailgirl programs elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Which wasn't to say that abuse didn't happen; after all, that was what the mailgirl program was all about.<br>
<br>
One of the other men glanced over his shoulder, to check if Mrs. Shean was paying them any attention. She wasn't. He ever so slowly and quietly unzipped his fly, and whispered, "Hey, Tits. Open up."<br>
<br>
Thirteen steeled herself. He wasn't going to do it. Of course he wasn't going to do it. At least, not here, not now. And so, calling his bluff, she met his eyes, opened her mouth, and dared him to follow through.<br>
<br>
"Do it," laughed another of the three men, urging him on.<br>
<br>
Thirteen could have protested, could have called Mrs. Shean's attention, and could have told them she'd report them for harassing her this way. But it wasn't worth it. She could handle this, this childish level of bullying, without sounding an alarm. It was nowhere near the abuse she suffered at the hands of Mistress Zero, and it wasn't so objectionable that she needed to make three new enemies.<br>
<br>
But before the game of chicken could go any further, the first man grabbed her roughly by the chin, and asked, "Aren't you supposed to correct him? For not using your number?"<br>
<br>
The whole thing was supposed to feel menacing, and Thirteen was supposed to feel victimized. She was naked, on her knees, and surrounded on all side by fully-dressed young men. She smiled, however, knowing full well that she'd called them out. She might have even been willing to take him into her mouth, as she'd been willing to do to Hoblitzel, confident that the repercussions to her – while painful – would be nowhere near as severe as they'd be to the three of them. To the one with her chin in his hand, she said, "Yes, sir." To the one whose fly was open, she corrected, "Thirteen, sir."<br>
<br>
"Thirteen," he laughed, starting to get uncomfortable. "Open up."<br>
<br>
But though Thirteen parted her lips and opened her mouth, the offending member never came.<br>
<br>
"Gentlemen?" Mrs. Shean called over. It wasn't a question. It was an admonishment.<br>
<br>
These three young men probably earned more in a week than Mrs. Shean did in a year, but she still held some power over them, as if she were scolding them like their mothers might have. They looked over at her sheepishly, and apologetically. And then the whole confrontation ended abruptly, when the elevator chimed and the doors slid open.<br>
<br>
When they were gone, and Thirteen was again alone with the receptionist, Mrs. Shean shook her head and wondered aloud, "I don't know how HR expects them to get anything done with you girls strutting around with all your goods on display."<br>
<br>
Thirteen knelt silently.<br>
<br>
The older woman looked over at her now, directly, and seemed to be sizing her up. Not physically, as Thirteen was used to, but deeper. Psychologically. Puzzling through the naked mailgirl's inner workings, figuring out just what made her tick.<br>
<br>
"You get off on this, don't you?"<br>
<br>
Thirteen hesitated. Three months ago, when she first started at USF, she might have issued a denial. Now?<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mrs. Shean."<br>
<br>
"That's what I thought," she responded. She went back to her typing, but not before amending, "Who knows? Maybe if I was in your position..." She trailed off.<br>
<br>
From the 33rd Floor, Thirteen was called down to the 31st. Interoffice. Then up to the 34th. Another interoffice. Then back down to the 33rd for a memo. Standard mail pick-up at the reception desk on the 28th, and then out and about amongst the cubicles on that floor. And so the morning sped on, with Thirteen running, jogging, speed-walking through the building, as the timer on her smartphone dictated her pace. And, though she wasn't called down for her break until as late as possible – 10:15 to 10:30 – Thirteen still managed to avoid another demerit. A punishment was coming, sure; likely at lunch. But at least for this morning, those fifteen minutes were all hers, to do as she pleased.<br>
<br>
Never wanting to pull too many girls off-duty at one time, Human Capital had staggered the mailgirls' breaks. The first of the morning breaks was scheduled from 9:30 to 9:45, and consisted of a random assortment of six girls, based on current activity level. From the tablet at her desk, and thanks to the geo-locators inside each of their smartphones, Mistress Zero could see exactly where all twenty-four girls were at any given time. She could see who was engaged in an active delivery, who was being "held" and expecting a delivery, who was on a bathroom break, who was currently at rest and waiting for her next assignment. She took them off duty six at a time, with their fifteen minute breaks beginning the moment they were notified by a chime from their smartphones on the band on their arms. Afternoon breaks were similar, at fifteen minute intervals between 3:30 and 4:30. Lunches, too, though they were allotted thirty minutes at lunch, and were split twelve and twelve between First Lunch at twelve-thirty and Second Lunch at one o'clock.<br>
<br>
Because breaks included the time it took for a mailgirl to get back to the locker room, time itself was precious, and it could be tortuous to see the countdown begin if a girl were on one of the upper floors. That was what Thirteen was dealing with now, watching her smartphone tick down from 14:50 to 14:49, as she waited for the service elevator on the 42nd floor.<br>
<br>
Unlike a number of companies that Thirteen had studied on the West Coast, with their suburban campuses and office parks, US Financial Plaza posed a challenge to a commonly enforced prohibition against mailgirls riding in elevators. Most programs had some allowances for service elevators when a delivery was big enough or heavy enough, and the employee sending the delivery granted permission. A forty-eight story skyscraper in downtown Manhattan, however, made such restrictions difficult to put into practice, as the ascent from the locker room on the 2nd Floor to the Executive Offices on the 47th or 48th might well have killed a girl. Let alone the time it would take to make the run.<br>
<br>
Instead, USF had followed the lead of a handful of other programs in Tokyo and Frankfurt, and allowed the use of service elevators when necessary. What Human Capital had decided to call "necessary," however, was an ascent or descent of more than ten stories. If Thirteen needed to get from the mail room on B2 to the 18th Floor, she was allowed to use the elevator. If she needed to get from B2 to the 6th, it was the stairs.<br>
<br>
Because of the tracking and analytics that Human Capital had its fingertips, because the closest mailgirl was the one who was called (unless an executive was willing to spend a few chits to call a specific girl), and because they'd continued to refine and find efficiencies the longer the program was active, the bulk of Thirteen's deliveries were usually within ten floors and required the stairs. Standard mail and packages from the actual mail room in the basement were an exception, but a high percentage of those were taken care of early in the morning, between seven and eight, before most employees arrived for the day. A significant portion of Thirteen's daily activity was interoffice and memos, and a significant portion of those were between and within departments clustered together in the building. Which wasn't to say that use of the elevators was rare; Thirteen was on and off the service elevators all day. It was just that, nine times out of ten, she was taking the stairs.<br>
<br>
The elevators, though, brought with them their own challenges. There were only four service elevators, compared to the plethora of regular elevators that the regular employees rode. And the mailgirls shared them with each other, as well as Maintenance, Custodial, and other members of the building staff. A mailgirl might pull out her hair waiting for a car to arrive, all while the timer on her smartphone ticked closer and closer to a deadline. Delivery times, thanks to the analysts in Human Capital, accounted for average service elevator wait times - but average was just that, and Thirteen had missed more than a few deadlines because her chariot was slow to arrive.<br>
<br>
Thus, the "greater than ten floors" allowance had, in practice, mutated into thirteen, fourteen, or even sixteen floors, depending on the mailgirl herself. Climbing the stairs, even at the risk of missing a deadline, meant that a girl had at least some control over her own fate; better to make a valiant effort and fail than fail because an elevator took too long to arrive. For Thirteen, fourteen floors was about her limit for an ascent, and even then she'd at least press the elevator button and then gauge how fast she thought it might arrive. For a descent, she might decide to take the stairs for as many as sixteen or seventeen floors; again, though, she'd try the elevator button first before gritting her teeth and betting on herself, betting that she could get there faster via the stairwell.<br>
<br>
The upside was that Thirteen was now in better shape than she'd ever been. All of the girls had been thin and athletic before signing on, but a few months of a mailgirl's routine had erased any excess pounds and left them all well-toned, well-sculpted, sights to behold. There were some deliveries that required little more than a fast-paced walk, but Thirteen generally spent most of her day at a light jog, with full-out sprints required at fairly regular intervals. She'd never been much of an exercise freak in New Haven or at Pepperdine, but she now found herself going stir-crazy on Saturdays and Sundays if she didn't get in at least one, ridiculously long run per day. And, because she'd gotten so accustomed to making such runs while barefoot, that meant a long, sneaker-less session in her building's basement gym.<br>
<br>
The elevator finally, thankfully, arrived, and Thirteen immediately reached for the button to hurry along the closing doors. She pressed the button for the 2nd Floor, and then prayed there'd be no stops on her way down.<br>
<br>
As she stood, fixated on the descent from 41 to 40, from 40 to 39, from 39 to 38, Thirteen ever-so-slightly parted her legs, and used her right middle finger to begin gently teasing her clit. Masturbation was strictly, strictly forbidden anywhere outside of the locker room, but Thirteen knew what she could get away with and what she couldn't. Mistress Zero could punish her for doing even this, of course, as punishments could be as trumped up and arbitrary as her mood varied. But though there were cameras watching Thirteen even now, touching herself in the service elevator was relatively private, and out-of-sight from the regular, non-mailgirl employees for whom USF was still a place of real work.<br>
<br>
Given the limited time her break in the locker room allowed, Thirteen was priming herself in the elevator, despite the fact that she was already dripping wet, and likely required only a quick minute or two to hit her first climax. If she had allowed herself, she was sure that she could find her orgasm even before the elevator reached the second floor.<br>
<br>
It didn't help that she could smell her own scent as well as she could in the confined space; no amount of cheap, mailgirl-issue perfume could mask the musky odor of Thirteen's own pussy. The very smell of arousal only served as a feedback loop. And the fact that it wasn't just her own smell sent a current of excitement running up and down her spine. There was a time that Thirteen might have thought that smell of pussy was the smell of pussy, but she'd become a bit of a connoisseur over the course of the summer, and she knew – almost instinctively – that Seven had been on this particular elevator at some point in the last few minutes.<br>
<br>
Thirteen groaned – not out of pleasure, but out of frustration and desperation – as the elevator slowed to a stop on the 21st Floor. She dutifully took a step back, into the rear, left side of the car, and parted her legs that much further, to make sure they were shoulder-width apart. And, excruciatingly, she removed her right hand from her pussy, and clutched her left behind her back.<br>
<br>
As the doors slid open, Thirteen was joined by one of the building's many custodians. She knew the smell of sex was obvious, even to someone without as fine a palate as her own. But Thirteen doubted any of the janitors or building maintenance staff minded all that much; Thirteen suspected that it was less of a problem and more of a perk. What was more, Thirteen knew that her arousal was the least she needed to be embarrassed about. A quick glance at the older, Eastern European gentleman confirmed that this particular custodian was the very one who'd shown up on that fateful day in Investment Financing, the one who'd handed Thirteen a mop to clean her own mess.<br>
<br>
She blushed, all over. Thirteen's embarrassment only emboldened her excitement. Not so much the activity in Investment Financing itself (though, some), but rather the punishment that followed. She couldn't help it – being left overnight, with the blindfold, with the gag, with the handcuffs, turned her on.<br>
<br>
The girls' Friday night Bitch Sessions at the Imperial were for blowing off steam, sure, but they'd also become one part support group and one part confessional. And, inevitably, at least a portion of every night out, week in and week out, was a game of one-upsmanship around what screwed-up thing they had discovered turned them on that week. For a random cross-section of America, maybe folks might have confessed to being into feet, or leather, or fat girls, or bondage. Mailgirl confessions could be just as wide-ranging, but typically boiled down to some combination of exhibitionism, humiliation, submission, and punishment. A girl might cop to an inadvertent orgasm during a spanking, or to just how turned on they'd become while making a delivery to their old floor, or at their secret arousal being ogled while trying to get a signature.<br>
<br>
The confessions were met with hoots and hollers, with laughs and screams. But the power behind them was that they were all experiencing the same thing, that this wasn't a kink or fetish specific to one girl. Maybe this was due to the fact that USF had researched its volunteers, and approached only those exhibiting certain traits or psychological make-ups (they hadn't; Thirteen had checked). Or maybe they'd tapped into something more universal, something deep-seated but denied, something that had lain in wait within their collective unconscious. Most of the girls believed the former - that they themselves were damaged and screwed up, and that USF had somehow targeted them specifically. But, faced with confessions and interviews of mailgirls worldwide, Thirteen was firmly in the other camp; she suspected that anyone in this position might have struggled with the same unexpected sources of arousal.<br>
<br>
Whether this arousal was unique to these twenty-four girls, or whether it was something more universal, the very fact that it was "normal" (or, at least, "normal" for this group) brought with it a certain freedom. Yes, Thirteen was ashamed that shame itself seemed to turn her on, but she could cop to it, own it, and act on it, because she knew that Seven was feeling the same way, and Twelve, and Fourteen, and Fifteen, and so on.<br>
<br>
Lost her own thoughts, Thirteen almost didn't get out of the elevator when it chimed its arrival on the 2nd Floor; her janitor was continuing his descent to B4. But, once awoken, Thirteen leapt to life, knowing that she was once more racing against the clock.<br>
<br>
She stepped into the elevator lobby, and then hurried through the gauntlet of toilets lining the hall into the locker room. She barely grunted an acknowledgement to either Four or Twenty-Three as she sped past them, but neither girl would take offense. Not only did they entirely understand, but they were otherwise engaged. Both were down on their hands and knees at a communal dog bowl at Mistress Zero's desk, sharing a quick morning snack.<br>
<br>
Fourteen was waiting for Thirteen at their adjoining lockers, and Thirteen hesitated momentarily, ticking through a handful of alternatives – the showers, the sinks, the locker of another girl. But the very fact that the brunette was already on her back, with her legs spread and her hand between them, was a temptation in and off itself. Not only did it mean that Thirteen wouldn't be alone, that she'd be just another masturbating mailgirl to the croissant-and-coffee crowd on the far side of the mirror glass, but – God help her – the idea of getting off next to Fourteen made it that much hotter.<br>
<br>
She glanced down at her leash, and was tempted to clip herself in, as Fourteen had done. But time was limited. Any chance she'd have to do something on her break other than get herself off, once she was done, would be at the mercy of Mistress Zero unlocking her. It wasn't a requirement, at least not until her break was over, but – again, God help her! – she'd learned from previous experience that it heightened the whole thing. And was a turn on, as evidenced by Fourteen, that she shared with others.<br>
<br>
She rolled to the floor in front of her locker, beside her masturbating coworker. Her whole body was wet and warm, and she felt sticky with sweat. The cool, tiled floor of the locker room provided welcome relief, but the girl next to her was kicking off body heat of her own. Fourteen had her head up towards and almost in her locker, her legs splayed towards the sinks and the audience beyond. Thirteen, in contrast, chose to face the other direction; she like to put her bare feet up, resting them low against the walls of her open locker. And, with no further delay, no need for any sort of foreplay, no need to ever-so-slightly tease herself as she had in the elevator, Thirteen's right hand found her pussy.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had never been an overly sexual person. She'd had her fair share of boyfriends. Though, maybe "fair share" was misleading, as she'd slept with a grand total of four men before that summer, and lost her virginity well into college. She was no virgin, though, and had even been in a mildly scandalous relationship with an Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department as late as that spring; she'd broken up with Christopher just prior to agreeing to spend her summer with USF, and had never shared with him the excruciating decision she had been forced to make. Everything with Christopher, with Brad, with Luke, with Mark, had been ordinary and run-of-the-mill. There was no role-play. There were no whips or handcuffs. There were no exhibitionist runs through a public park or late night in a hotel. There were no threesomes or lesbian leanings. Doggy-style, though still very much a turn-on, was as wild as Thirteen had got prior to becoming a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
It was sex. It was fine sex. It was acceptable sex. After she'd first slept with Mark, it was probably the better part of two months before she finally had an orgasm. Even then, it was due to oral. Her subsequent partners had been slightly more skilled lovers than Mark, and Thirteen herself had grown more confident in pursuing her own orgasm, so things had gotten better, and she'd been able to climax almost a third of the time with Christopher.<br>
<br>
Masturbation was obviously more successful, but Thirteen had masturbated infrequently. She'd go through a brief phase where she'd get herself off two or three nights in a row, but then it might be another three or four weeks before she did so again. She hadn't owned toys or vibrators. She hadn't watched a lot of pornography. She hadn't had intricate and detailed fantasies.<br>
<br>
Back in the locker room, Thirteen ran her right middle finger between her waiting pussy lips, back to front. At this point, she was no longer surprised at how wet she got after a morning on-duty. Her finger plunged deep inside her, finding no resistance to speak of. And, with the palm of her hand, she began grinding against her clit.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the distance, she heard Mailgirl Number Eight yip in that unique combination of pleasure and pain, and she knew that Eight had earned enough demerits to necessitate a visit to spanking bench. Beside her, Fourteen moaned softly; she was a bit of an actress, but as the mirror glass was nearly soundproof, Thirteen knew that this was either sincere or for Thirteen's benefit, and probably a bit of both. But Fourteen, Eight, Twenty-Three, Four, and whoever the sixth girl on break happened to be – none of that mattered at the moment. The only thing that mattered was Thirteen's own pussy.<br>
<br>
No, Thirteen had never been a particularly sexual person prior to becoming a mailgirl. But she'd never cum like she'd cum that night in June, after her first day at USF. She'd cried after, and that first night had been the hardest night of the entire summer. But she'd hit her first climax and just kept going – two, then three, then four. She had thought about being stripped in Will Barrow's office. She had thought about shadowing Number Seven on deliveries. She had thought about showering in the locker room, very aware that she had an audience on the other side of the glass. She had thought about catching One masturbating at the sink. And she'd exploded in wave after wave of pleasure, losing herself to the thrill and shame and excitement and embarrassment of the day.<br>
<br>
With her left hand, Thirteen ran her palm over her sweaty forehead, and then up into her hair. Her fingers found traction in the tight, blonde hair. She pulled one pigtail loose, knowing full well that she'd have to do her hair up again before she went back on duty, but liked the sensation of maintaining a firm grip on her locks. With her right, Thirteen lost another finger deep inside of her, her ring finger joining her middle inside of her soaking, sopping pussy. With her palm, she continued to grind – back and forth, up and down, in forceful, circular motions.<br>
<br>
Masturbation was tolerated at USF, but there was no general, accepted consensus when it came to programs elsewhere. There were some (and USF had almost, apparently, been among them) who banned it outright, believing that it was a crude step too far. And there were others for whom any allowance to the mailgirls was unthinkable. Thirteen had read of programs where a girl was only allowed to touch herself with permission from her supervisor or another non-mailgirl employee, and others that allowed a mailgirl to touch herself, but not orgasm, without that same permission. There were still others for whom masturbation was like a trick to be performed upon command, and more than a few more whose mailgirls were indistinguishable from full-on sex slaves and were expected to derive their pleasure from their work alone.<br>
<br>
What Thirteen had found was that programs who banned the practice altogether did so with marginal success. More successful programs accepted that allowances had to be made, that mailgirls would otherwise sneak off and do so anyways – punishments and consequences be damned. They simply couldn't help themselves. And so the program at USF had strict rules that forbade the girls from masturbating while on duty, or from doing so anywhere but the mailgirls locker room. Even on break, it had to be reported to and logged by Mistress Zero, which meant that anyone who bothered to pull up the mailgirls app could count just how many times Thirteen had gotten herself off at the Plaza that week.<br>
<br>
But it was an allowance nonetheless, one in which most of the girls partook. Only a handful – Twenty-Four, Eight, and Five – had the willpower to resist, and both Twenty-Four and Eight had confessed to Thirteen that still did so, excessively, on their own time. Crowds, apparently, had begun to gather in the elevator lobby from 9:30 to 10:30, from 12:30 to 1:30, from 3:30 to 4:30, and at the end of the day, to gawk at the naked girls and watch them finger themselves into ecstasy.<br>
<br>
The program at USF, when it first launched in April, followed a similar trajectory as Thirteen had read about elsewhere. Among the initial class, there'd be hesitance and denial, girls insisting they wouldn't give into their baser impulses and willfully join in and play a part in their own public shame. They had self-control, after all. And, despite the fact that they were stripped naked and forced to parade around their former colleagues in the buff, none was eager to give in or give up, none was willing to show how much their new life was turning them on. But at USF, like other programs, someone finally broke; it had been One, just four days in, who'd first gotten herself off in the showers after a long, hard day.<br>
<br>
Never, in the history of the programs that Thirteen had researched, did a mailgirl stop after just one time. Once the initial taboo was broken, there didn't seem to be as much of a hurdle stopping a girl for going back a second, third, or fourth time. One had touched herself again the very next day, again in the showers, again after another long, hard day. She had been met with derision and scorn from most of her fellow mailgirls, as the first girl to masturbate often was. The original Mailgirl Number Four had been one of One's harshest critics, but she'd abandoned her job over the following weekend. By Monday morning there was a brand new Number Four and less resistance in the locker room.<br>
<br>
Three was the next mailgirl to break, and then Two and Six shortly thereafter. The new Number Four followed. Amongst that first cohort, all five of the "participating" girls wrestled with what they were doing, and had periods of restraint and self-discipline that typically lasted no more than a few days. As new mailgirls joined, it became an accepted behavior and a part of the girls' overall culture here at the Plaza. More than that, it became expected of them, and even Thirteen had to confess she felt annoyed at Five, at Eight, at Twenty-Four; the very fact that those girls weren't touching themselves regularly reflected poorly on the rest of them. But now that Twenty-Four was single, Fifteen and Fourteen were taking bets on when she'd finally succumb; Thirteen was surprised that Twenty-Four had made it through the week, but was extremely skeptical she'd last through next.<br>
<br>
The May class knew what the April class was doing, prior to the May class joining the program. And so it took less time for the first girl of the next group to break; Nine had masturbated on her very first day. Thirteen, for her part, had come into the program with eyes wide open, knowing full well that she'd likely join in – if for no other reason than to truly and completely experience life as a mailgirl. She'd even made the decision ahead of time that she'd wait until her second week, so as to "adjust" to the other humiliations that her advisor Gillian was asking of her, and to keep from coming off too slutty. But what Thirteen hadn't counted on, and what other girls who insisted "never me" didn't expect, was just how sexually intoxicating the life of a mailgirl really was. Being no more than a piece of meat, a set of tits and ass, a sexual object, left a mailgirl feeling sexual.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had given in on day number two.<br>
<br>
The night before, she had cum like she'd never cum in her entire life. But even that didn't touch the first time Thirteen had done so at USF. It left her feeling red-faced and embarrassed, sure, but she was one girl among many. And the truth of it was that she'd never felt so weak-in-the-knees and satisfied before. Satisfaction, though, turned out to be short-lived, and touching herself at work quickly became both a part of Thirteen's regular routine and so, so, so very necessary.<br>
<br>
It had been just barely over a minute on the floor in front of her locker, and Thirteen could already feel her first orgasm coming on. She'd been on edge and excited all morning, from stripping and being inspected, from waiting on the floor in Hoblitzel's office to making her rounds, from holding hands with Ten to riding the elevator with the janitor. None of the specific scenes, alone, lingered in her fantasies for long. Rather, it was the combined weight of the entire morning that had her as hot as she was, and it was the realization that she still had three-quarters of the day to go that sent her cresting for the first time.<br>
<br>
Her whole body convulsed violently. Her toes curled. Her jaw clenched. And she bucked her hips into the air, meeting an imaginary lover. She used her left hand to brace herself against the tiled floor, but it wasn't enough to keep her entirely in place. Her bare right arm was now touching Fourteen's bare right thigh, and neither girl was capable of pulling away. Whether it was the sensation of skin against skin or the sound of Thirteen's orgasmic exhalations, Fourteen was now, too, in the throes over her own climax.<br>
<br>
For Thirteen, her first was always easy. But her second orgasm was always even easier, and bigger, provided that she never let up from her first. She still couldn't believe that she'd ever, ever stopped masturbating after a single orgasm; but, then, she'd never been as aroused in her prior life as she was now regularly aroused in her life as a mailgirl. Her middle and ring fingers were extracted from her depths, covered in pussy juice, and took the place of the butt of her palm against her clit. They moved rapidly, desperately, back and forth, working in a frenzy to chase her second climax. She knew she was touching, bumping, and rubbing up against Fourteen. But Fourteen was squealing to herself just loud enough to reverberate through their end of the locker room, lost in her own orgasm. And even if one or the other hadn't been lost in herself, neither likely would have objected.<br>
<br>
USF allowed the girls to masturbate, but they had drawn the line at out-and-out lesbian sex. The "letter-carrying lesbians" phenomenon among mailgirls was common everywhere, but it was forbidden here in the building. It seemed to be an arbitrary line-in-the-sand, but one that Thirteen felt kept her baser instincts from running away her; even now, she had to fight the urge from rolling over and grinding her crotch against Fourteen's naked body. The fact that they were touching, even, risked the ire of Mistress Zero, but they were probably on the right side of the regulation. Which was laughable, considering that the side-by-side masturbation Thirteen and Fourteen were engaged in now was arguably more intimate and honest than anything she'd ever experienced with Christopher.<br>
<br>
Thirteen gasped for air, and felt her second orgasm begin to overtake her. Her thighs clamped together around her hand, and her feet were back on the floor. Her left hand found the metal collar around her neck, and held on tightly. Her lips parted, her eyes closed, and she let loose a deep, low, guttural moan.<br>
<br>
Fourteen, meanwhile, had finished her whinnying and whining, and – with an eye out for Mistress Zero – had pulled away from the naked blonde beside her, if ever so slightly. Thirteen couldn't have been sure if that particular orgasm had been Fourteen's second or third, or if it had been a one-and-done, but there was no doubt it had been real, as the brunette worked to regain her breath. Fourteen, like One, seemed to understand better than most girls that what they were engaged in was a bit of a show, and committed to her role. Thirteen had watched the girl masturbate in the showers before; while there was no doubt that she'd been turned on, and while there was no doubt she was getting herself off, her performance was over-the-top in parts, more pornographic than true desperation.<br>
<br>
For Thirteen, it was true desperation through and through. Her second orgasm was every bit as powerful as she'd expected it to be, originating deep inside of her and shooting bolts of sexual energy coursing through her entire body.<br>
<br>
But two wasn't enough. And, though Thirteen was racing against the clock, and though she knew chasing number three would be marginally more difficult than hitting one and two, she could not help herself.<br>
<br>
There'd be no number four. Or, at least, not now. By the time that Thirteen crested a third time, she knew her fifteen minutes were nearly up. And, as her ass came back down to the floor, it struck her just how much she was sweating. Unlike Fourteen, who was still chained up beside her and dutifully doing her best to give Thirteen her privacy and space (but whose knowing smirk signaled otherwise), Thirteen wanted to get in a rinse before heading back into the building. Fourteen probably could have benefited from a quick shower herself, as she, too, smelled of sex; but she wasn't perspiring as much as the blonde next to her.<br>
<br>
Thirteen looked at the smartphone on her arm, and confirmed that she had less than two minutes to get into position back at her locker. She wasted no more time, shedding the lycra armband and the smartphone itself, and then walked briskly to the showers. There was no need to wait for the water to warm up; even if mailgirls had been allowed a creature comfort as negligible as warm water, Thirteen knew she'd benefit from a cold shower. She needed to cool herself down inside and out.<br>
<br>
In a perfect world, she would have left herself enough time for a trip to the toilets, as well. But Thirteen did not live in that perfect world – far from it – and so she squatted in the shower itself. It was a common enough practice among the mailgirls, one that Thirteen regularly employed on her morning breaks, so that she could maximize the amount of time she spent on her most pressing urge. It struck Thirteen, not for the first time, that only a panel of mirror glass separated her from the elevator lobby beyond, but she didn't linger on that thought – it was out of her control.<br>
<br>
Paradoxically, it was that very lack of control that Thirteen found so freeing. She was a mailgirl – of course she wore no clothes. She was a mailgirl – of course she would get herself off in the middle of the day. She was a mailgirl – of course she'd subject herself to inspections and spankings and whatever else Mistress Zero and Human Capital chose to throw at her. All of this was expected of her, and it was only in pushing back, in demanding some measure of dignity, that she called attention to herself. It was what Thirteen felt that Five didn't understand, what Eight struggled with, what Twenty-Four would only soon likely come to realize – things were easier if a mailgirl just bent with the wind, and accepted her place.<br>
<br>
Maybe it was easier for Thirteen, as she hadn't worked at USF prior to becoming a mailgirl and would be leaving the company and the people behind that afternoon. Maybe she was in no position to judge. But she saw just how miserable Five and Eight were, in particular, and couldn't help but believe that they, too, would find freedom in submission, just as the other girls had done.<br>
<br>
Freedom, and maybe something more. The summer had been eye-opening for Thirteen, and she'd shed any number of preconceptions about who she was when she'd shed her clothes. The girl she'd been three months ago seemed almost unfamiliar to her now – prudish and uptight, stressed out over longer-term deadlines and tuition bills. That girl had never, truly been looked at as a sexual object, and had never experienced just how surprisingly good it felt to be objectified, to be an object of lust. That girl had never cum like Thirteen had just cum now, had never had an orgasm that belonged in the same conversation as the orgasms she'd had that summer. That girl had never streaked through a public place, had never had a one night stand, had never had a girl-on-girl experience. That girl had never felt the us-against-the-world camaraderie she'd felt while holding Ten's hand in Products & Segments that morning, or the open and honest sharing she'd be a part of tonight at the Imperial. Thirteen wasn't looking to run out and volunteer to become a mailgirl somewhere else, and she felt plenty of sympathy for the girls who still had twenty-some more months to go. But with her summer now almost over, Thirteen could admit that at least part of her was happy she'd experienced life among the mailgirls.<br>
<br>
She rinsed her body, but was careful to avoid getting her hair wet. One of her pigtails was out, but she knew – if pressed for time – she could re-do it at her locker. Soap and water washed away the sweat and the sex, and even some of the grime from Thirteen's bare feet. It wasn't a full shower; she wouldn't take a long, complete, scrub-every-part shower again until the end of the day. But it was one of a number of periodic rinses throughout the day, to make sure that her "uniform" remained presentable.<br>
<br>
She toweled herself dry with one of the rough, white hand towels the girls were provided, rolled on a fresh coat of the girls' communal deodorant, and misted herself with conservative amount of perfume. And, even as she returned to her locker, she was already doing her hair. If she'd had more time, she might have checked her reflection, but time was a luxury that mailgirls rarely enjoyed. Thirteen was well-practiced at this, however, and knew she was in good shape as she took her place beside Fourteen at her locker. Down on her knees, thighs spread, arm band back in position, and now leashed to the floor, Thirteen was now ready for the rest of her morning.

<p>
Mailgirl Number Thirteen winced as she accepted another blow. The sound of the paddle connecting against the bare flesh of her behind echoed through the locker room, and carried over the murmured conversation of the other mailgirls behind her. She was standing, with her legs spread and bent at the midsection over the spanking bench, just to one side of the locker room's entrance. If she had looked up, she'd have been able to watch as her own reflection received the paddling in the mirror-glass. But, as she was painfully aware of the audience on the far side of that glass, she kept her eyes cast downwards and braced herself for Mistress Zero to connect again.<br>
<br>
She wasn't alone. The spanking bench, such as it was, had always reminded Thirteen of a pommel horse, and was large enough to accommodate two girls at a time. She might have been alone for most of her day, dashing from mailstop to mailstop in the buff among a sea of fully-clothed Wall Street types. But, here in the mailgirls locker room, she was rarely alone, and typically suffered her embarrassments and indignities in good company. And so she'd waited patiently, in position, as Mailgirl Number Twenty-One was paddled first, just as Twenty-One was waiting now for Thirteen's punishment to be complete.<br>
<br>
Not that Mistress Zero was today willing to let either girl wait without inflicting a new form of torture upon them. As early as that morning, Thirteen had suspected that her mistress, her dominatrix, had something waiting for her, something for Thirteen to remember her by. That something turned out to be a pair of weighted nipple clamps, a new hell that Mistress Zero was gifting to her mailgirls as a celebration of Thirteen's last day at USF Plaza. Each time another blow connected, Thirteen grimaced in pain - not so much at the paddling itself (after all, no matter how red Thirteen's bottom became, it was a pain she was used to), but at the tug and pull the clamps' momentum exerted upon her nipples.<br>
<br>
It could have been worse. It could always be worse. It was the motto of the mailgirl, the mantra that allowed Thirteen to accept a new form of torment without complaint. In the grand scheme of all she'd suffered that summer, a pair of nipple clamps and a paddling was a parting gift Thirteen would happily accept.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had thought, for sure, she'd be treated to the riding crop. She'd picked up her twenty-fifth demerit on one of her first few deliveries back from her morning break. And then another just before lunch. And she found herself wondering how Mistress Zero would make her pay for any demerits that earned that afternoon. The paddle had been a surprise, though; the girls were subjected to corporal punishment every time they racked up twenty-five demerits, but Mistress Zero had been granted latitude in how that punishment was delivered. She could spank a girl with her own bare hand, if she so chose - it was the least painful, and it was also the choice that Thirteen had to admit got her hottest. There was also the paddle - a long, cricket-bat-looking piece of wood that was one part fraternity basement and one part sex dungeon, and the instrument that Mistress Zero was currently applying to Thirteen's naked ass just now. Then there was the riding crop, which stung tremendously, left welts on a mailgirl's behind for the better part of a day or so, and would have made the ride tomorrow from New York to New Haven less than comfortable. And then, finally, there was the most sadistic - the whip that sat curled, ominously, in the bottom left-hand drawer of Mistress Zero's desk. She'd used it only once all summer, on Twenty-One, and the memory of the sound alone was capable of sending a shiver of fear up Thirteen's spine.<br>
<br>
The paddle hurt, sure. And Thirteen's ass would be red when she returned to duty after lunch. And, yes, she'd feel it if she found herself tempted to sit down tonight for Bitch Sessions at the Imperial. But the very fact that she'd be able to ride back to Connecticut without the painful and present memory of Mistress Zero seemed almost like a kindness.<br>
<br>
Almost, Thirteen thought to herself. The nipple clamps were a powerful counterargument.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the physical pain of the paddling that had Thirteen wet - she hadn't picked up that particular kink that summer, thankfully. And it wasn't the embarrassment and humiliation over the act that turned her on. Like so, so many other aspects in the life of a mailgirl, it was the very fact that she'd ceded power over to Mistress Zero that hit the sweet spot somewhere deep inside of Thirteen. She was entirely at the mercy of the tall German woman spanking her, and it was the submission itself that had Thirteen's pussy tingling.<br>
<br>
The memory of the whipping Twenty-One had received triggered the memory of what had come after. And if submission to Mistress Zero now had her wet, submission to Mistress Zero that particular weekend would haunt Thirteen's fantasies for years to come.<br>
<br>
It was Human Capital that had flagged the irregularities in Twenty-One's data set. The smartphones that the girls wore on their arms were equipped with geo-locators that allowed Mistress Zero and the analysts on the 18th Floor to track their every move in the building. And every delivery was logged, tracking a girl's actual delivery time versus the delivery time that Human Capital had expected, based on a massive amount of data that included that girl's typical speed, other girls' typical speeds, how many floors a girl needed to ascend, how long the average wait for the service elevators might be, and so on. The girls themselves tried to game the numbers some; it didn't pay to arrive too soon, as deadlines would only be made shorter the next time. And, of course, it certainly didn't pay to arrive late, as they'd pick up a single demerit for anything less than a minute past deadline, and then an exponentially increasing number of demerits after that.<br>
<br>
The smartphones also logged breaks and lunches, and bathroom breaks were required to be logged by an employee chaperoning a mailgirl's trip to the toilet. It wasn't uncommon for a mailgirl to ask a specific employee to babysit them in the bathroom on a regular basis. After all, the girls knew who was friendly and who wasn't, who'd treat them well and who'd treat them poorly, who'd grant them a modicum of privacy and who'd stare at them like a lech. And as much as they were here, there, and everywhere over the course of a day, they could be requested specifically by senior executives willing to spend a few chits to call Mailgirl Number Thirteen, or Mailgirl Number Twenty-One, and there was admittedly some opportunity for the mailgirl herself to volunteer to take standard mail up to a specific floor.<br>
<br>
It also wasn't uncommon for a mailgirl to ask a male employee to play the part of chaperone. Some girls preferred it, as most men were more willing to defy the mailgirl regulation that required a granting employee watch the girl actively as she peed. Thirteen wasn't among these girls, however, as the opportunity of drawing a pervert who enjoyed watching her simply wasn't worth the risk.<br>
<br>
But that first week in August, one of the analysts in Human Capital noticed an abnormally long pair of afternoon bathroom breaks in Twenty-One's data. They were both in IT, and they were both logged by the same male technician. When, on Friday, that very same technician in IT had logged the start of a bathroom break on Twenty-One's behalf, Human Capital received an alert, and they sent Mistress Zero to investigate.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had since heard directly from Twenty-One how Mistress Zero had found her. She was in the handicapped stall of the men's room on the 6th Floor, door dutifully left open, and accompanied by a chaperone - all per regulation. However, she was clutching one of the handrails, with her face pressed up against the wall, as her chaperone stood behind her with his pants around his ankles and his dick buried deep inside of her. She hadn't been able to stop, even when she'd been found out, and she managed a few more quick thrusts against the tech before Mistress Zero grabbed her by the hair and pulled her screaming from the men's room. A few seconds more, Twenty-One had later opined, and she might have been able to hit her climax.<br>
<br>
As arbitrary as it may have seemed, given the nude mailgirls parading through a place of work and masturbating on the second floor for all to see, USF had no tolerance for sexual relations between its employees and its mailgirls. It was what had drawn Thirteen and her advisor to USF in the first place, as Thirteen could conduct her anthropological research without fear of becoming of a full-on sex slave. The offending tech was fired on the spot, and his supervisor was terminated later that afternoon; per Human Capital, it was the supervisor's responsibility to supervise his employee. The following week, Employee Relations was called in, and three more techs were told to clean out their desks, as they had known what was happening but hadn't bothered to report it.<br>
<br>
As there was literally no offense for which a mailgirl could be fired, Twenty-One was introduced to the whip. And the other girls were forced to watch. A joyous Friday afternoon in which half of them were off the next day, and most of them were headed over to the Imperial for drinks and their weekly Bitch Session, quickly went off the rails. Every crack of the whip drove home that, no matter how horny and turned on a mailgirl might become, there was a line that USF was not willing to let them cross.<br>
<br>
It had been Twenty-One, as it turned out, who'd initiated congress with the technician, a rough-around-the-edges low level employee six years her junior. She'd lured him into the stall that first time, and suggested that he send a few interoffice envelopes over the next couple of days to bring her back. This confession irked Thirteen, as she herself had been called to the 6th Floor on one of the days, only to be greeted by a look of disappointment and what she now believed had been an empty interoffice envelope. The tech, certainly, hadn't resisted Twenty-One's advances, but the very fact that Twenty-One had been the aggressor left the rest of the girls breathing a sigh of relief; if had been the other way around, they all might have been concerned that the slide down the slippery slope had begun, and that any one of them could be next.<br>
<br>
Not that that relief provided much comfort when all twenty-four girls were punished for Twenty-One's sins. Twenty-One had been the only girl to be lashed, sure. But Thirteen doubted that the whip alone was enough to keep the girls from acting on their arousal; she herself had been horny enough on more than one occasion that she might have willingly accepted the punishment in exchange for the pleasure. To keep Twenty-One in-line, and to keep any of the other girls from ever repeating Twenty-One's mistake, Mistress Zero kept every single one of the girls at the Plaza that night.<br>
<br>
No drinks at the Imperial that particular Friday night. No Bitch Sessions. No weekend escape for the girls who'd suffered all week long.<br>
<br>
But Friday, as it turned out, wasn't the end of it. Mistress Zero utilized half of the girls for Morning Shift on Saturday, and the other half in the afternoon, disregarding whom she'd actually scheduled for the duty back on Thursday afternoon. When not on call, the other girls were left on their knees, at their lockers. As they'd spent the large part of Friday evening. As they'd spend a large part of Saturday evening. As they'd spend the entire day on Saturday. The whole weekend long, the USF mailgirls weren't allowed to go home.<br>
<br>
And, of course, there was more. They were blindfolded, gagged, and handcuffed. During daylight hours, they were expected to be on their knees at their lockers, leashed to the floor. Friday evening. Saturday morning. Saturday evening. All day Sunday. Thirteen knelt, and knelt, and knelt. Her knees and legs grew sore. Her shoulders ached, with her arms handcuffed behind her. Her jaw was on fire - propped open by the ball gag - and her mouth painfully dry. They were given brief breaks, to eat and use the facilities, but they were forced to take turns, and to do so alone. The first girl unlocked the second girl's leash and her handcuffs, and removed the blindfold and gag. The second girl was then expected to re-secure the first, hurry through her few minutes of relative freedom, and then move on to the third for the cycle to repeat itself. They weren't allowed to shower, they weren't allowed to talk, and - excruciatingly for most of them - they weren't allowed to touch themselves. Thirteen counted the cycles of breaks to pass the time.<br>
<br>
Thirteen knew from experience that a night curled up on the floor of the locker room, bound and secured, was not particularly conducive to sleep. But by Saturday night, she was so sore and exhausted that not even her frenzied, frantic arousal could keep her awake.<br>
<br>
By the time Monday morning arrived, Thirteen's only priority was getting herself off, a priority that she shared with the others; the scene that morning on the shower block was the stuff of legend. She looked forward to her deliveries in a way that she never had before. She masturbated more that day than she ever had before or since. And even when she was finally allowed to return to her apartment that night, she found that she never really left the locker room. It was odd to wear clothes after being naked for eighty-some hours straight. It felt foreign to actually sit down. Even her bed seemed wrong, and it had taken a move to the carpeted floor of her bedroom for her to finally fall asleep.<br>
<br>
"Thwack!" Thirteen received another blow from Mistress Zero, and she realized she'd lost count of just how many times she'd been paddled.<br>
<br>
Twenty-One suffered right alongside the other girls, but the girls were slow to forgive. Even now, three weeks later, there were a handful of girls who still wouldn't speak to her. It had taken Thirteen a couple of days; even if the weekend under Mistress Zero's lock and key had been a weird, twisted turn-on, and even if it continued to be so now, Thirteen had still lost her weekend. She'd lost the opportunity to go out for drinks with her friends. She'd lost the opportunity to pull together her research notes, as she typically did on Sunday, so that she could send them to Gillian. She'd lost the opportunity for her weekly call with her mother. The punishment was still a punishment, no matter how much it had turned her on, and Thirteen wasn't alone in being angry over receiving a punishment for something Twenty-One had done.<br>
<br>
That weekend had been the breaking point, it turned out, for the original Mailgirl Number Twenty-Three. Five weeks into her role as a mailgirl, Twenty-Three hadn't really stood out to Thirteen, and she'd taken her sufferings and humiliations right alongside the rest of them. But that morning, despite signing into her smartphone and beginning her day, something snapped inside of her, and she decided that she couldn't take being a mailgirl any more. Not even bothering to return to the locker room to collect her things, Twenty-Three went AWOL, walking right out the front door and into the streets beyond in nothing more than her armband and collar.<br>
<br>
Adding insult to injury - and even Thirteen had to laugh at this - when Twenty-Three was finally picked up by the NYPD, the police didn't take her home, or to their precinct. Instead, they brought her back to the Plaza. Not only had she walked out with USF property (her smartphone, the collar), but Twenty-Three was technically USF property herself; her contract said so, and Twenty-Three had reconfirmed that fact that very morning, as part of her routine affirmations. What followed were the typical threats and promises of retaliation, and Thirteen knew that Twenty-Three had done lasting, long-term damage to herself both financially and professionally. But a more formal resignation was finally accepted, and Twenty-Three was allowed to walk out of USF with her freedom, such as it was. She wasn't allowed to leave with anything else, however; she returned home in a police blanket, and her clothes were still hanging in her locker when the new Mailgirl Number Twenty-Three joined the team that afternoon.<br>
<br>
Thirteen grunted to herself as Mistress Zero landed another blow. That one stung more than the last.<br>
<br>
In the twisted mind of a mailgirl, Thirteen ultimately found herself more angry, upset, and annoyed with Twenty-Three than she had been with Twenty-One. Twenty-One's sin had landed on them all, but it was a sin that Thirteen understood. She'd been tempted herself, and it wasn't unthinkable that Thirteen might have succumbed to her own arousal that way at one point or another if she had remained a mailgirl long enough.<br>
<br>
But Twenty-Three? Screw her. They'd all suffered that weekend, and they'd all suffered the same. What made her think she was special? What made her incapable of accepting the punishment that the rest of them had? In her darker moments, Thirteen found herself rooting for USF to ruin her. If it were easy to get out of a mailgirl contract, they'd all have done so dozens and dozens of times over by that point. It wasn't fair that Twenty-Three was able to leave them all behind.<br>
<br>
Thirteen received one final kiss from Mistress Zero's paddle, and a part of her - knowing that it might just be her last ever - longed for more. "Thank you, Mistress," she dutifully acknowledged, before propping herself more upright against the spanking bench. She reached behind her and gently massaged her aching behind, the flesh hot and sore. But it wasn't her ass that was causing her the most distress, nor the clamps on her nipples. Without waiting, without bothering to move away, she found her pussy, and wasted no time in masturbating a second time that day.<br>
<br>
Twenty-One had decency enough to give her space, but her presence would have caused Thirteen no pause, if the other girl had decided to linger. Thirteen was probably on the receiving end of more punishments than the average mailgirl. And as much as she felt that Mistress Zero was singling her out, to put the PhD candidate in her place, Thirteen wondered if she were secretly sabotaging herself so that she could return to the bench. Because as much as a paddling might have hurt, there was no denying how excited the blonde girl was at being on the receiving end of Mistress Zero's domination.<br>
<br>
Legs spread and hands between her legs, with both her nipples and bottom shrieking out in pain, Thirteen stood at the spanking bench and got herself off. The first orgasm came quickly, and the second wasn't far behind, Thirteen gasping and sighing as she hit each climax. She longed to stay and pursue a third, or a fourth, but time - once again - was against her.<br>
<br>
Tonight, she assured herself. Tonight.<br>
<br>
She was still catching her breath when she caught up with her mistress, finding the German woman back at her desk and surveying the goings-on of the mailgirls' locker room. It was at half capacity, as the first round of twelve mailgirls had had the 12:30 that day, while Thirteen, Twenty-One, and the others were now enjoying their own longest break of the day.<br>
<br>
Twenty-One had been granted permission to remove her nipple clamps, and so it stood to reason that Thirteen would be allowed to do so, as well. "Mistress," Thirteen asked politely, "May I remove my clamps?"<br>
<br>
The older woman sized her up, taking her in from top to bottom, before finally responding, "No. I'll take them off at the end of lunch."<br>
<br>
Thirteen was frustrated, and her breasts were sore, but it did her no good to complain. There was no benefit to letting Mistress Zero see that frustration, no upside in protesting. And so Thirteen, nipples in a vice and ass aglow, offered a perfunctory, "Thank you, Mistress," and returned to her locker.<br>
<br>
Thirteen's locker was mostly empty, with nothing inside but what she'd brought with her that day. Most of the other girls approached their lockers in a similar fashion, as anything they brought in with them could be used as a form of torment against them. Mistress Zero had proven she was not above cutting up a girl's clothes, or even pilfering a bra or set of panties (presumably on behalf of one of the analysts up in Human Capital). There were exceptions, though - Ten, for instance, had a half dozen pairs of shoes and five or six different outfits, and Twenty-Four had previously kept a picture of her boyfriend taped to the back of her locker.<br>
<br>
But Thirteen did have her personal phone, with her purse, sitting her locker. And, as she returned from her spanking, she risked a glance at it. It wasn't against policy, per se, but Thirteen tried to avoid doing so as much as possible, as her life "out there" was a painful reminder of her life "in here." As if to drive that point home, she immediately regretted it - she had three missed calls and a pair of desperate sounding texts from her sister Sophie.<br>
<br>
"I know you're at work, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE call me!!"<br>
<br>
Given that Thirteen had confessed to her sister what her work actually entailed that summer, she was glad that Sophie hadn't put quotes around "work."<br>
<br>
And then the next message: "I'm freaking out! I need to talk to you NOW. It's IMPORTANT!!"<br>
<br>
Both were from around eleven o'clock. But both would have to wait. Even if she were willing to pick up the phone and call, Thirteen couldn't have talked for long - she needed to eat. She could have shot a text back, sure, but there was something about trying to have a conversation with Sophie with clamps on her nipples that pierced the divide between worlds a bit too much for Thirteen's liking. And so, guiltily, she slid the phone back into her purse and the purse back into the locker.<br>
<br>
More likely than not, Sophie's 911 emergency had to do with John, her fiancée. They had gotten engaged around Christmas the year before, and were planning a Fall wedding. Planning a wedding could be stressful, and Thirteen understood that. But, more and more, it was planning the marriage that had Sophie freaking out. She'd been with John since high school. She'd gone to Pomona; he'd gone to Harvey Mudd. They were both now at UCLA, entering their second year of dental school. And Sophie worried about her whole life being planned out so soon; she was just twenty-three, and overly concerned about having no new great adventures in front of her.<br>
<br>
Sophie had had the audacity to make that complaint that summer while visiting, not long after Thirteen had walked through the door wearing a slave collar and recounted her own great summer adventure.<br>
<br>
It could wait. Get through the day, Thirteen told herself, and talk Sophie off the ledge that night.<br>
<br>
She glanced down the row of lockers. Fourteen wasn't beside her this time; apparently she'd had First Lunch. But Fifteen and Sixteen were both further down the line, as were Nineteen and Twenty-One. On the other side of the locker room, Thirteen cast about for Seven - but Seven, too, was nowhere to be seen, and Thirteen felt disappointed that she wasn't going to see her much today. Oh well, she thought to herself, knowing at least she'd be able to say her goodbyes that night at the Imperial.<br>
<br>
A few of the other girls were still eating their lunches. Many of them had taken the opportunity to touch themselves earlier, while Thirteen and Twenty-One had been otherwise occupied by Mistress Zero. And so now they were trickling into the showers, a few minutes ahead of Thirteen, who was just now getting to her hands and knees for lunch.<br>
<br>
She'd stepped over the bowl to check her phone, but Thirteen hadn't needed to confirm what was in her dish - the menu didn't change. For snack, for lunch, and for the occasional dinner, the girls were all fed a thick, protein-infused porridge that had all the consistency and taste of dog food. To hear Human Capital defend it, "mailgirl chow" had all of the vitamins, nutrients, sugars, and carbohydrates that they needed to maintain their weight and perform their job, stripped of all extraneous tastes, shapes, and textures of a normal meal. The taste and smell had been repulsive at first, but Thirteen could admit that such a strict, regulated diet, combined with the unprecedented amount of exercise and stress she put her body through daily at the Plaza, had her in the best shape of her life. She wasn't eating for taste or texture - she was eating for fuel. And besides, she had read of mailgirl programs that fed their girls actual dog food, so she knew she should be grateful for what was in her bowl.<br>
<br>
There were only twelve bowls for twenty-four girls, and some of those very same bowls were left out over morning and afternoon breaks. They were washed by the Evening Shift girls at night, but by time that Thirteen stuck her face into the dog dish at her locker, it may have been eaten from by two, three, or any number of other girls over the course of the day. Their diet was tightly controlled, and any girl who tipped a bit too heavy on the scales was given a half-sized helping; any girl who was getting a bit too light was given a double. They were expected to eat all that given to them, and even to lick the bowl clean - a less than sanitary rule in practice, given that Thirteen could have been eating from the very same bowl Fourteen had eaten from earlier.<br>
<br>
She hoped it had been Seven.<br>
<br>
The girls weren't allowed to use their hands, either, which meant there was a row of naked mailgirls, collared and on all fours, eating out of dog dishes like animals. Thirteen had found herself wondering, on more than one occasion, what sort of twisted pervert viewed this as turn-on.<br>
<br>
As she ate, the silver nipple clamps hung from her breasts, swaying this way and that, and tugging gently at her. At one point they even clanged loudly against her dish, which caused a minor chuckle from Fifteen - a chuckle that Thirteen had to share in. Her whole situation was ridiculous, and the only thing she could do was laugh. The fact that her paddling would be obvious to anyone who saw her, at least for the next couple of hours, was almost funnier than embarrassing, almost more comical than painful.<br>
<br>
Corporal punishment might have seemed a step too far for even the most understanding of mailgirl apologists, but it had been an important aspect of mailgirl programs since their inception. Sure, there were successful programs for which enough demerits earned a girl a longer shift, or a lost weekend, or a cut in pay, or some other non-physical punishment. But spankings and paddlings remained pervasive in mailgirl culture worldwide, and Thirteen had found that even those programs that loudly proclaimed to be above the practice often still had regular instances occurring behind closed doors.<br>
<br>
For detractors, the abuse was symptomatic of the abuse of mailgirls overall, and the fact that such punishment was often delivered by a dominant male figure only further emboldened their push to have the practice of mailgirls done away with altogether. United American Women, or UAW, had led the protests when mailgirl programs began to pop up on the West Coast, but they'd been joined by all manners of feminist organizations both Stateside and abroad. American Association of Professional Women. Femininsts For Equality. People for the Ethical Treatment of Mailgirls. And so on. For these groups, corporal punishment was an anathema. But then, for them, every single aspect of the mailgirl phenomenon was an anathema.<br>
<br>
More interesting to Thirteen was the number of women's rights groups and other feminist organizations that had risen up in defense of mailgirl programs. For these groups, the argument was framed almost in a freedom-of-choice, my-body/my-rights sort of way, a worldview that Thirteen found herself increasingly aligned to as she approached the end of her time as a mailgirl. Submission and subjugation may not have been for everyone, but they were all volunteers. They all signed daily confirmations that said that this was their choice. They could make decisions for themselves, without a powerful women's group deciding if it was right or wrong on the part of their entire gender.<br>
<br>
Sure, many - if not most - were coerced or otherwise bullied into volunteering, and threatened with retribution if they dared to leave. But, interestingly, one of the findings that Thirteen had picked up in her research was how former mailgirls themselves had lined up on one side of the debate or the other. Mailgirls who quit during their contracts lined up overwhelmingly against mailgirl programs anywhere, while those mailgirls who'd completed their contracts and moved on tended to line up overwhelmingly in favor.<br>
<br>
Thirteen couldn't be sure if this was a misery-loves-company sort of thing, but the experiences of former mailgirls - successful mailgirls, who'd gone in one side and come out the other - was a research area she planned to devote more time to. A shockingly high percentage of girls signed on for a second, third, or fourth contract, even when they weren't being coerced to do so. Many continued on as mailgirls without a contract, enduring their daily abuse and humiliation despite being free from retaliatory penalties. She read accounts of girls who'd received promised promotions and agreed-upon raises, only for them to find something missing, to find that they had been happier as a lowly, naked mailgirl than they were in Marketing or Human Resources or Operations. Girls who got out for a year or two, only to go back. There were groups of former mailgirls who met both formally and informally, often in the nude, to share experiences and find something in one another that non-mailgirls simply couldn't understand. There was a group of former mailgirls in Berlin, for whom talk and sharing and support hadn't been enough, which had devolved into a kinky, BDSM sex club with a mailgirl theme. Thirteen wondered what had made Mistress Zero (Mailgirl Funf From Frankfurt once upon a time) come to New York and play dominatrix to a new generation of mailgirls.<br>
<br>
But with her own release upon her, Thirteen found herself understanding the difficult-to-escape nature of being a mailgirl. She certainly wasn't proud of everything she'd done that summer, and there were more than a few things that caused her to cringe just thinking about them. But she was proud of herself that she'd seen it through, and proud that she'd been strong enough to survive everything that USF had thrown at her. She felt that she knew herself better than she had coming into the summer, even if some of that introspection left her feeling uncomfortable about what she'd found. And, of course, she was now more sexually alive, sexually experienced, and sexually realized than she ever could have imagined.<br>
<br>
No, it wasn't an experience that she looked forward to confessing to her mother. But, despite all of the abuse and exposure and humiliation that came with being a mailgirl, it felt wrong to deny another girl that opportunity for self-realization and self-discovery, that sense of freedom in submission, that sexual awakening. Her sister had complained of a lack of adventure in her life; Thirteen would never be able to make that same complaint.<br>
<br>
Thirteen dutifully licked her silver dog dish clean, wiped her face with the back of her hand, and then proceeded to lick the back her hand clean, as well.<br>
<br>
She stood, brought her bowl to Mistress Zero's desk, and added it to the stack on the floor. As she walked back to her locker, she slid off her lycra armband, and placed the smartphone into its charger. She turned, crossed the room, and joined Nineteen and Twenty-One on the shower block to the near side of the locker room.<br>
<br>
Nineteen, a stunning, dark-haired girl of obvious Italian descent, was seated on the tiled floor beneath one of the shower heads, her legs splayed wide open and her pussy covered in the white lather of shaving cream. She had a razor in one hand, and was entirely focused on making sure that her pussy was meticulously devoid of any hint of pubic hair. If she'd passed inspection that morning, Thirteen doubted that Nineteen could have anything like a "twelve o'clock shadow," and suspected that this was being done only at Mistress Zero's instruction. It was probably entirely pettiness on the part of their supervisor. But as the cold water splashed against Thirteen's nipples, she was forced to recognize that she hadn't escaped Mistress Zero's pettiness herself.<br>
<br>
She wondered if nipple clamps rusted.<br>
<br>
Thirteen hadn't bothered to take her hair out, the pigtails bouncing mockingly in her reflection. This wasn't a full, top-to-bottom shower like she'd taken first thing that morning, like she'd take again that evening, but rather a quick rinse - enough to wash the sweat and grime of the morning away, enough to at least offer a temporary reprieve from the smell of body odor and the musky, feminine stink of pussy. She soaped herself up, rinsed herself down, and did her best to ignore the tiny little aftershocks of her most recent orgasm as her hands ran over her naked skin. She paid particular attention to the soles of her feet, which had the tendency to turn dark and dirty from the poorly-cleaned stairs between floors.<br>
<br>
While all the girls delivered mail barefoot, Thirteen had actually been allowed to wear shoes on her deliveries one day in late July. No, "allowed" was probably the wrong word. It had been a punishment, dreamt up by Mistress Zero, and her footwear had consisted of a ridiculous pair of stiletto heels. Her delivery deadlines had been adjusted accordingly, but by the end of the day Thirteen's feet had ached like never before. No thank you, she thought herself; she'd take any number of paddlings or any amount of time in these nipples clamps over that particular hell again.<br>
<br>
Once she was toweled off - with deodorant, perfume, and make-up re-applied, with her teeth brushed, and with the smartphone and armband back in their rightful place around her arm - Thirteen glanced at the clock, and confirmed she still had a few minutes before she had to take her place at her locker. She snuck behind her mistress and peed at one of the open toilets, and then crossed the locker room to Ten's open locker. Ten had apparently been on First Lunch - with Seven, Thirteen recognized jealously - but the cocktail dress she'd promised was hanging in her locker. There were two, in fact, and Thirteen couldn't have been sure which dress Ten had intended to loan her, and which dress was for Ten herself. Neither, though, were anything that Thirteen would have picked out on her own - one had a neckline that guaranteed Thirteen's cleavage would be spilling out of, and both had hemlines so short that she'd be tugging them down all night, and on-guard to keep from inadvertently flashing everyone at the Imperial's bar. There were any number of girls who went out to Friday night Bitch Sessions without panties, and Thirteen had joined in on this trend more than once. But, tonight, no matter which dress Ten let her borrow, Thirteen knew they'd be a necessity.<br>
<br>
Leaving the cocktail dresses be, Thirteen crossed back to her side of the locker room, and clipped herself back onto her leash. She took her position on her knees, and waited for the clock to reach the bottom of the hour, for Mistress Zero to release her back into the wilds of USF Plaza. Her mind drifted back to her cell phone, and back to her sister, and she cursed herself for having even glanced at it. Sophie's drama threatened the zen-like peace Thirteen sought - the blank, empty-headed mindset and pure Point-A-to-Point-B functionality of a mailgirl. So, instead, she chose to focus on her nipples, still being pinched and squeezed, and her buttocks, still stinging from the attention they'd received. This was Thirteen's life - not the quarter-life crisis of a second-year dental student stressing over her upcoming nuptials.<br>
<br>
And, as she focused on her own sore and aching body, she felt another familiar ache. She knew that she was already wet again.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As much as Thirteen kept trying to refocus herself on her life as Mailgirl Number Thirteen, her other life (her real life?) kept intruding. Perhaps it was simply a result of the fact that she was now only a few hours short of being set free. Perhaps it was the pain of not being able to get back to her sister when she needed her. The fact that her next delivery was to Kim Kinney in Investment Banking on the 41st Floor, where she'd inevitably run into Drew Wagner, certainly didn't help.<br>
<br>
Her first call after lunch was down the stairs to the actual mailroom on B-2. In earlier iterations of mailgirls, the mailroom and the girls' locker room had been one and the same; in fact, the term "mailroom girls" pre-dated the now much more common "mailgirls." Oftentimes it had been a simple garden hose, or a janitor's closet and mop sink, which had served the purposes of making sure they girls were all showered and shaved. And the girls had gotten undressed and lined up in the mailroom itself, under the supervision of whoever just happened to be in charge of the actual mailroom at the time. And, while there were still plenty of companies that continued to follow that model, a new generation of programs had built specific facilities for their girls - palatial, by comparison. USF had adopted this later model, converting an underutilized fitness center into something akin to mailgirl terrarium, with lockers, showers, sinks, and even bathroom facilities (such as they were) all visible through a wall of mirror glass on the 2nd Floor.<br>
<br>
The separation made sense. The girls often managed to make the rounds and deliver all of the day's regular mail by mid-morning, and maybe seventy-five percent of Thirteen's time was otherwise devoted to running interoffice envelopes from one floor to another, or carrying electronic messages on her smartphone from place to place, or restocking supplies. Hiding the girls away in the basement, moreover, missed the very point of the girls' presence entirely - they needed to be visible, they needed to be out in the open, they needed to be something everyone was reminded of as much as possible.<br>
<br>
But, in taking over the bulk of the regular mail duties, the mailgirls had displaced a number of previously employed mailroom staff members. Which was perhaps why Paul Hooper, the nominal head of the mail room, didn't seem to enjoy the opportunity to rub elbows with the girls as much as one might have expected; he'd been forced to let a good number of his friends and employees go, and seen his span of control shrink accordingly.<br>
<br>
"Look at those fucking pigtails," Hooper said aloud, to no one in particular. "They're like fucking handles. I bet someone upstairs is holding on to them while he jams his dick down her throat."<br>
<br>
Thirteen took the abuse with a smile - a smile Hooper couldn't see. She was in her "Feet" position, standing with her arms behind her and her legs spread, but with her back to the rest of the mailroom and her face only a few inches from the wall. As a general rule, USF advised their employees against such direct, verbal abuse of the mailgirls - though it still happened regularly. Hooper, though, had reasoned he could get away with it if that abuse wasn't specifically directed at a mailgirl, but rather spoken aloud, to himself, while the mailgirl faced away from him in the corner of the room. It was likely only a loophole in Hooper's own mind; but the girls hadn't reported him, and Hooper knew enough to knock it off if Mistress Zero or someone else was around.<br>
<br>
He was a mean son of a bitch, too. There were twenty-four mailgirls at USF, plus a few more that had come and gone, and every single one of them was drop-dead gorgeous, plucked from the cream-of-the-crop here at the Plaza. And, still, Hooper always managed to identify that one particular body issue that managed to get under a girl's skin - Five's teeth were uneven, Seven's nose was too big, Nine's hips were too wide, Fifteen's ass was too high. And so on, and so on. He'd managed to tease Thirteen for "not belonging," for the idea that USF was just letting "anyone" become a mailgirl - insinuating that Thirteen wasn't quite as pretty as the rest of the girls, something that she'd been anxious about ever since she'd first volunteered. It was a ridiculous assertion; even in her least confident moments, one would have argued that Thirteen was objectively more attractive than at least eight or nine of the other girls. But Hooper had nonetheless managed to sniff out her particular neurosis, and needle her accordingly.<br>
<br>
Despite the abuse, however, the girls had turned a corner with Hooper relatively early on, and his derision and scorn was met with nothing more than mock horror and a sense of humor. Among the stories swapped back and forth at the Imperial on Friday nights, more than a few revolved around the horrible things that Hooper had hurled their way, shared with shrieks of laughter. They'd even begun to call him "Master Hooper" behind his back, embracing the absurdity that they were all now just slave girls in his little fiefdom. When one of the girls had slipped, and accidentally referred to him as "Master" to his face, Hooper took the title and ran with it; it was now expected that all the girls refer to him as "Master," rather than "Sir."<br>
<br>
But if Thirteen got off light that afternoon, in terms of verbal abuse, Hooper had nonetheless found another way to torment her. She had tried to beg off a run to the 41st floor earlier in the summer, and he hadn't forgotten; there was little doubt that he'd called for her, specifically, to handle a lightweight package headed that way that day after lunch.<br>
<br>
"Enjoy," he smiled at her cruelly, when she was beckoned over to take the package. No, he hadn't forgotten.<br>
<br>
"Yes, master," Thirteen answered, with a lump in her throat.<br>
<br>
It certainly wasn't the first time she'd been sent up to Investment Banking. In fact, given Hooper's memory, she was probably up that way more than most of the other girls. But repetition hadn't, in this case, made the deliveries any easier, and she suspected that this was what many of the other mailgirls felt when sent back to their old stomping grounds in the building. Thirteen hadn't worked at the Plaza prior to becoming a mailgirl; but she had gone to college with Drew Wagner, now an investment banker with USF.<br>
<br>
She got into the service elevator with the package under her arm, pressed the button for the 41st Floor, and waited for the doors to close.<br>
<br>
It was inevitable that people outside of USF would find out about how Thirteen had spent her summer. She had told a small handful of friends at Yale, fellow anthropology students who understood why she was doing what she was doing, even if they never could have done so themselves. She'd been forced to share her life with her sister earlier in the summer, when Mistress Zero had sent her home in a dog collar while Sophie was visiting. And, given that her mother still read every one of her papers and any potential publication, she'd have to share with Catherine Ryan sooner or later.<br>
<br>
Thirteen absentmindedly massaged her nipples with her free hand, still sore from the clamps.<br>
<br>
Hearing about Thirteen's life as a mailgirl or reading about it in a dry academic study, however, was different than witnessing her humiliation in real life. That honor belonged to Drew - with whom she'd gone to college, with whom she'd attended a fair number of classes, with whom she shared more than a few friends and acquaintances. They hadn't been close in Malibu, but they knew a good number of the same people - and Thirteen was well aware that there were now a handful of cell phone photos circulating out there amongst her former classmates. She hadn't seen the photos herself, but she knew they'd be awful based on the reaction of a handful of people she still kept in touch with. She received a couple of nasty emails from former friends accusing her of "selling out" their gender. And she'd gotten a number of supportive emails, as well, that still managed to focus on her naked body (for example, "The pictures aren't that bad - your ass looks amazing!"). The bulk of the reaction, however, came in the form of group emails and email chains that found their way to her, which did little more than laugh at her expense.<br>
<br>
The service elevator chimed its arrival on the 41st Floor. Thirteen took a deep breath, and then set off at a good clip towards her intended mailstop, hoping against hope that Drew and his colleagues were in a meeting, and intending to get through with this embarrassment as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Mailgirls knew better than to get their hopes up for anything working in their favor, however, and Drew was waiting for her - along with Nick McInnis, Jeff Jones, and Kim Kinney - in the bullpen he called home here at the Plaza. It was the woman, Kim, whose presence made Thirteen the most nervous; as physically threatening as being naked around fully dressed men could be, Thirteen had found that it was women who were often the most cruel. And, Kim Kinney was among the worst of them. The fact that the package was apparently hers, and the fact that Thirteen was greeted with a wide, ear-to-ear grin, filled her with dread.<br>
<br>
Thirteen swallowed, and looked to Drew for support.<br>
<br>
Drew Wagner was tall, muscular, and good-looking in a way that suggested men like him were printed out in a factory for models, teen soap actors, and romantic leads. His hair was ever-so-slightly tussled, a hairdo that was supposed to look casual and disinterested - but which Thirteen suspected he'd spent significantly more time on than she had hers. The Drew Wagner she'd known had been a jock in college; he hadn't been a "nice guy," per se, but he'd certainly never come off the way he did now, surrounded by jerks and bullies here in Investment Banking. No, Drew wasn't going to come to her rescue.<br>
<br>
As Thirteen handed the package to Kim, the other woman's smile broadened, and she handed the package back. "This is actually for you."<br>
<br>
Thirteen was confused, but she took the package back, unsure of what to do next.<br>
<br>
Kim Kinney was about her age - maybe a year older, or a year younger - and would have fit right in among the perfect tens that populated the mailgirl stable. She had dark, raven black hair that hung at chin-length, penetrating blue eyes, and a smile that always hinted at a mischievous sort of intelligence. Her breasts, hidden beneath a white blouse and a just-visible black lace bra, were admittedly on the smallish side, but they complemented a slender, girlish figure that had the power to turn heads even when fully dressed. Today, she wore a dark, tight-fitting pencil skirt and a pair of heels, and seemed very much as at home as the three suited men around her.<br>
<br>
"Go on," Kim told her, nodding at the package with her chin. "Open it."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ms. Kinney," Thirteen answered. She wasn't sure what was inside the box, but she knew it would be awful. But she steeled herself, knowing that all this would be over soon, and that it would go easier if she didn't fight.<br>
<br>
"Wait," the woman stopped her. "Open it on your knees."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ms. Kinney," Thirteen answered again, and dutifully got down on the floor. She began removing the brown parcel wrapping, trying to guess what sort of horror awaited her based on the weight. The box was too big, but light, to be any sort of sex toy. If anything, it felt like a shirt box, with clothes inside. But, of course, that certainly couldn't be the case.<br>
<br>
But, of course, it was. With Kim, Drew, and the two other men looking on and laughing, Thirteen removed the top of the box, and knew instantly what it was. White, with orange and blue stripes, and the word "Waves" printed across the chest, Thirteen recognized it as a call back to her alma mater - a cheerleader's outfit from Pepperdine. What she was supposed to do with it, however, was beyond her.<br>
<br>
It seemed that Kim had ideas, though. "Jeff, you have a few chits. Keep her here for a couple of minutes so that she can try it on."<br>
<br>
Thirteen blushed all over. She looked to Drew, and then back to Kim, still not fully understanding. She stammered, "I-I-I can't put this on." Then, immediately catching herself, amended her protestation with a "Ms. Kinney."<br>
<br>
Jeff had his smartphone in his hand, and was obediently spending a few of his delivery chits. But so did Kim, and Thirteen could feel the vibration of a demerit hitting her own unit without having to look to confirm.<br>
<br>
"I can't be out of uniform, Ms. Kinney," Thirteen stated. Mailgirls were strictly forbidden from wearing clothes at the Plaza.<br>
<br>
Kim didn't even bother responding. Instead, she tapped her phone, and Thirteen felt the unit on her arm vibrate once more.<br>
<br>
Thirteen found herself trying to think of a loophole, an out. There'd been that day she'd been forced to wear heels. There was the time she'd been called on to play the part of a waitress in the Executive Dining Room, and been given a lacey pink headband and a short, matching gingham-print apron that just barely covered her sex. There was when Nine had been told to make deliveries in fishnet stockings, or when Eighteen had worn black leather gloves, or even the time that Four - during her "time of the month" - had actually been allowed to wear a pair of red panties. So, there were exceptions, but this seemed to be entirely different...<br>
<br>
Another vibration. Another demerit. Another vibration. Another demerit. Thirteen's hesitation was getting costly.<br>
<br>
She was in a damned-if-I-do, damned-if-I-don't situation. She could be punished severely if Mistress Zero caught wind of her in clothes, but she could be punished just as severely if she picked up too many demerits too quickly - at the rate that Kim was logging them, Thirteen's lunch-time paddling might not have been her last of the summer. She was in trouble either way, and so she decided to give in; the possibility of being punished later for donning the cheerleader's outfit was outweighed by the guarantee of a punishment if Kim kept logging demerits.<br>
<br>
Thirteen met Kim's eyesight momentarily, just long enough to signal the surrender, and then turned her attention back to the uniform. It was in two pieces - a white tank, with a thick orange stripe and two blue stripes running down either side, and a matching white skirt beneath it. The outfit looked two or three sizes too small, but she supposed that had been the intent. As she wriggled into the top, she felt it flatten her chest, even as it stopped at her mid-riff just above her belly button.<br>
<br>
The vibration of the demerits on Thirteen's arm had stopped, but Kim hadn't put her cell phone down. Instead, she had it pointed at Thirteen and was snapping away. And she wasn't even the only one - Drew's was out, as well, and Thirteen knew full well that these pictures would soon be making the rounds, too. But again, Thirteen recognized that that had most likely been the intent all along.<br>
<br>
The bottomless blonde had to stand to put on the skirt, but wasn't allowed off her knees without someone's permission. Kim, laughing, granted this to her, and Thirteen rose to her feet. She bent at the midsection, aware that someone else's camera was clicking behind her, and slipped the skirt up over her knees and up her thighs. Thankfully - and Thirteen recognized that this was an odd thing to be thankful about - there were no "lollipop" briefs to go along with the skirt; her pussy would still be bare. The skirt hung to mid-thigh - there'd be no modesty to fret over if she were asked to do anything but stand.<br>
<br>
If Thirteen had expected Drew to come to her rescue, she was severely disappointed. As he snapped another picture of her, now in full cheerleader regalia, he called past her to Kim, "Give her your boots!"<br>
<br>
The dark-haired girl laughed with a shriek, but shook her head. "No," she said. "You've seen the bottom of their feet. They're filthy."<br>
<br>
Nevermind that, having just taken a shower at lunch, Thirteen's soles were perhaps cleaner than they'd be all day. But the uniform was humiliating enough - she didn't need Kim Kinney's boots to complete the ensemble.<br>
<br>
Drew shrugged off the idea, and snapped another couple of quick pictures. It was Nick, next to him, that suggested, "Have her lift up the front of the skirt." To Thirteen, he repeated, "Lift up the front of your skirt."<br>
<br>
Now that they'd gotten her fully clothed, they were having her expose herself all over again? Thirteen didn't protest, and obediently lifted the front of her skirt to show her pussy. But she did wince as Drew took another shot, and she knew instantly it would be that one that would get the best circulation among her former classmates.<br>
<br>
"Mark Agnew," Drew said aloud, and Thirteen cringed once more. "You dated Mark Agnew, right?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Thirteen answered. She'd lost her virginity to him, as a sophomore. Not that Drew was asking. She dumbly stood there, holding up the front of her cheerleader's skirt, as Drew snapped yet another picture.<br>
<br>
"And he ended up marrying...?"<br>
<br>
It was a leading question. Mark hadn't exactly cheated on her, but he'd broken up with Thirteen to start dating someone else. "Steph Thomas," Thirteen replied. Mark had broken up with her for Stephanie Thomas, from Arizona, who he'd later gone on to marry.<br>
<br>
Drew chuckled to himself cruelly. "Turn around," he told her, "and lift the back." As she complied, Drew added, "Jesus. Wait until they see this."<br>
<br>
It was enough to almost bring tears to Thirteen - the thought of Mark, with his now wife, laughing at her, laughing at the situation she'd found herself in, laughing at the decisions she'd made. But mailgirls didn't cry - Thirteen choked it back, and suffered her humiliation in silence.<br>
<br>
For all the petty rules and regulations that girls were supposed to live by (how to stand, how to eat, how to address their superiors, and so on), there wasn't any specific prohibition against bawling in public. It was a common enough occurrence in a girl's first day or two, as she was embarrassed and beaten up in her new life. But the older mailgirls - that is, those girls who'd been mailgirls longer, regardless of their actual age - took them under their wing, and made clear that this reaction was forbidden by the mailgirls themselves.<br>
<br>
Seven had joined the roster of USF mailgirls only a week prior to Thirteen and her particular cohort, having replaced the prior Mailgirl Number Seven. But it had been Seven who'd wrapped her arm around Thirteen in the showers on Thirteen's second day, and told her to never let anyone at USF see her cry again. Masturbation was allowed - almost encouraged, in fact - among the mailgirls; the girls were allowed to give in and give away how much their current situation turned them on. But they weren't allowed to cry, they weren't allowed to show Mistress Zero or Will Barrow or anyone else at the Plaza how much the abuse and humiliation affected them in that way. On a daily basis, there were any number of times that Thirteen could have broken down, sobbing, but she took that wisdom to heart.<br>
<br>
"Bend over," Jeff spoke up now, rolling his chair over closer to Drew and Nick so that he could get a better look."<br>
<br>
"'Ankles,'" Kim corrected.<br>
<br>
Thirteen spread her legs, and clutched her ankles. Her legs were spread, and the cheerleader's skirt was now nothing more than a belt around her midsection. Her pussy was fully exposed to the three men behind her. The camera phones continued to click, click, click, click.<br>
<br>
"You know your positions," Jeff teased Kim. Even upside-down, Thirteen could see that he'd cocked an eyebrow. "Maybe there's a future in this for you."<br>
<br>
"Har, har," Kim laughed back sarcastically. To hear Twenty-Two tell it, Kim Kinney was as good a mailgirl candidate as any, but simply made the Investment Banking division too much money for them to strip her and shackle her up on the 2nd Floor. "I'm not sure I can take it the way this little cunt can." With that, she smacked Thirteen's naked ass with her bare hand; Thirteen's skin, still sensitive from the paddling she'd only just received, was on fire.<br>
<br>
"Stand up," Kim instructed her. "Turn around. Fix the bottom."<br>
<br>
Thirteen did as she was told. "Yes, Ms. Kinney."<br>
<br>
"Now here," she said, stepping closer to Thirteen, and hooking her thumb into the waistband of the skirt. She gave a tug, and pulled it down just so, so that Thirteen's pussy was still covered, but the black ink number thirteen was now fully exposed. "Hold it that way."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ms. Kinney."<br>
<br>
Turning to her coworkers, Kim pointed at the number on Thirteen's hip. "That's the shot you want." She turned back to Thirteen, even as she continued to address the others. "I bet she's more embarrassed about that than she is about her pussy."<br>
<br>
It was true. As embarrassing as any crotch shot or exposed nipple might be, the mailgirl number spoke volumes about Thirteen's life at USF. She didn't need to be bent at the midsection with her ass cheeks spread to be truly humiliated - the mailgirl phenomenon had now become common enough that the number alone represented a life choice that Thirteen had consciously made, one that undoubtedly meant public nudity, public masturbation, and an embracing of the life of a slut.<br>
<br>
Thirteen bit her lip.<br>
<br>
As another round of pictures were snapped, Kim eyed her up and down like a predator. "I bet you're wet," she whispered to Thirteen, just softly enough that she couldn't be heard over the sounds of the three men laughing amongst themselves. "I bet you're going to go back downstairs and get yourself off."<br>
<br>
Thirteen said nothing.<br>
<br>
Kim glanced down at her phone, and then back to Thirteen. She looked over the blonde girl's shoulder, and made sure that no one else was watching, that no one else was coming to interrupt. "I've got one more present for you, seeing that it's your last day." This, now, was spoken loud enough that it was clear it was intended more for the audience than for Thirteen. She bent down, and reached into her purse.<br>
<br>
While still crouching, Kim used her other hand to lift the front of Thirteen's hemline. To Drew, she asked, "Are you sure you don't want a quick taste? Now's your last chance."<br>
<br>
Thirteen's back stiffened.<br>
<br>
Drew, however, was not going to rise to the challenge. Instead, he looked back at Kim defiantly and answered, "You first."<br>
<br>
It was at that point that Kim produced a decent-sized round lollipop from her bag, and showed it off to the three men. "Are you sure?"<br>
<br>
Jeff guffawed, and Nick laughed. Drew, however, glanced nervously down the corridor, and then back to Kim.<br>
<br>
To Thirteen, Kim ordered, "Put this in your pussy."<br>
<br>
There was no question that Thirteen was willing to do it - Thirteen knew that, and she knew that Kim Kinney knew that, as well. "I can't," Thirteen stammered, however. "I can't. I can't do that."<br>
<br>
Kim stood, and reached for her phone. Thirteen gritted her teeth and closed her eyes as the smartphone on her arm vibrated with a new demerit.<br>
<br>
"Take off your top," Kim now added. "And put this in your pussy."<br>
<br>
Kim's thumb touched her phone again. Another vibration. Another touch. Another vibration. Another touch. Another vibration.<br>
<br>
Thirteen peeled the tank from her body, over her head, and let her breasts pop free. She tossed it, carelessly, so that it hung over the side of Kim's cubicle. And, though she was now complying, she apparently wasn't complying fast enough - Kim charged her with another demerit.<br>
<br>
Topless, but still clad in a tight-fitting white cheerleader's skirt, Thirteen grabbed the lollipop from her tormentor's grip, and tore off the wrapper. It was cherry red. But it wasn't for Thirteen to taste; even as another demerit registered against her arm, she plunged the candy inside of herself.<br>
<br>
There was no resistance. Thirteen was every bit as wet as Kim had suspected, and her pussy was every bit as hungry for the lollipop as it might have been for Drew himself - or for Jeff, or Nick, or Mark Agnew.<br>
<br>
"How much time?" Kim asked Jeff, and jutted her chin towards his cell phone.<br>
<br>
Jeff shook his head. "She's got to go." When met with exasperation and accusing looks from his coworkers, he put it hands up, "Sorry, I don't rate more chits. If you guys had any of your own..."<br>
<br>
There were moments throughout the day that Thirteen teetered on the edge of an orgasm, where just about anything might have set her off. This wasn't quite yet one of them, but she felt relief at Jeff's answer nonetheless; if she had to stay here as their plaything for a few more minutes, there was no telling what might happen. No, she told herself - she knew exactly what would happen.<br>
<br>
"A parting gift from your classmate," Kim said to Drew, holding out her fingers for Thirteen to hand over the lollipop. When Thirteen was slow to respond, Kim made a movement towards her phone, and Thirteen produced the candy. The two girls shared a look - one that, beneath all of the scorn and derision, Thirteen thought she saw through to a hint of intrigue in Kim's eyes. It was a look that demonstrated Kim could see to the depths of Thirteen's debasement and depravity, one that Kim had a difficult time looking away from - if only for the briefest of seconds.<br>
<br>
As Kim handed the lollipop to Drew, grasping carefully at the stick end, Drew recoiled in mock digust. Even if he wanted to taste it, he apparently needed to at least make a show of reluctance.<br>
<br>
Nick McInnis showed no such hesitation. Without even bothering to take the lollipop from Kim's hand, he leaned forward and sucked the candy into his mouth. He made an exaggerated show of tasting it, of tasting Thirteen, and then coughed a false cough. "Delicious," he said, to Drew. To Kim, he popped the lollipop out of his mouth and offered it to her. He asked, "Are you next?"<br>
<br>
Thirteen felt her arm vibrate once more, and she looked confusedly at Kim. Only when Kim met her look with a surprised look of her own did Thirteen realize what it was; Jeff's chits had run out, and she was now being summoned to a pick-up on the 46th Floor.<br>
<br>
"You can go," Kim said to her.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Ms. Kinney," Thirteen replied. She found herself disappointed she couldn't stay for a few moments longer, if only to see if Kim would accept Nick's offering. Why did that turn her on?<br>
<br>
It was only after she took a step or two away from the bullpen that Thirteen realized she was still wearing the skirt.<br>
<br>
"May I take this off, Ms. Kinney?" she asked.<br>
<br>
Kim smiled cruelly, took a moment to pretend to think it over, and then finally responded. "Yes. But please fold it and put it back in the box."<br>
<br>
The men behind her all laughed and chittered, Drew among them. This was nothing more than an attempt to make Thirteen late, to ensure she picked up a demerit or two or three from her next pick-up; given that it was up on the 46th Floor, it was likely that this was one of the company's senior-most executives or an executive assistant, and Thirteen desperately wanted to avoid being late as much as she could control. She slipped out of and folded the skirt quickly, and put it in the box. Then she reached for the tank and did the same, closing the lid and handing the whole thing to Drew. She dared to look into his eyes for a moment; she'd meant for it to come off accusingly, but she suspected there was more desperation in her eyes than she'd have hoped.<br>
<br>
"I don't think it's my size," he chuckled. Beside him, Nick continued to suck on the cherry-and-pussy-flavored lollipop.<br>
<br>
"I think this was actually for you, sir," Thirteen replied. She didn't wait for a response. Without turning to look back, she was off, dashing for the stairs at full-tilt, hoping she'd make it up to the 46th Floor in time.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
From the 46th, Thirteen was sent all the way back down to 7th Floor, and then proceeded to spend the bulk of that afternoon bouncing around the teens and single digit floors. An interoffice here or there, a coffee delivery for a meeting taking place on the 10th, a series of electronic communications that she ferried from floor to floor on her arm. After the run-in with Drew Wagner, Kim Kinney, and the cheerleader's outfit, the rest of the afternoon was filled with more standard fare.<br>
<br>
Mistress Zero had undoubtedly seen the rapid increase in the number of demerits the naked blonde suffered at Kim's hand. But as Thirteen was still on the right side of another punishment, Mistress Zero hadn't said anything to her over her afternoon break. If she hit number twenty-five (and she probably would now, given the numbers she'd wracked up in Investment Banking), would she receive another round of attention from her mistress? It was rare for Mistress Zero to administer a spanking at the end of the day; more often than not, she held back and did so the following morning. But given that Thirteen wasn't going to be here tomorrow, or Monday morning, would she stick around to give the naked blonde one last round of corporal punishment? If Thirteen managed to stay below the threshold, would the German woman find some other way to balance the ledger?<br>
<br>
It was, for the most part, beyond Thirteen's control. She could do her best to hit her deadlines and avoid any more demerits, but that was no different than any other day. As the session with Drew and Kim illustrated, demerits could be handed out almost arbitrarily. So it did Thirteen no good to worry about Mistress Zero, nor about how sore her ass might be on the trip back to New Haven in the morning. Instead, she focused on her deliveries.<br>
<br>
Or, rather, she tried to. The thought of the pictures getting out - and they would - was horrifying and humiliating, but there was a part of her that was turned on by the thought of her former classmates seeing her as some sort of sex object. It was the dichotomy she felt as a mailgirl in a nutshell - suffering and embarrassment on the one hand, surrender and excitement on the other. The idea that Mark Agnew might see her pictures - and he would - sent a thrill up and down her spine. Would he even show them to his wife? Would he keep them hidden away? Would he masturbate to them?<br>
<br>
But as it did her no good to worry about Mistress Zero's plan's for her backside, it did her no good to focus on the pictures Drew and the others had snapped that afternoon; it was all out of her control. The more she thought about it, the more cringe-worthy the whole thing became, and the more she'd be tempted to touch herself again before the day was through.<br>
<br>
And she wanted to. There were plenty of girls - One, Six, Fourteen, Twenty - who'd just completely given in to their baser instincts, and for whom any amount of free time was an opportunity to have their hands between their legs. And then there were the girls on the other end of the spectrum - Five, Eight, Twenty-Four - who'd managed to keep from doing so. Here at the Plaza, at least. Most of the others, however, found themselves somewhere between those two poles, often making little deals with themselves about when and how often they'd relent, compromises about how much they were willing to masturbate in front of an audience. Thirteen had certainly had her "bad" days, when she'd touched herself before her shift, after her shift, and during every break in between. And she'd certainly had her "good" days, in which she might be able to escape the day without giving in once; even just once probably now resided in the "good day" column.<br>
<br>
No, she told herself while on her afternoon break. She'd already gotten off twice that day. And even with a chorus of breathily panting girls echoing off the locker room's tiled floor, and even with everything that had gone down with Drew, Thirteen told herself that she could make it to the end of the day. Maybe, just maybe, she'd allow herself the indulgence in the showers once her shift was over. Or maybe it'd be in the misleadingly-named "Kissing Booth" at the Imperial's bar, while another girl stood look-out. Or maybe she could make it to the end of the night, and have one last wild evening with Seven. Or Seven and Ten. Or Seven, Ten, and Nineteen all together; she knew they'd begun renting a hotel room at the Imperial on Friday nights for the last couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
Careful, she told herself as she bounded up the stairs between the 12th and 13th Floors - that's how your self-control falls apart.<br>
<br>
Instead, she chose to focus on Catherine Ryan. Thirteen typically did everything in her power to keeping from thinking about her mother, to avoid letting her non-mailgirl life bleed into her work. But it was now almost five o'clock. With just two hours of her life as Mailgirl Number Thirteen left, she'd begun to think more about her life thereafter.<br>
<br>
How would Catherine respond to Thirteen's revelation? Poorly, Thirteen told herself, to be sure. She wasn't uptight or conservative in any real way. She had two girls who were both on their way to doctorates, but she wasn't a break-the-glass ceiling sort of women's libber for whom such academic achievement was the be-all, end-all. She'd have been just as happy if Thirteen had become a waitress, or a grocery store cashier, or something else; she often told both her girls that she just wanted them to be happy and find meaning in their own lives. Thirteen, though, wasn't sure that extended to her daughter's happiness as a naked, masturbating mailgirl. She'd come close to telling her mother how she was truly spending her summer on more than one occasion, but she'd chickened out each and every time. It was going to be easier, she reassured herself, to tell her after the fact, when she was looking at her summer in the rearview mirror.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the mailgirls at USF rarely brought up their families or friends. And Thirteen understood why. It was the for the same reason that they all continued to refer to one another by their numbers, and not names, when outside the building; it was just easier to forget that they had another life besides this one. But, over the course of the summer, Thirteen had managed to tease their relationships out of them regardless, often framed by looking for advice on how to handle Catherine.<br>
<br>
In contrast to the stereotypical stripper coming from a broken family and an absent father, most of the mailgirls came from fairly mundane and boring backgrounds. Thirteen supposed that, given how academically successful and career-oriented most of them were prior to this life, it probably shouldn't have been all that surprising. Thirteen was just one of three girls at USF whose parents were even divorced. If there were some underlying psychosexual issue that had driven them all to become mailgirls, that had caused them to give in to baser instincts once becoming a mailgirl, it wasn't one that was self-evident. For those girls who'd confessed to their families what their new occupation really was (and Thirteen estimated it was more than half of them), reactions had run the gamut between shock and horror on one end and acceptance and support on the other. Eight's parents had angrily stormed the building and demanded their daughter's release, and Seventeen's had hired a lawyer to do it for them. This was in stark contrast Mailgirl Number Two's mother - who had not only opened her arms to her daughter's new lesbian girlfriend, Mailgirl Number Three, but who'd also opened her house to all the girls for a Sunday barbecue and pool party out on Long Island.<br>
<br>
A more normal reaction might have been that of Seven's parents. They didn't understand Seven's decision, and they themselves were embarrassed by what their daughter had chosen to do with her life (at least, over the next two years). But they recognized she'd been backed into a corner, chose to focus the career opportunity that awaited her on the other side, and did everything in their power to avoid talking about how Seven spent her days. Still, Seven had confessed to Thirteen that her mother had later gotten intensely specific in her line of questioning - once her father wasn't around. And though she hadn't come right out and said so, Seven believed that part of her mother was curious and secretly excited about the fantasy life her daughter was living.<br>
<br>
Thirteen hoped for similar acceptance out of her own mother. She didn't need Catherine to fully understand what she'd been through that summer, but she couldn't hide it from her forever. And Thirteen hoped she'd see if for the professional opportunity that it was, a chance to make a name for herself in the narrow sliver of academia in which she'd chosen to concentrate. Maybe, just maybe, she'd be able to put herself in Thirteen's shoes, and - like Seven's mother - begin to understand what being a mailgirl truly, truly meant.<br>
<br>
Thirteen hit the 13th Floor, and glanced again at the summoning she'd received from Jessica Cochran. She grimaced, seeing an associated spend of chits - not only would she have to be subjected to Jessica's leers (sorry, Miss Cochran's leers), but it looked like she was going to be held here in Finance & Accounting for the better part of the next ten minutes.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had adjusted to the attention she received from men here at the Plaza. She'd always been on the shy side when it came to men, as the fact she'd slept with just four men by her twenty-sixth birthday could attest. But despite that, and despite the fact that she'd always been a bit of a nerd, she still had always received a fair amount of their focus. She was now able to recognize that she was attractive, hot even, in a way that she hadn't prior to becoming a mailgirl; there was something about being reduced to little more than a set of tits and ass that caused one to reflect on what a fine set of tits and ass it was. Men were visual, men were sexually aggressive, and the attention she received while bounding naked from one corner of the building to another was expected, and had now become almost a sort of complement.<br>
<br>
Thirteen hadn't expected the same from women, however. And now, admittedly, vice versa - she couldn't deny how much watching the other girls get themselves off turned her on. She wasn't a lesbian, nor even really and truly bisexual; like any number of the girls, she'd become a "letter-carrying lesbian" for convenience sake. But she found herself open to the idea that her sexuality was more fluid and dynamic that she would have thought it to be three months prior, and so it shouldn't have shocked her that there were other women at USF - even non-mailgirls - who were similarly engaged in a journey of self-discovery.<br>
<br>
Jessica Cochran, an accountant here on the 13th Floor, was Exhibit A. She was engaged - the enormous diamond ring gave her away. And she might have even been happily looking forward to the wedding - the pictures posted in her cubicle showed her smiling alongside a cutely awkward young man about her age. But Thirteen had walked past her just that morning, in the lobby outside of the Mailgirls Locker Room - sitting alone with a cup of coffee and preparing for the show. She'd made deliveries to Finance & Accounting previously, and Thirteen had felt raked up and down by the accountant's eyes. Thirteen wasn't exactly sure what it was - was Miss Cochran a closeted lesbian? Or was it something else, a fantasy about being a mailgirl herself? She was short, and a little on the homely side - if she were going to be a mailgirl, it wasn't going to be here at USF.<br>
<br>
Thirteen was a Sociocultural Anthropologist, who'd come to New York to study "mailgirl culture" firsthand. But her area of study had always been more broadly defined as "women's culture," and she'd increasingly found herself more and more interested in how a mailgirl program affected non-mailgirl female employees. As boorish as men could often be, she found that it was women - fully clothed women - who tended to be meaner, nastier, and more verbally abusive. Kim Kinney, for example. On the other side of the coin were women like Miss Cochran, mailgirl fangirls who seemed intensely intrigued by either the life of a mailgirl or the mailgirls themselves. Female attrition always tended to spike up when a program was first announced; but, in the aftermath of that initial spike, female attrition always seemed to drop even more significantly than male attrition. Thirteen wasn't sure what to make of that paradox. She wasn't sure what it said about the women who remained.<br>
<br>
As she arrived at Miss Cochran's desk, she was unnerved by that cat-who-ate-the-canary grin that the little blonde had on her face. As she usually did, Miss Cochran's eyes went to Thirteen's tits, her hips, her legs, before coming back up to greet the naked mailgirl face-to-face.<br>
<br>
"I'm here for a pick-up, Miss Cochran," Thirteen announced, taking her standing "Feet" position with her arms behind her back and her chest thrust out. Miss Cochran seemed to be waiting for her arrival; Thirteen wasn't sure why she'd opted to spend her chits to hold her here for the next ten minutes.<br>
<br>
"Right this way," Miss Cochran replied sweetly. She stood, and at maybe just barely five feet tall, she was dwarfed by the tall, naked blonde mailgirl beside her desk. "It's in the conference room."<br>
<br>
As Thirteen obediently followed behind, Miss Cochran led her through a rabbit's warren of cubicles to the far side of the building. It was late in the day, on a Friday, and these weren't traders or bankers; Thirteen guessed that more than half of the office drones who worked in Finance & Accounting had already slipped out for the weekend. Still, there were a few. And Miss Cochran, seemingly more for their benefit than for Thirteen's, said loudly, "It's a big one, so I called help. It might take the two of you a few minutes to figure out the best way to carry it."<br>
<br>
Thirteen groaned to herself - not out loud, of course. She'd hoped to run out the last two hours of her shift with some easy back-and-forth deliveries, things like interoffice envelopes and electronic memos. It wasn't even all that rare late on a Friday afternoon for her to spend as much as thirty or forty minutes kneeling on a mailgirl mat waiting for her next summoning. But, she supposed she should stay positive; if she were to be asked to carry something heavy or awkward, at least she'd have company, apparently.<br>
<br>
And the fact that that company turned out to be Mailgirl Number Seven, already waiting for her in the empty conference room, immediately turned her whole afternoon around. Thirteen couldn't hide the smile that stretched from one ear to the other, as she hadn't seen her friend since this morning.<br>
<br>
Seven, too, smiled as Thirteen walked into the room. Her blonde hair was tied up in a bun that had begun to come apart, her body was covered in a light sheen of sweat, and her make-up looked a bit worse for the wear - all attesting to an afternoon that had likely been as challenging as Thirteen's own. She had an admittedly prominent nose, one that Master Hooper teased looked like a bird beak, but it complimented her face, and might even have gone unnoticed if she weren't surrounded by specimens as perfect and flawless as the other mailgirls. Her eyes were bright blue, and filled with life that even three months as a mailgirl hadn't been able to extinguish. And her smile, big and beaming, always made Thirteen melt inside.<br>
<br>
Thirteen was little confused as to what Miss Cochran expected of the two of them. There were two big boxes of copier paper on the conference table, sure, but Thirteen likely would have been able to carry both on her own. The fact that the copier paper was here in the conference room seemed odd, like it was staged. Never mind that the girls typically made these sorts of supply runs early in the morning, and they mostly involved hauling such supplies up from the basement to the higher level floors - not from one higher level floor to another. And then there was Seven, who was not in any of the standard mailgirl positions - Feet, Knees, Toes - but rather leaning casually, expectantly, up against the conference table in the center of the room.<br>
<br>
Whatever this was, Seven was in on it.<br>
<br>
The two girls had shared a romance, briefly, earlier in the summer. They'd never been a full-fledged couple, like Two and Three, but they'd been monogamous all the same for the better part of two weeks. Seven knew Thirteen's real name, and Thirteen knew Seven's (Michelle), which was an intimacy of sorts among mailgirls - even if they still continued to use each other's names while alone, even while in the privacy of Thirteen's apartment. And it had hurt when Thirteen had cut the relationship short, and hurt again when Seven had moved on to other girls.<br>
<br>
While the other girls in Thirteen's cohort, the girls who'd begun their contracts in June, had been assigned more experienced mailgirls to shadow, Thirteen had been given over to Mailgirl Number Seven - who had only become a mailgirl herself that last week of June. The previous Mailgirl Number Seven had managed to stick it out for three weeks, before running home to somewhere in upstate and refusing to return to the Plaza. Michelle Mayer, then still a rising corporate attorney within USF's Legal Department, was approached first thing that Monday morning; she found her supervisor, along with Will Barrow and Mistress Zero, waiting for her in her office. She knew what the meeting was before anyone had spoken a word. She knew that Human Capital had been sniffing around and she suspected she likely would have been recruited for the June class anyways. She'd been a part of the team that had drafted USF's version of the standard mailgirl contract earlier that spring, and knew full-well how ironclad and penalty-laden that contract truly was, that the Power of Attorney privileges the girls signed away made them one step short of being slavegirls instead of mailgirls. She also knew that being recruited was little more than a show - her choices were to sign away two years of her life, or pack up her things and seek employment elsewhere. There were plenty of times she'd regretted not choosing that latter option. But on that particular morning she had talked herself into it; she'd use her role as a mailgirl as a cash-grab to pay off her debts from law school, and to extract the promise of an unprecedented promotion on the other side of the contract. In May, two years from now, Seven would be the youngest Associate General Counsel at US Financial, a promotion she would earn by streaking through the halls and delivering the mail.<br>
<br>
And so Seven had been stripped and collared the Monday before Thirteen had arrived for the summer, and had taken her place among the other eleven mailgirls at that time - all before nine o'clock in the morning. When Thirteen had joined the team that next week, Mistress Zero believed that Seven was now experienced enough to show one of the new girls the ropes. Thirteen wondered if she might have felt as close a bond with whomever she'd been assigned to that first day - be it One, or Ten, or even Eight. But there was a spark between Thirteen and Seven that was difficult to deny, even three months later.<br>
<br>
Neither girl had even been with a woman before, though, and so that spark took a couple of weeks to truly catch fire.<br>
<br>
As mailgirls, they were all strictly forbidden from fraternizing with other USF employees, both in and out of the office. And it was difficult to maintain a real relationship with a boyfriend, given the sexual nature of what the girls were asked to on a daily basis. Or chose to do, such as masturbating in the locker room. Some of the girls continued to date, but it was mostly losers and perverts they never would have considered before. Or they strung together one night stands to scratch the itch their new life had brought out in them. The truth of it was, however, that the only other people who truly understood what it was like to be a mailgirl were other mailgirls themselves, and so it was pretty common for a girl's heterosexuality to be challenged over the course of her contract. There were a few happy and monogamous lesbian couples, like Two and Three. More common were the more short-term pairings-off in which one girl used another for a bit of cunnilingus or a quick finger-bang, and then was expected to return the favor.<br>
<br>
But there was also a middle-ground - not exactly full-on lesbian relationships, but more like friends with benefits. This is what Eleven had enjoyed with Eighteen before things soured, and this is how Thirteen would have characterized what she'd shared with Mailgirl Number Seven. They'd gone back to Thirteen's for drinks on a Wednesday after they'd been on Evening Shift together; two girls were selected every day, mostly at random, to wash the silver dog dishes, scrub the toilets, and clean and mop the locker room itself. On that particular Wednesday, neither Seven nor Thirteen had wanted to go home alone, and both knew full well what Thirteen's invitation back to her apartment really meant. They'd met eyes in the shower, while both attending to their own, respective sex drives, and that look had been enough to affirm a contract between the two of them that night - that they'd try something new, that they'd give this a whirl.<br>
<br>
For Thirteen, it was the best sex she'd ever had. Seven confessed the same. Both agreed that their heightened sexual state, owing from their exhibition and submission in their current, chosen occupation, most likely had something to do with the level of their arousal, the intensity of their respective climaxes, and the deep satisfaction that followed. But that didn't take away from the fact that sex was still good, still great. Or that both felt, with a little practice, it could get even better.<br>
<br>
Over the next couple of weeks, Thirteen went home by herself just once. More often than not, it was back to her sublet on the Upper West, but she made the trip out Seven's apartment in Brooklyn a few times - showing up back at the Plaza still dressed in the clothes she'd gone home in (but which she'd really only worn for the trips back and forth to the Plaza). Seven had joined her for her long, intense treadmill session in her building's basement on one of the Saturday mornings they were both off. And, on a Sunday afternoon, she'd even waited patiently - naked, in Thirteen's bed - as Thirteen worked on her research notes and had her weekly check-in call with her advisor, Gillian Schang.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, though, it was Gillian who pointed out the precarious position that Thirteen had put herself in with Seven. Thirteen's contract with USF would be up twenty-one months prior to Seven's; at some point, that was likely to become an issue for the other girl, likely to be a source of resentment. And, more importantly, Thirteen couldn't forget why she was running packages naked through the halls of USF Plaza in the first place - she was there to study the lives of the other mailgirls. Seven was a research subject, and Thirteen was in danger of losing her objectivity.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had sniffed at this last point; the entire reason she was in this situation was because Gillian had suggested she needed to experience the life of a mailgirl firsthand - subjectively. And, becoming a "letter-carrying lesbian" was a part of that life. But she conceded the argument, and understood where her professor was coming from. And so the following evening, over a late night dinner post-shift downtown, Thirteen bowed out of their so-called relationship as gracefully as she could.<br>
<br>
Seven was understanding. And, if she'd been hurt, she did a better job hiding it than Thirteen might have been capable of. It was Seven who, true to form, kept assuring Thirteen that she'd be okay, that they'd both be okay. And Thirteen had, in fact, been hurt when Seven moved on to Mailgirl Number Ten so soon thereafter, and then hurt again and feeling excluded when Seven and Ten's relationship morphed into something else that included Mailgirl Number Nineteen. And Mailgirl Number Seventeen that one time. And the new Mailgirl Number Twenty-Three, in only her first Friday night out the rest of the girls. Seven seemed to be signaling that it was the sex that was important to her. The Mother Hen role she played in the locker room allowed her the opportunity to connect with more than a few of the other girls.<br>
<br>
And, yet, here she was, on Thirteen's last day, waiting for her in an empty conference room on a half-empty floor. Whatever this was, whatever Miss Cochran's involvement happened to be, Thirteen knew instantly that it was Seven who'd arranged it.<br>
<br>
"Hi," Seven smiled at her friend.<br>
<br>
"Hi," Thirteen said back.<br>
<br>
Thirteen hesitated, and so it was Seven who spoke up again. "We've only got ten minutes. One of my old colleagues was willing to lend Miss Cochran a few chits on our behalf."<br>
<br>
Thirteen, of course, knew exactly what Seven meant. But she was still unsure of herself, and scared witless over being caught.<br>
<br>
Seven sensed that fear, and assured her, "Miss Cochran is going to play lookout." She stepped closer to Thirteen, and took her hands in her own. Behind Thirteen, the diminutive accountant closed the conference room door almost all the way, and took up position there, still inside the room. It occurred to Thirteen that, in exchange for Miss Cochran's confidence, she'd be performing in front of an audience.<br>
<br>
Thirteen shrugged the thought off. It didn't matter. She'd performed in front of larger audiences, on her own, in the locker room.<br>
<br>
Instead, she leaned in, and kissed the other naked blonde.<br>
<br>
Their bare skin touched, and Thirteen felt a spark of electricity as her nipple rubbed up against Seven's own bare breast. Seven's hands found a hold of Thirteen's left hip. Then the back of her head, and pulled her closer. Thirteen's own hands didn't waste any more time, and moved to embrace the other girl.<br>
<br>
"Why?" Thirteen panted between kisses. Why was she doing this? Why was she risking Mistress Zero's wrath?<br>
<br>
"Because," Seven answered, her own breathing labored, as well, "I wanted to send you off right."<br>
<br>
Seven pushed Thirteen back, and turned her, so that now it was Thirteen's bare behind that was leaning up against the conference table. Over Seven's shoulder, Thirteen saw that Miss Cochran was watching intensely from her vantage point by the door. But Thirteen chose to ignore her - this wasn't about her.<br>
<br>
"But, we still have tonight," Thirteen said a few moments later, coming up for air once more.<br>
<br>
Seven pushed her backwards, so that Thirteen was now seated on the table, her legs dangling and spread around Seven's own naked body. "You're still welcome to come up to the room with us tonight," she answered, and the "us" was enough to spur on Thirteen's curiosity and libido. "And after what I'm about to do for you, I expect to you to."<br>
<br>
And with that, Seven's head was between Thirteen's legs.<br>
<br>
They were working against the clock, and so there was no more time for flirting or foreplay. And, truth be told, Thirteen knew she didn't need any foreplay to "get into the mood;" she flitted about the building in a constant and unrelenting state of arousal. Seven was of course well aware of this fact, as it was an arousal that she, too, dealt with on a daily basis, an arousal that all of the girls could confess to. Even as Seven used her right hand to grab purchase of Thirteen's left buttock and pull Thirteen's pussy close and tight against her face, her left was between her own legs, moving furiously back and forth. This may have been a parting gift for Thirteen, but it was apparently one that Seven was going to enjoy, as well.<br>
<br>
"You taste like cherry," Seven offered, her voice muffled. It wasn't a question, exactly, so much as an observation.<br>
<br>
Seven was on her knees, with her legs spread, and one of the conference table's chairs pushed aside. Thirteen, meanwhile, had her legs draped over her friend's shoulders, and was squeezing the other girl's face between her thighs. She leaned back, using her left hand to steady herself against the table, and her right to pull the girl's head closer into her. She ran her finger's through Seven's hair, not pulling out her bun, but pulling her hair just so, in a way she knew turned Seven on.<br>
<br>
Her eyes were closed, in ecstasy, and she concentrated on the waves of pleasure emanating from deep inside her. Seven's tongue was a berserker on a battlefield - working this way and that, running circles around her clit, and then piercing deep inside her folds. Thirteen let loose a low, guttural moan - loud enough to let Seven and Miss Cochran know what sort of effect Seven's mouth was having on her, but soft enough that it wouldn't carry out beyond the room.<br>
<br>
"Oh, yes," Thirteen squeaked. "Yes, yes, yes, yes!"<br>
<br>
Thirteen had had a one-night stand with a man she'd met at the Imperial, in the aftermath of her brief relationship with Seven. It had started off well, and began hotter and more pleasurable than any intercourse she'd ever shared with Christopher, Brad, Luke, or Mark. But her partner hadn't had the stamina to keep up. He'd gotten her off the first time, but then she'd been forced to take care of herself after that, while he watched on limply. She'd been on her own since then, and though she'd gotten quite skilled at being on her own, her fingers simply couldn't rival Seven's tongue. And the fact that it was here, at the Plaza, while still on duty, only heightened just how turned on that Thirteen was. The fact that it was naughty and forbidden excited her that much more.<br>
<br>
She wished she had more time, to luxuriate in the sensations of Seven's mouth on her pussy. But time was never on a mailgirl's side. It was something that Seven seemed to be aware of, as well; she'd gotten quite practiced at eating another girl out over her time with Thirteen, and had apparently been perfecting her technique with the other girls since then. Even if Thirteen had wanted her to linger, had wanted her to tease, had wanted her to take her time, she doubted that Seven would have let her put off her climax if she tried. It hit her hard, fast, and intense - without a build-up so much as an explosion. Thirteen felt her whole body seize up, the orgasm wrapping its fingers around her spine and refusing to let go.<br>
<br>
She gasped for air, opened her eyes - and met Miss Cochran's gaze. The girls' fully-dressed monitor was watching them hungrily. Thirteen doubted she'd been keeping much of a lookout. She was flushed, and biting her lower lip. And though she hadn't resorted to touching herself, too, Thirteen knew that look, and knew that Miss Cochran was desperate to, nonetheless. She'd helped Seven spring this surprise upon Thirteen not out of the kindness of her heart, but specifically for this, specifically for the opportunity to play voyeur, specifically to watch the show that Thirteen was putting on.<br>
<br>
Thirteen didn't disappoint. It was Seven between her legs, but it was Miss Cochran with whom Thirteen shared the orgasm. A mailgirl was never to make eye contact, unless told to do so; they were mandated to stare blankly, submissively, at the floor. This eye contact - here, now, with Miss Cochran - was therefore that much more deep and powerful, that much more of a no-no. And it made Thirteen's orgasm that much more heightened and all-consuming as a consequence.<br>
<br>
In three months, the only orgasm that Thirteen could even compare it to was her first, at home, after her first day at the Plaza. Maybe the second, the following day, in the locker room? Even her first with Seven, as drunk on lust and arousal as they'd been, couldn't rival this; as good as it had felt at the time, neither Seven nor Thirteen had entirely known what they were doing. That was no longer the case. Seven was now a pussy-eating savant. And Thirteen, over the course of the summer, had learned a thing or two about submitting herself to another, handing herself over to someone's else control. She thought about Six, and about Six's confession that she now found it difficult to relieve herself without an audience; without question, this orgasm's intensity owed almost as much to Miss Cochran's presence as it did to Seven herself. Thirteen, even in the midst of such a climax, fretted that she'd never again be able to cum like she'd cum as a mailgirl.<br>
<br>
The sound, emanating from deep within Thirteen and escaping into the conference, spoke volumes. It wasn't a shriek or a squeal or a yip. It wasn't for show. It was loud enough that she should have been worried abut it attracting attention for those members of Finance & Accounting still at their desks. But Thirteen had lost all semblance of control. She felt Seven begin to pull back, the muffled sounds of pleasure signaling that she'd reached her own climax, but Thirteen refused to release the other naked blonde. Instead, she held her friend's head in place forcefully, with strength and dominance that surprised even her, and continued to grind her wet, sopping pussy against Seven's mouth. With all the depth of a baritone (bass?), Thirteen sang out one, final series of, "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oooooh!!"<br>
<br>
Seven's own orgasm had come and gone, but Thirteen continued to hold tight to the other girl's hair, continued to press forcefully up against the other's girl's face, and rode out the aftershocks of her climax. She worked hard to catch her breath, and it was only the vibration of the smartphone on her arm that signaled her time was up.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry," Miss Cochran squeaked. Even at that moment, it seemed absurd to Thirteen that anyone would apologize to a mailgirl. "I just, I just don't have any more chits."<br>
<br>
Thirteen looked at her blankly, her chest continuing to heave. She let go of Seven's hair.<br>
<br>
"I just, I just, I just didn't need those boxes to actually to go anywhere," Miss Cochran continued to stammer. "So I marked it as a pick-up and drop-off. Someone else must be calling you."<br>
<br>
How could that have been ten minutes? How was she going to be able to pick herself up and go on to her next delivery from here? She was entirely weak in the knees, and she doubted she'd even be able to stand.<br>
<br>
It was Seven who got up first, and then crossed the room to the accountant. She took Miss Cochran's hands in her own, and then leaned down for a kiss. Her hands were sure to be covered in her own juices, and she had to taste of Thirteen's. But Miss Cochran didn't hesitate or object - she leaned into the kiss, and accepted it as the "thank you" that it was.<br>
<br>
"It's okay," Seven answered calmly, and then turned back to Thirteen. "I think we're good."<br>
<br>
Thirteen, recognizing that she'd left a puddle of sweat on the conference table, peeled her bare skin from the lacquer and stepped to the floor. She had to steady herself against on the unused chair, and knew then and there she'd likely be getting a demerit or two or three on her next pick-up. But, as she looked down at the smartphone on her arm, her back stiffened. Being late wasn't going to be an option - she was being summoned to Human Capital, to Will Barrow's office, up on the 18th Floor.<br>
<br>
She didn't need to say anything to Seven - not a thank you, not an expression of love. Seven knew. The look between them was enough.<br>
<br>
Seven was still holding one of Miss Cochran's hands as Thirteen dashed past them. If anyone outside the conference room had heard her, they didn't pop their heads up to show themselves, or to confirm who'd just hit a full-throated orgasm in the middle of Finance & Accounting.<br>
<br>
"You still owe me," Seven called out teasingly from behind her.<br>
<br>
"Tonight," Thirteen called back, hitting a good clip on her way to the stairwell, and feeling her breasts bounce with each footfall.<br>
<br>
But, as it turned out, this was a debt that Thirteen would be forced to wait some time to settle.

Mailgirl Number Thirteen stunk of sweat and pussy as she bounded up the stairs towards the 18th Floor. If she were to be called upon for an inspection, she'd most likely fail, and be sent back down to the Mailgirls Locker Room on the 2nd Floor for a shower, a reapplication of deodorant from the mailgirls' communal stash, and a quick mist of cheap, floral-scented perfume. Such failures were fairly rare, though. As much as employees at US Financial Plaza enjoyed torturing the girls by getting them up on their toes and subjecting them to the embarrassment of the inspection itself, girls had to be a pretty fine mess for them be sent off to Mistress Zero.<br>
<br>
Thirteen worried she was on the wrong side of that line now. And the fact that she was being called to Human Capital, the department responsible for the operations of the mailgirl program overall, made the likelihood of a failed inspection that much more of a reality.<br>
<br>
Will Barrow, the group's director, had been an undergraduate at Yale once upon a time, and he'd studied under Professor Gillian Schang, Thirteen's faculty advisor, while there. It was Barrow's presence that had assured both Thirteen and Gillian that the program wouldn't descend into the full-blown sexual slavery that had enveloped mailgirl programs elsewhere, and it why Gillian had chosen to send Thirteen to USF. Sure, they might tiptoe up to that line; just that day, Thirteen had been forced to insert a lollipop inside of herself, and been threatened by an unzipped fly. But Barrow managed to keep the program running without turning the girls into whores and sex-bots, and Thirteen was truly and honestly thankful for that. She knew that he continued to talk regularly with Gillian. And that, as condescending as it came off, Gillian received regular updates on Thirteen's performance directly from Barrow - in addition to the Sunday afternoon calls between Gillian and Thirteen to discuss her research.<br>
<br>
And so, Thirteen worried about showing up at Barrow's door in the state she was in now. She was naked from head to toe, save for a metal collar with a #13 dog tag and a lycra armband around her left bicep. Her long blonde hair was done up in ponytails, at the request of her direct supervisor - Mistress Zero - that morning, though she suspected that they were a bit worse for wear, and had begun to come out. But it wasn't the nudity that worried her; it was embarrassing, for sure, but it was an embarrassment she'd gotten used to over the course of the summer - racing from one corner of USF to the other in nothing but her birthday suit, rushing packages and envelopes and electronic memos up flights of stairs and down the service elevators.<br>
<br>
No, rather, it was that she stunk of sex, and she feared Barrow would smell it on her.<br>
<br>
The mailgirls delightfully referred it to as "getting salty," a phrase that managed to capture the peculiar and particular funk of sweat, body odor, cheap perfume, and pussy. They were all physically active throughout the day, and run to their absolute limits with delivery deadlines that were just on this side of being utterly impossible. Thirteen had never been in as good shape as she was now, after three months of being a mailgirl, after three months of being forced to climb ten, twelve, fifteen flights of stairs at a time, forced to run at a full clip down corridors and through cubicles higher up in the building. But it meant working up a sweat, and so it wasn't unusual for her to shower five or six times a day - often just a quick rinse, but enough to make sure that her "uniform" was clean and inoffensive. As for the smell of pussy? Even the girls who refused to act upon their baser impulses could still admit that the exhibitionist nature of their current occupation was something of a turn-on. Others, such as Thirteen, recognized it was less the nudity itself that was the turn-on, but the submission. One or the other, Thirteen spent a good portion of her day wet and aroused, and so the cold showers in the locker room were not solely to combat sweat.<br>
<br>
The arousal was undeniable, and acting upon it was inescapable. There were mailgirl programs elsewhere in the world for whom masturbation was strictly, strictly forbidden. When Barrow had set up the program at USF, he'd studied best practices from other companies, and found that no program was truly successful at stomping out masturbation altogether. Even in those programs where it was forbidden, the girls still snuck off and got themselves off regularly - consequences, punishments, and demerits be damned. At USF, the girls were given the allowance of being able to touch themselves in the locker room while on break. It wasn't private, exactly, as the locker room had a sheet of mirror glass that exposed such activity to the elevator lobby beyond. But it was contained, and the show the girls put on at lunch regularly gathered an adoring and laughing, cheering crowd.<br>
<br>
Masturbation inside the locker room was not a punishable offense, but actual sex was entirely off limits anywhere in the building. Fraternization with non-mailgirl employees at USF was entirely prohibited. And even in those cases where a mailgirl had struck up a relationship with another mailgirl - an entirely common phenomenon - it was forbidden for the girls to sleep with one another at the Plaza.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had not only just gotten off in a conference room down in Finance & Accounting, but she'd done so through the courtesy of Mailgirl Number Seven's mouth, while another woman had looked on. And, while still in the throes of that particular orgasm, she'd been summoned up to Will Barrow's office on the 18th Floor.<br>
<br>
She knew she was a mess. And as unacceptable as missing a deadline for the Director of Human Capital may have been, she couldn't show up in the state she was still in. Her skin was still flushed, her inner thighs still coated with a combination of pussy juice and saliva, and her body sweatier than a five story climb could explain. And so, as she arrived in Human Resources, she didn't go directly to Barrow's office, but instead took the longer route out around the reception desk by the elevators.<br>
<br>
The smartphone on her arm would log the irregularity, and a deviation between Point A and Point B would be flagged by one Barrow's analysts for review. But, glancing at the timer that continued to tick down, she saw that she had a few extra seconds to spare. And the reality was that Thirteen had less than two hours, less than 120 minutes, before her contract with USF expired.<br>
<br>
Thirteen found the reception desk empty, as she expected it to be. It was after five o'clock on a Friday. And while plenty of the other floors were still abuzz with activity, support functions like HR and Accounting and IT tended to empty out a bit earlier. And so there was no audience as Thirteen hustled to the mailgirl mat by the elevator. The mat was thin and pink, stamped with the USF logo, and was where the girls were expected to wait - on their knees, of course - in between deliveries. More important at that moment was the silver dog dish beside the mat, a water bowl the girls were allowed to drink from. Thankfully, it was full; the employees in Human Resources tended to be kinder about refilling the bowl than other departments. Between the empty lobby and the full dog dish, Thirteen felt that - for once - things were working out in her favor.<br>
<br>
She wasted no time. She crouched down on the mat, reached into the bowl, and then splashed herself with water, handful after handful. She paid particular attention to her pits, as well as to her crotch - where the aftershocks of her orgasm continued to reverberate minutes later. It wasn't the same as taking a shower, of course, but it would wash the worst of her guilt away. She didn't have a towel, and instead used her hands to dry herself off as best she could. She left a puddle behind her on the mailgirl mat, but it wasn't the first puddle she'd ever left behind. It was only water. It would dry.<br>
<br>
It would have to do. Thirteen stood, and then took off at a full sprint towards Barrow's office. Employee Relations, Employee Benefits, Payroll - they all had their homes here on the 18th Floor, but Human Capital was off in one corner, down a long hallway and separate from the rest of HR. Thirteen had wondered if this was by design, if the cruelty and abuse the department inflicted upon the mailgirls would have been too much for the rest of HR to stand. Or, maybe, it was just where the open offices had happened to be when USF launched its own mailgirls program that spring.<br>
<br>
Thirteen didn't have much time to take in the "artwork" that hung on the corridor's walls, but it teased her all the same. In the few times she'd been called to Human Capital, she'd hated having to parade past the department's trophies, and she was grateful that, at the moment, she could rush through them with her head down. They surrounded her on all sides, reminders of the humiliation that USF had inflicted upon twenty-seven of its own employees, and one particular graduate student looking to experience life among the mailgirls firsthand.<br>
<br>
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. And Six. Another Two. Another Four. The original Number Seven. Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, and another Seven. And so on. Each girl had a frame designated just for her. And while, yes, each frame contained a picture of that girl "in uniform" (naked, and in "Knees" position), those pictures were relatively small, and took up only a corner of the frame to the bottom left. Proudly on display instead, like the hunting trophies they were, were the panties each of the "volunteers" had happened to be wearing on the day they were approached and became mailgirls.<br>
<br>
There were other programs - successful programs - that gave candidates a night or two, or a week, to decide whether or not they wanted to actually become mailgirls. There was the same amount of pressure and coercion involved, the same amount of threatening and blackmail, but girls were given a certain amount of time to roll the proposal in front of them over in their minds, to examine it from every angle, to work through whether they'd be able to escape a program director's clutches. More common, however, was that a girl was approached with a contract, asked to decide on the spot, and then stripped naked right then and there, before the ink of her signature had a chance to dry. USF had taken this latter route. At the start of April, on the same day the program was announced here at the Plaza, Barrow had made his rounds with Mistress Zero. By mid-morning Mailgirls Number One through Six had been recruited, asked to undress, and chained up on display.<br>
<br>
Thirteen believed this route to be the kinder one; given how much advance notice she'd had, because of her particular situation, she'd lost nights of sleep, had her stomach tied up in knots for weeks, and felt the fear and dread slowly overtake her as June approached. Better to have the bandage ripped off quickly and get the whole thing over with.<br>
<br>
But despite the fact that they'd been surprised, and hadn't seen the trophy hunt coming, Thirteen had to admit that the first cohort of mailgirls represented themselves well. Mailgirl Number One had apparently been wearing a lace g-string. The first Mailgirl Number Two had been in a pair of bikini briefs. For Three, it was hip-huggers. If Thirteen hadn't been among the girls whose underwear was hung proudly in the hallway, she might have viewed it as an intriguing socio-anthropological study: what did the up-and-coming young women of Wall Street wear beneath their power suits? Of that first group, it was only the original Number Four who really and truly had anything to be embarrassed over; the high-waist white cotton briefs that still hung in Human Capital looked as if they'd been worn and laundered a few too many times.<br>
<br>
The next expansion of the program occurred at the beginning of May, and Seven - who'd been on the legal team that had drafted USF's version of the standard mailgirl contract - had suspected that she might be tapped. She didn't know about the wall of trophies; that news had yet to begin circulating throughout the building. But she feared she might be called upon to strip in front of an audience, and had therefore that morning donned the sexiest pair of sheer panties she owned. She'd been relieved when Barrow hadn't come for her that day (but also, weirdly stung). But he and Mistress Zero had eventually sought her out when the original Number Seven went AWOL. By dumb luck, she'd happened to be wearing a red lace tanga at the time, and Thirteen smiled as she passed her friend's contribution to the wall now.<br>
<br>
Word of the rite had begun to spread by the time Barrow began putting together the June class, and the girls all joked that three quarters of the female staff at USF had likely spent more time picking out their underwear that day than any day prior. Thirteen, though, knew nothing of it. But she'd still gotten dressed that first morning in June with the expectation she'd be undressing in public. Above her naked portrait, in the frame designated as Mailgirl Number Thirteen, was a pearl white lace thong she'd purchased for the occasion, one that she'd worn just that once. She hadn't intended to bequeath it to USF, but it hung here nonetheless; she'd gone home that first night with a draft wafting up her skirt.<br>
<br>
Fourteen's frame, across from her own, was empty. Even prior to becoming a mailgirl, Fourteen had apparently never been a big believer in underwear, wearing them only when she truly needed to.<br>
<br>
All in the all - and Fourteen's frame notwithstanding - the corridor to Human Capital felt like an advertisement for Victoria's Secret. Thirteen wasn't sure how the company would feel about that fact - it was an undoubtedly sexy gauntlet, but they'd apparently lost more than a few good and loyal customers to the stark naked uniforms of mailgirls.<br>
<br>
Which wasn't exactly true. Gillian had received a sizeable research grant to spend as she wished, and she'd turned it over to Thirteen. The sublet on the Upper West Side was entirely paid for, and nicer than Thirteen had had right to expect. She spent freely on food and entertainment - actually having to cook dinner for herself again, once she returned to her graduate housing in New Haven, would be an adjustment. And an embarrassingly large sum of money had, in fact, been spent at Victoria's Secret, as Thirteen dipped more and more into her stipend to buy clothes to wear solely on the commute to and from the Plaza. She needed to fit in among the mailgirls who were dressing up and dressing sexily for the only times of the day they'd actually be allowed to wear clothes. In retrospect, it might have been cheaper to follow One's lead, and wear nothing but a short, summer-weight trench coat in and out of the office.<br>
<br>
Thirteen pushed through the door and into Human Capital, leaving the Hall of Panties behind her. She felt the smartphone vibrate on her arm, and she knew she was late; she'd picked up another demerit.<br>
<br>
The Human Capital team, within the larger Human Resources department, was made up of just Will Barrow, his secretary, a group of four analysts who pored over the mounds of data collected by the smartphones, and two technicians who knew the smartphones themselves inside and out. And yet their suite on the southwest corner of the 18th floor was nicer than anything Thirteen had seen in ER or Payroll. It was unlikely that the offices had been vacant when Human Capital came online; more likely, it was that another group had been bumped and asked to vacate ahead of Barrow and his staff. Private offices for every member of the team, complete with windows, orbited around a glass-encased conference room in the center. They had their own private kitchen, their own private restroom (a men's room, at least; Barrow's secretary still had use the ladies' room by the elevators with the rest of HR), and even their own private break room. The break room, Thirteen saw, now had a new pool table to go along with the couch, the big screen TV, and the arcade games; Barrow's team had apparently been well-recognized by the higher ups for their contribution's the company's bottom line.<br>
<br>
Thirteen reached Barrow's corner office, and saw that his secretary had apparently already gone home for the weekend. She passed the girl's desk, and knocked lightly on the door.<br>
<br>
"Come," Barrow shouted from the far side, and Thirteen stepped into the room.<br>
<br>
Barrow wasn't alone in his office, but he was the only one seated. To one side were two stark naked girls, on their knees and facing the window to the city beyond. Neither had much of view, however; they were both hooded and restrained, their wrists handcuffed behind them. Thirteen had been treated to the hood more than once over the course of the summer, and she suspected they were both more than likely gagged, as well. With the hoods on, Thirteen couldn't tell who they were. But Thirteen was now quite capable of recognizing the naked bodies of her fellow mailgirls, even from behind, and neither girl was currently on USF's roster. One of them, the girl on the left, seemed oddly familiar nonetheless, but Thirteen didn't think much more of it; it may just have been an ass that, fully clothed, had caught her attention somewhere in the building in one of her less-than-heterosexual moments of arousal. Maybe it was that she was still reeling from the lesbian orgasm she'd had only a few minutes earlier, but there was a part of her even now that wanted to touch it, squeeze it, bite it.<br>
<br>
Also in the room was Mistress Zero, who was pacing back and forth like an animal in a zoo, and Thirteen couldn't help but like prey being sized up by a predator. The German woman had been a mailgirl herself for a comparable financial firm back in Frankfurt, but any level of empathy she had for the girls under her watch now wasn't readily apparent. She had dark brown hair that was done up in a meticulous bun, and high, angular cheekbones that seemed to speak to the severity of her personality. She was dressed, as she had been since that morning, in a dark designer suit that was maybe one part high-end businesswear and one part corporate dominatrix. In fact, "dominatrix" may have been a better way to describe what Mistress's duties were on a day-to-day basis than whatever actual title Human Capital had bestowed upon her. Thirteen's bare ass still stung a bit from the attention Mistress Zero's paddle had given it over lunch.<br>
<br>
But Mistress Zero wasn't done with Thirteen's ass quite yet. "That's twenty-five," she admonished in her thick German accent. "Twenty-four in a single afternoon."<br>
<br>
Thirteen cursed to herself, regretting the quick whore's bath she'd taken in the dog dish by the elevators. The real fault lay at the feet of Kim Kinney in Investment Banking. Thirteen had been at plus-one going into the afternoon, and had admittedly earned four more entirely on her own (including just now). But bulk of her afternoon's total had come at the hand of the dark-haired girl on the 41st Floor. She'd forced Thirteen into a cheerleader's outfit from her alma mater, and then coerced her into inserting a cherry lollipop inside of her, all while doling out demerits for every moment of hesitation from the naked blonde. This was Kim's fault, and Thirteen could do nothing more than wish Kim was here now - on the receiving end of an imaginary paddle in Thirteen's grip.<br>
<br>
"I mean, given the circumstances," Barrow began in Mistress Zero's direction, before trailing off.<br>
<br>
"A demerit is a demerit, sir." This from a short-ish Asian woman on the far side of the room. Given the two naked girls and the imposing presence of her mistress, Thirteen had barely registered her as she'd entered Barrow's office. She was standing in the standard mailgirls' "Feet" position - legs parted and feet a bit more than shoulder-length apart, with her arms behind and her chest prominently thrust forward. She was fully dressed, however, and apparently shared Mistress Zero's fashion sense, right down to the dangerous-looking heels that helped with her height. She, too, spoke with an accent, one that Thirteen guessed was Japanese. And, given her posture, Thirteen suspect that she was another former mailgirl, one whose purpose here today wasn't entirely clear.<br>
<br>
No introductions were made. A mailgirl like Thirteen didn't merit introductions.<br>
<br>
But Thirteen's attention was pulled from the mystery woman back to Barrow, as he spoke into the speaker phone on his desk. "Your thoughts, Doctor Schang?"<br>
<br>
Thirteen was now even more confused. What was Gillian doing on the other end of the phone?<br>
<br>
And, if Thirteen had expected her advisor to come to her rescue now, she was immediately disappointed. From the phone: "She's still yours."<br>
<br>
Still his, Thirteen reacted bitterly. At least until seven.<br>
<br>
Barrow met Mistress Zero's eyes, moved on to the Japanese woman, and then on to Thirteen herself. "A demerit is a demerit," he repeated, shrugging as if he had no control over the matter.<br>
<br>
Thirteen swallowed hard. She'd hoped that the session over lunch had been her last. She wasn't, as it turned out, going to be able to escape so cleanly.<br>
<br>
It was Mistress Zero who'd been tasked with the more routine oversight of USF's mailgirls - she was the disciplinarian, the enforcer, the tormentor. But it was Barrow to whom she reported, and Barrow who pulled her strings. Thirteen's mistress was every bit a part of the "mailgirl show" here at the Plaza as the mailgirls themselves. And it wouldn't have surprised Thirteen that, behind closed doors, Barrow owned Mistress Zero every bit as much as Mistress Zero owned Thirteen. But the cruel architect behind USF's mailgirl program gave none of that power or perversion away - he came across as kind, friendly, and easy-going. He was attractive - tall, dark hair, well-built - and still quite young, maybe mid-to-late thirties. He was intelligent, too; a Yale undergraduate and a Yale MBA, he always managed to come off as the smartest person in the room, but without rubbing anyone's nose in it. He'd apparently found his way into HR via a circuitous route through operations and logistics, which had somehow led to talent management and employee engagement. It had been a member of USF's senior management team who'd first proposed the idea of looking into mailgirls here at the Plaza, but it had been Barrow who'd been tapped to run with it.<br>
<br>
Thirteen was attracted to him, despite herself. Even leaving his looks out of the equation, it was the power and confidence she was drawn to.<br>
<br>
"Up against the desk," Mistress Zero instructed. "Turn around. Palms down."<br>
<br>
It caught Thirteen off guard, but she complied. It wasn't the first time she'd received punishment outside of the locker room; that honor belonged to a session with Mistress Zero's riding crop in the office of one of the EVP's up on the 47th Floor. But it was still rare, and Thirteen found herself humiliated all over again at the idea that Gillian would hear the entire thing transpire from the other end of phone line.<br>
<br>
"She's still yours," Gillian had offered in Thirteen's defense. Thirteen couldn't help but feel angry at and betrayed by the older woman. It was because of Gillian that Thirteen was a mailgirl in the first place. She'd done her best to beg out of it, to convince her advisor that she was capable of doing the research into the lives of mailgirls without actually having to be a mailgirl herself, to keep from suffering the embarrassment and debasement she'd been subjected to that summer. But Gillian had insisted that in order to understand what it meant to be a mailgirl, in order to make a name for herself in this particular field of research, Thirteen had to live among the mailgirls as a mailgirl. She'd gone so far as to threaten Thirteen with the idea of finishing her studies under Guy Dubuc, instead, and had begun fishing around among first- and second-year female grad students for other potential candidates. But Thirteen had caved, as she'd come to New Haven to study with Gillian, and she recognized that the research she was doing had the potential to catapult her into a faculty position at a top tier national university. And, with her summer of humiliations nearly over, Thirteen was willing to concede Gillian's point; she never would have truly comprehended the life of a mailgirl through interviews and observations alone. Even now, and even after everything she'd been through, she wasn't entirely sure that the short-term nature of her own contract put her in the same mindset of girls like Seven, or Fourteen, or Ten - girls who wouldn't be free for their own contracts until another full year after Thirteen had been award her PhD the following spring.<br>
<br>
"She's still yours," Gillian had offered. And Thirteen was still his, at least for a little while longer.<br>
<br>
It was a point that Mistress Zero recognized. "Would you like to do the honors?" The question was directed at Barrow.<br>
<br>
The man seemed to contemplate the offer for a moment, and Thirteen found herself hoping he might accept. She couldn't help it. The thought of Barrow spanking her turned her on.<br>
<br>
But, he declined politely, and instead ceded the opportunity to the stranger in their midst. "I think we should let our new mistress handle this," he answered. "Mistress Rei?"<br>
<br>
"Our new mistress," Barrow had called her. Thirteen wondered if the situation with Twenty-One a few weeks earlier had necessitated another set of eyes, another overseer, another mistress. Thirteen didn't envy the girls remaining behind at the Plaza.<br>
<br>
Given the situation she now found herself in, as Mistress Rei rained down the first of a series of open-handed spanks, Thirteen wondered who should be sympathizing with whom. The Japanese woman was behind her, slightly to her left, and delivering the punishment with a strength and ferocity that belied her small size. It didn't sting quite so much as the paddle had earlier that afternoon, or as the riding crop had a tendency to. But Mistress Rei's palm stung all the same, and it felt more painful than anything Thirteen had experienced from Mistress Zero's bare hand. And it didn't help that being punished by someone new felt like an entirely new humiliation.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had only just experienced one of the best orgasms she'd had all summer, courtesy of Seven's tongue on the 13th Floor. And yet she was already wet again, and could feel her arousal return with each spank she received from Mistress Rei. She felt broken, and damaged, that this was turning her on. And that Barrow's presence just a few feet away, on the far side of the desk, only heightened that arousal. They'd done this to her. He'd done this to her. She was a whore. She was a slut. She was some sort of twisted nymphomaniac. The nudity, the abuse, and the company's "allowance" of masturbation in the locker room (not to mention the acceptance and encouragement of the other girls) had transformed her, and turned her into some sort of depraved and corrupted deviant.<br>
<br>
Or maybe this was who she'd been all along, and it had taken the day-to-day life as a mailgirl to let it loose?<br>
<br>
Thirteen had long suspected it was more the latter, and she couldn't blame Barrow and USF for how she and the other girls had reacted when placed in their current roles. But the whimper and inadvertent whine from one of the girls by the window demonstrated that these two had yet to make that self-realization, and that at least one of them was suffering Thirteen's punishment perhaps more than Thirteen was.<br>
<br>
She winced as Mistress Rei landed another smack, and the sound of bare skin against bare skin echoed off the drywall.<br>
<br>
Her eyes were cast down upon the desk, but she could feel Barrow's close proximity nonetheless. She could hear the excitement in his breathing, the way he seemed to hold his breath just before Mistress Rei spanked her again. She had hoped it might have been him delivering this final punishment, but his presence was still very much felt, regardless. They were all a part of this ritual - Barrow, Mistress Zero, the two naked and hooded girls on their knees; it wasn't just Mistress Rei who had Thirteen excited in a complicated mish-mash of pleasure and pain. She was a naked mailgirl, whose purpose was to titillate and arouse, to inspire feelings of superiority and dominance. And the very fact that this was apparently affecting Barrow served as a feedback loop to Thirteen's own lust.<br>
<br>
By the time the Japanese woman finished, Thirteen's whole body was abuzz and alive. She had longed for more time with Seven, to pursue a second (third? fourth? fifth?) climax. And, perhaps if she'd had that time and hit that climax, she might not have felt the carnal need she felt at that moment. Or, maybe it was the other way around? Maybe it was her session with Seven, and the fact that she'd been called into Barrow's office still in the afterglow of that intense and enormous orgasm, that had made this arousal now inevitable?<br>
<br>
Mistress Rei had taken a step back, but Thirteen was still propped up against Barrow's desk, recovering. Barrow, for his part, seemed to be able to read her mind. "Do you want a moment or two? To..." He trailed off again, and Thirteen fought off the annoyance that he couldn't come right out and say it.<br>
<br>
"No," she exhaled. Correcting herself, she said, "No, sir."<br>
<br>
"Are you sure?"<br>
<br>
He was Lucifer, handing her an apple. Of course she wanted to touch herself. Of course she now wanted to get off once again. But despite evidence to the contrary, she wasn't an animal with no self control - she could make it to the end of her shift.<br>
<br>
Unless this wasn't an offer? Unless this was an instruction?<br>
<br>
Barrow leaned closer to his phone, and seemed to underline that this wasn't entirely Thirteen's choice. To Gillian, he asked, "You have a few moments to wait, don't you, Dr. Schang? For our girl here to find some release and compose herself?"<br>
<br>
"Of course," Gillian's voice rose into the room. "I think it'll help clear her head."<br>
<br>
Traitor, Thirteen seethed. She didn't need, need to touch herself now, but she could admit that she wanted to. And her tenuous grasp on composure and self-control didn't need to be tempted and teased like this. But she chose to accept Barrow's offer for what it was, as an order. But, as an order that a good part of her was thankful for.<br>
<br>
"Okay," she sighed. "Yes, please. Yes, please, sir."<br>
<br>
"Good," Barrow clapped. Gesturing to the center of the room, he added, "Just not on my desk."<br>
<br>
Thirteen turned, and caught eye contract from Mistress Zero. The dark-haired woman jutted her chin towards the carpet, and said simply, "The floor." There was no judgment in her voice. For once, maybe Mistress Zero was letting her own past bleed through - maybe Thirteen didn't need this, but there was little doubt she'd get off on it nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Just get through this, Thirteen told herself. Get there. Get off. Get on the other side of this. No need to linger, no need to hesitate. It wouldn't take long.<br>
<br>
She got onto all fours, and then dropped her forehead to the rug. She propped herself up with her left arm, her entire forearm resting on the floor beneath her, and reached between her legs with her right.<br>
<br>
She heard a single sob from one of the two girls by the window, and it struck Thirteen once more how familiar she seemed. Mailgirls didn't cry - Seven had taught her that - and as much as this new girl now tried to control it, it was a lesson she'd need to learn better.<br>
<br>
Her buttocks still stung from the abuse Mistress Rei had bequeathed upon them, and she wondered how many little red handprints now speckled her ass. As with the spanking, Mistress Rei, Mistress Zero, Barrow, Gillian, and the two naked girls were all just as much a part of this now as Thirteen was. She was touching herself, she was fingering herself, she was rubbing herself. But it was their presence and passive participation that made this much more than Thirteen masturbating alone.<br>
<br>
She was out-of-breath, and she gasped for air. She was working furiously, violently, upon herself. Her middle and ring fingers were buried inside of her, and she used the butt of her palm to grind against her clit. The quick rinse she'd given herself by the elevators was now all for naught - she was wet and warm from the inside out, and sweating once more. As her head bounced back and forth along the carpet, one of her pigtails finally gave up the good fight, and fell loose. And, entirely out of control, she let forth a low, bleating moan that carried all the way to Gillian's office in New Haven.<br>
<br>
Behind the desk, Barrow now stood, and joined the rest of Thirteen's audience for a better vantage point. He'd undoubtedly seen her do this before, but from a distance - through the mirror glass on the 2nd Floor, or over one of the closed circuit cameras that were constantly spying upon the girls. He stood above and beside her, leaning back against his desk, and watching the show from only a foot or two removed. Thirteen half-wondered if he could feel the heat from her pussy at that proximity.<br>
<br>
This couldn't have been much of a show - more an act of lewdness and desperation on the part of a frantic and frenzied beast. Mailgirls One and Fourteen, more than any of the other girls, had accepted their fate and turned their daily routines into stagecraft; they were actresses in performance piece, celebrities and stars in their own minds. Thirteen had watched, and heard, Fourteen get off on any number of occasions, and she'd often wondered how much of high-pitched whining and whimpering was for her own benefit, and how much was for her audience.<br>
<br>
Thirteen had become, through her presence in the locker room, somewhat of an expert in the sounds of the female orgasm. The shrieking and screaming she saw in pornography (and, yes, she'd picked up a mild porn addiction over the course of the summer) was entirely fake, but she'd heard some of the girls play it up anyways. Nineteen, for her part, swore like an angry sailor, and it was a habit that Seven had apparently picked up from her; the "fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck..." coming out of Seven's mouth, from elsewhere in the locker room, had irked Thirteen in recent weeks. There were "oohs" and "ahs" and "ohs," that ranged in octave from Thirteen's own deep, guttural exhalations to the near ultrasonic pitch of Twelve's squeaks. And a couple of the girls - Two and Three, for example, but also Fifteen - had the habit of sharing the fact they were cumming to anyone and everyone in earshot; "I'm cumming, I'm cumming," Fifteen would often declare as softly as she could, to no one in particular, an announcement she'd confessed she hadn't even known she was making at the time.<br>
<br>
There was no need for Thirteen to hold back now, though. She wasn't going to play up her climax like Fourteen or One might have, but she wasn't going to try to stay quiet. She had no shame anymore. This was for her benefit, not for theirs, and so she might as well enjoy it to the full extent she was allowed. An "oh..." escaped from between her lips, and was soon followed by a series of "ohs" thereafter. Within a minute or two she'd already begun to crest.<br>
<br>
"Fuck," she cursed, inadvertently at first. She hardly ever swore, and had never done so during sex. But she had been thinking about Seven, and so was channeling her now. She had blurted it out without thinking about it, without reflecting upon it, but now couldn't deny the power the utterance had. It was the perfect, dirty declaration of what was happening to her, and so she committed. "Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"<br>
<br>
She felt her body tighten, her toes curl, and her jaw drop open. With one final, deep, "Ohhhh...," she hit her climax, and did everything in her power to keep from collapsing into a puddle on the floor.<br>
<br>
But she wasn't through. Not yet. Her right hand slowed to a more deliberate and less frantic pace, but it didn't stop. And what she lost in speed she made up for with power. She called out, to anyone who would answer - be it Barrow, Mistress Zero, Mistress Rei, or even Gillian - a pleading, "Please, please, one more. Please, one more."<br>
<br>
There seemed to be a brief, unspoken discussion between Barrow and Mistress Zero, during which time Thirteen didn't wait for permission to be given. Until finally Mistress Zero spoke up, in an understanding but condescending tone, and answered, "Two minutes."<br>
<br>
It would be more than enough. Thirteen had never had to beg for sex before, never had to plead for the opportunity to keep touching herself. But that one last act of submission and surrender was undeniably and inescapably hot, and Thirteen began to cum almost immediately. The coming and going of her first and second orgasms bled together, and now she truly couldn't help herself; "FUUUCK!!" she barked, loud enough that any of the analysts still in their offices down the hall would have no questions about what she was doing, what she'd just achieved.<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of the orgasm, Thirteen grabbed her right nipple between the index and ring fingers of her left hand, and pressed her entire face into Barrow's rug. She pulled her right from her pussy, and now wet and sticky, she pressed it, too, against the floor. She worked to catch her breath, and each exhalation came out with a satisfied mew she didn't attempt to control.<br>
<br>
The satisfaction was momentary, however, and the shame washed over her soon thereafter. She'd just fucked herself, in Barrow's office, while Barrow watched from above. She'd given in, and then even begged for more, while Gillian had listened. And, as many times as she'd gotten herself off in front of Mistress Zero in the locker room, she didn't know Mistress Rei, and didn't know these two naked girls.<br>
<br>
Thirteen looked up at the two girls now. The one on the left was shaking visibly, if ever so slightly. The one of the right had straightened up, at attention, considerably, and Thirteen could see the stiffness in her body in the way her bare backside had tightened. Like Gillian, they hadn't exactly seen Thirteen's little show, but they'd witnessed her cumming - twice! - all the same.<br>
<br>
"Knees," Mistress Zero demanded, and she complied. Thirteen would have to continue to recover in that position; after she'd placed her hands behind her back, she was acutely aware of how her chest continued to heave, how her breasts continued to rise and fall with each labored breath.<br>
<br>
Barrow remained cool, calm, and collected. Without missing a beat, without giving away any arousal he himself might have been feeling, he reached behind him and produced a piece of candy. And not just any candy. "Lollipop?" he asked, and offered Thirteen a big, cherry red sucker, the exact brand that Kim Kinney had forced her to insert into herself earlier that day.<br>
<br>
Thirteen blanched. What did he know?<br>
<br>
"For your mouth, this time," he continued on. Everything, apparently.<br>
<br>
Barrow didn't wait for Thirteen to respond, to grant permission. Instead, he just pressed the unwrapped lollipop directly into Thirteen's mouth, and she was forced to accept it. She would have been a sight to behold - one pigtail still in and the other out, panting to catch her breath, covered in a light sheen of sweat, and sucking childishly on a big, bright red lollipop. It was too bad Gillian wasn't here to see her now.<br>
<br>
Gillian had been with her on Thirteen's first day, when Thirteen had first stripped naked in this very office. She'd accompanied her down to USF, to get her "settled," and to visit with Barrow at the start of this little experiment. Thirteen's clothes had been stacked in a neat little pile on Barrow's desk before the clock had even struck nine, and the next time she saw that white lace thong it was hanging in the hallway.<br>
<br>
But that morning hadn't even been the first time Gillian had seen her naked. Gillian been copied on the naked selfies that USF had required Thirteen to submit as part of her "application" to join the program. She'd also asked Thirteen to strip during office hours a few weeks earlier. Once Thirteen had submitted to Gillian's will, and had agreed to become a naked mailgirl in New York, Gillian had felt it important that Thirteen "accustom" herself to the exhibition that'd be expected of her at the Plaza. That first afternoon, Gillian had even undressed with her, and Thirteen could only hope she looked that good when she was in her fifties. But, in the following weeks, it was Thirteen alone in the nude, seated across from her advisor, atop a towel draped over one of Gillian's office chairs.<br>
<br>
They'd talked, weekly, about the progress Thirteen was making in her research, and her experiences among the mailgirls at USF. She'd been down to visit only once, and it had been on a Sunday - Gillian hadn't actually experienced the full extent of Thirteen's depravity until now, even if Thirteen had owned up to it during their calls.<br>
<br>
How much did Gillian know about the lollipop?<br>
<br>
"Another gift for you," Barrow said smoothly, and it struck Thirteen that the permission she'd been granted to masturbate in his office had been her first "gift." "We found your replacement for here at the Plaza."<br>
<br>
"Mistress Zero," he said. "Why don't you ask our new Mailgirl Thirteen to join her predecessor here?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Mistress Zero nodded, and joined the two naked girls at the edge of the office. She removed the hood from the girl on the right, and it was confirmed - from behind - that the new Mailgirl Number Thirteen had indeed been gagged. Short-ish, chin-length, raven black hair spilled from beneath the hood, and Thirteen recognized her now, even before she turned. Mistress Zero grabbed Kim Kinney roughly by her hair, stood her up, spun her around, and then directed her to knees next to Thirteen.<br>
<br>
Kim's eyes refused to meet Thirteen's. But Thirteen felt the rage, hate, and resentment nonetheless. It was clear from Kim's body language that she was seething. And, despite the empathy that Thirteen might have had for another mailgirl adjusting to her new life as the lowest of the lows, another wave of satisfaction overtook her. She'd read instances of this sort of come-uppance at other institutions, but had never experienced it here at USF. And, to Thirteen, it was delicious.<br>
<br>
As Thirteen had suspected, Kim's breasts were on the smaller end of the spectrum for a mailgirl. But they were likely still B's nonetheless, maybe only a smidge smaller than Mailgirl Number Ten's. And the undeniable allure of those large, dark areolas against the contrast of her milk white skin more than made up for the size of the breasts upon which they were affixed. It didn't escape notice that both nipples were standing straight out, at attention. Her hair, from having been inside the hood, was in disarray - but Thirteen admitted she was in no position to judge. Kim had a thin, slender figure, one would only become more tight and toned as she began climbing multiple flights of stairs throughout the day. And her pussy, while not yet shaved bare, was neatly and meticulously groomed into a thin, jet-black triangle above her slit. It had been so long since Thirteen had seen pubic hair, in real life, that she had a surprising urge to reach out and touch it, to run her fingers through the soft and scraggly hint of a bush.<br>
<br>
There was little more humiliating on a mailgirl's first day than being forced to shave bare. It was like being stripped all over again, having to give up one last layer of protection. Girls need to sit in the showers, their legs splayed, and carefully trim it all back. Even Thirteen, who had known what to expect and had gotten a full-on bikini wax the weekend before her first shift began, had been nonetheless forced to participate, to play along for the hooting and cheering audience on the far side of the locker room's mirror glass.<br>
<br>
Stealing focus from Kim's pubic hair and pornstar nipples, however, was the freshly inked number "13" she wore on her hip. This was a changing of the guards.<br>
<br>
Barrow pointed in Kim's direction, and instructed Mistress Zero to remove the girl's ball gag. "Yes, sir," the German woman replied. Of Mistress Rei, he asked that she remove Thirteen's collar. "Yes, sir," the Japanese woman repeated.<br>
<br>
The gag was removed, and Thirteen's metal collar found a new home around Kim Kinney's neck. Mistress Rei then proceeded, at Barrow's direction, to take off Thirteen's black lyrca armband. She slid the smartphone from its casing, handed it to Barrow, and then slipped it up the new Mailgirl Number Thirteen's arm. The original Number Thirteen worried how sweaty it still was.<br>
<br>
"I think we need to log one more session of 'polishing the pearl,'" Barrow said teasingly, punching his access code into the phone. "Or is it two?"<br>
<br>
Barrow knew full well each session was logged and recorded just once, but he was playing with her. One last humiliation, Thirteen told herself. One last time logged for posterity, so that anyone with access to the mailgirls app could have the final tally; Thirteen knew it was well over a hundred by that point, and wondered absently whether she'd yet passed the point she was closer to two.<br>
<br>
It had been a rhetorical question, but Thirteen dutifully answered, "One, sir." He ignored her.<br>
<br>
As much data as the smartphone on each girl's arm collected, it was still an underutilized piece of technology. It was the mailgirl app and the mailgirl app alone that the phone was expected to run, but it still had all of the capabilities of a regular smartphone. Barrow demonstrated that fact by finding his way into a browser, and pulled up a website. Within seconds, he'd found what he'd been looking for, and turned the phone so that the new Thirteen and the old Thirteen could both view the screen.<br>
<br>
It was picture of Thirteen, dressed in the bottom half of a Pepperdine cheerleader's outfit. Her skirt was hiked up, and there was very clearly a bright red lollipop either entering into or emerging out of Thirteen's bare pussy.<br>
<br>
Barrow scrolled a bit further down, with picture after picture of Thirteen in various states of dress and undress, the uniform half-on and half-off in most of them. And, as Kim had called out, it was the one of Thirteen fully dressed, but with the waistline pulled down so that her number "13" was visible, that Thirteen cringed at the most.<br>
<br>
She was happy that Kim was taking her place.<br>
<br>
"This took all of, what, ten minutes to hit social media?" Barrow asked. He wasn't outwardly angry, exactly, but there was a dangerous edge to his voice. He addressed Thirteen, "Within an hour we were getting calls from your alma mater."<br>
<br>
Thirteen swallowed.<br>
<br>
"They weren't pleased," he continued on. "But I promised them we'd handle it internally, and that the parties involved would be disciplined appropriately."<br>
<br>
To Kim, Barrow asked, "Do you have anything to say for yourself?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir," Kim replied, never meeting his eyes. It made no difference now if she complained, or explained, or defended herself. She might have done so earlier, when she'd first been approached. But she'd apparently already learned an important lesson in the life of mailgirl: shut up, don't fight back, and accept what was being done to and asked of you.<br>
<br>
"And you?" This, to Thirteen.<br>
<br>
"No, sir," Thirteen answered. She'd learned that lesson early, herself.<br>
<br>
Barrow closed the browser, pulled up the mailgirls app, and then punched in a series of keystrokes. Thirteen couldn't tell exactly what he was doing. But the fact that he handed the phone back to Mistress Zero, and told her that it now belonged to their new Number Thirteen, signified he'd likely reset the app for Kim.<br>
<br>
"Go," he told the dark-haired girl. He pulled the cherry lollipop from Thirteen's mouth, and then inserted it into Kim's. "Wait for your mistress in the hall."<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," Kim responded, and fled the room. Her new life awaited.<br>
<br>
Barrow sighed. "We lost a good banker today," he said reluctantly, as if rolling her into the mailgirl program had not been by choice. "Not as good as she thinks she is, though. Your friend Wagner is going to have to pick up a lot of slack."<br>
<br>
Drew Wagner was not her friend. He was nearly every bit as responsible for that afternoon's incident with the cheerleading outfit that Kim was; maybe even more so, given that it had likely been him who'd begun circulating the photos around to other Pepperdine alums and caught the attention of the university. She wished he'd been stripped and collared alongside Kim.<br>
<br>
"As for you..." Barrow began, sighing audibly.<br>
<br>
Whatever USF threw at her, Thirteen knew she could take. She'd grown strong that summer.<br>
<br>
"I had no choice, sir," Thirteen still explained, her protest coming off more desperate and whiney than she'd intended. Maybe she hadn't entirely learned to keep her mouth shut.<br>
<br>
Barrow shrugged. He didn't care. He likely knew about the whole incident, either from Kim or from Drew or from the others. He likely knew she'd been given no choice, and that Kim had put her in an impossible position. And yet, he had still let Mistress Rei spank her for demerits she hadn't exactly earned.<br>
<br>
"As for you," he began again, and took a step away from her, towards the window, "bear in mind that you'll still have to answer for this. There are a couple of trustees who are demanding their pound of flesh, and I'm not sure your replacement out there is going to be enough."<br>
<br>
He paused. "But, we'll get to that. I want you to understand that what Doctor Schang and I called you here for today was worked out a few weeks ago. And that a fortuitous happenstance landed in our laps just this morning, before any of this came to light."<br>
<br>
Thirteen was confused.<br>
<br>
"You were out of uniform. And the...er...lollipop absolutely crossed a line we're not willing to cross here at Plaza. But, honestly, I could care less about the photos - I only wish they hadn't been stamped with the school's name all over them." He reached the other naked girl, the one still hooded, and rested his hand atop her head. "But you've done good work with us here this summer. Maybe a few too many demerits? The research and insights that you've come across, that Doctor Schang had shared with us, are going to be instrumental as we expand the mailgirls program to our regional offices."<br>
<br>
Thirteen had known Gillian was sharing her notes with Barrow, though wasn't entirely sure to what extent. The expansion of USF's mailgirl program was news to her, however, but perhaps not surprising; the mailgirls phenomenon seemed to be gaining traction and mainstream recognition nationally.<br>
<br>
"So we've worked out an arrangement for you to stay with us."<br>
<br>
"They'll fuck you," Twelve had warned her that morning. "Some sort of threat. Some sort of bullshit penalty. Some sort of legal maneuvering we're too fucking dumb to see coming."<br>
<br>
Thirteen simply shook her head. "No, no, no."<br>
<br>
"We're experimenting a bit across the river, at our back office in Jersey City," Barrow barreled on, ignoring her. "And as important as it is - as I think we can all agree that it is - to draw from the local talent there, I thought it might be helpful for a more experienced mailgirl to help kick off the program, and help set an example. So to speak."<br>
<br>
"No, no, no," Thirteen repeated. She hadn't gotten up off her knees, but her arms were no longer behind her back. Her head was spinning. "You can't do this!"<br>
<br>
"Excuse me?"<br>
<br>
Instinctively, Thirteen corrected herself. "You can't do this, sir." She regretted the "sir" the moment it left her lips.<br>
<br>
"I have a contract," Thirteen continued. "I have a contract. For three months."<br>
<br>
"We've amended it," Barrow explained.<br>
<br>
"You can't just amend a contract!"<br>
<br>
"We can. We have Power of Attorney."<br>
<br>
"No, you don't. You don't!"<br>
<br>
It came crashing down all at once: Gillian. Thirteen had refused to sign over Power of Attorney to USF, almost causing the entire arrangement to fall apart. USF didn't want her at the Plaza without that concession, and Thirteen hadn't been willing cede it - for exactly this reason. She'd read of too many accounts of a girl's contract being extended or amended, too many instances of a girl being rendered powerless as her company rolled right over any residual rights she thought she might have. And so Thirteen and USF had reached a compromise - Thirteen would sign over her Power of Attorney, but only to Gillian and the Anthropology Department back in Connecticut.<br>
<br>
"Gillian? Gillian, what did you do?" Thirteen cried in the direction of the speaker phone.<br>
<br>
There was no apology. Only an explanation. "The company offered to fund our research for the next two years." It was "our" research, even though it was Thirteen being sacrificed to the cause. "And I think this is an opportunity for you."<br>
<br>
"No!" Thirteen shrieked. "No! Fuck you, no!"<br>
<br>
She'd crossed a line, and was rewarded for punishment at the hands of Mistress Rei once more. The smaller of the two mistresses took hold of hair and dragged her to the ground. She was back on all fours, prostrate on the floor of Will Barrow's office once more.<br>
<br>
Thirteen's chest heaved, and she worked to regain her composure.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry," she apologized. Again, more out of instinct after a summer of complete submissiveness. When Mistress Rei didn't immediately release her hair, Thirteen corrected herself. "I'm sorry, ma'am."<br>
<br>
Gillian laughed on the far end of the phone. Clearly uncomfortable, she offered, "We don't have to start with the 'ma'am's and madams."<br>
<br>
Thirteen took a deep breath, and offered bitterly, "A mailgirl is not allowed to refer to her betters by name."<br>
<br>
"Okay," Gillian answered, sensing the resentment in Thirteen's voice. "Doctor Schang, then."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Doctor Schang."<br>
<br>
"Your studies are on hold," Gillian explained. "But you can pick them up again when your contract has been fulfilled. And the University has agreed to waive all of your current student debt. Your final year here, too, is entirely covered."<br>
<br>
Gracious of them, Thirteen thought sarcastically to herself. Aloud, it was just, "Yes, Doctor Schang."<br>
<br>
Thirteen's terse responses were clearly affecting Gillian. But, what had she been expecting? She tried to reason with the girl, "Sarah. Sarah, honey. You're twenty-six years old. You have your whole life ahead of you. You'll still be twenty-eight when your contract is through, and you're going to finish your PhD at twenty-nine. There's already a paper here; it'll be a book by the time you're done, and you'll have places like Yale chasing after you. Sarah, you're going to be fine."<br>
<br>
"Mailgirl Number Thirteen," the naked blonde corrected. "It's Thirteen."<br>
<br>
Gillian hesitated. She spoke the name aloud, "Thirteen."<br>
<br>
"For now," Mistress Rei announced. Her own part in this tragic comedy suddenly made sense. The little Japanese woman was to be the new mistress in USF's back office. She'd likely been plucked herself, like Mistress Zero, from the life of a mailgirl somewhere overseas.<br>
<br>
"For now, mistress," Thirteen spat. Whatever number they planned for her to wear in Jersey City, she was still Thirteen for now. Kim Kinney may have taken her collar and her number, but it was still Number Thirteen that had been scrawled time and time again on her naked hip, still Number Thirteen that was prominently displayed now.<br>
<br>
"And if I refuse, Doctor Schang?" She looked behind her, was granted permission from Mistress Rei, and rose back to her knees. It was an entirely moot and pointless question. She'd been shown the carrot; the stick was likely to be awful.<br>
<br>
She wasn't disappointed. Barrow fielded the question, at least initially. "You'd be in violation of your contract, and the contract we signed with your department."<br>
<br>
Gillian, over the phone, went on. "Which would lead to your removal from my graduate program. And invalidate the credits you've earned at the University."<br>
<br>
She'd be back to square one, Thirteen realized bitterly. She either gave up the next two years of her life, or she'd effectively wasted her last four.<br>
<br>
There was more, of course. Gillian continued, "All debt the university is owed is due immediately, and you'll be required to refund the full amount you spent this summer out of our grant."<br>
<br>
Neither was possible, of course. She'd flitted away more of the research grant on food and clothes than she'd ever thought possible, and her student loan debt was astronomical. Even Chapter 7 wasn't an out - USF's mailgirl contract, the one that Gillian had apparently signed on her behalf, included a special proviso that closed off bankruptcy as an escape for debt owed to the company. If she walked away now, not only would everything she'd worked for have been for naught, but she'd also be sunk down a pit of debt so deep she might never escape.<br>
<br>
Still, what if she went back to the Bay Area? What if she waited tables? That could be a life, couldn't it? That could be her life. Hell, even the life of a stripper or a topless dancer might be better than this one; she was now certainly well qualified, and even those options would have allowed her some amount of agency that the life of a mailgirl did not.<br>
<br>
And yet...<br>
<br>
And yet, hadn't a part of her worried about missing this life? She'd been afraid to admit it to herself, but it had been there for the past few weeks. Lurking, but omnipresent. Just out of reach. That little voice at the back of her head, the one she tried so desperately to keep at bay. She'd miss this life. It wasn't rational. It wasn't evolved. It wasn't anything that she could have imagined she'd ever feel. But the irrational, un-evolved, animal part of her brain wasn't ready to become Sarah Scott again just yet.<br>
<br>
In captivity, she'd found release. Thirteen had come alive over the course of the last three months. She was more sexually realized than she'd ever been in twenty-six years. She'd cum harder, more often, and more intensely as a mailgirl than she ever had as a student. As submissive as she was expected to be, as subservient and subjugated and mistreated as she was, she felt more confident in who she was today than she had been in May. As embarrassed and as humiliated as she was on a daily basis, she was arguably more self-assured, with a better body image, than she had been before coming to New York. She had purpose and direction, and a freedom from the concerns of the outside world; she'd found a zen-like calm in focusing on the task at hand - her only job, her sole purpose, was to deliver the mail. That summer had been a vacation from herself, a vacation from her real life, and there'd been an undeniable feeling of longing and loss as she'd thought about returning to New Haven.<br>
<br>
"My apartment, Doctor Schang?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"I will reach out to Residential Life," Gillian answered, referring to the graduate housing Thirteen called her home back in Connecticut.<br>
<br>
Thirteen shook her head, despite the fact that her advisor couldn't see. "My apartment in New York, Doctor Schang?"<br>
<br>
Barrow fielded the question. "We're trying something new in our Jersey City office." His tone had shifted slightly. This was no longer an argument with a protesting mailgirl. This was merely hammering out the details. "We have a dormitory for our girls laid out in the basement of the building, just off the employee cafeteria."<br>
<br>
Thirteen didn't need to see the dormitory to know that a one-way mirror likely separated the dormitory from the cafeteria; the mailgirls would find no privacy, no escape, no cause to believe they were anything more than animals in a zoo. Her twelve-hour shifts would become twenty-four hour shifts, her opportunity to escape USF at the end of the day would be taken away, her chances of ever getting dressed again over the next two years were slim. Barrow more or less confirmed this, even as he offered some allowances that he believed to be a silver lining.<br>
<br>
"We're taking into account your research," he explained. "You'll be allowed your 'bitch sessions' once a week, on Saturday nights, in one of the employee lounges on-site. And I recognize we might have gone too far here at the Plaza, and so fraternization within the mailgirls will be allowed. So long as you're off-duty."<br>
<br>
"And Sundays..." Gillian added.<br>
<br>
"And Sundays," Barrow nodded, and continued on, "will belong to Doctor Schang. That's one for you alone, obviously, but you'll have a cubicle available to you in the Human Capital offices there, to continue your work."<br>
<br>
Her research had been incorporated into USF's vision of the mailgirls program of the future, and had amounted to little more than a once-weekly break, at work, and a recognition that lesbian sex was a need-to-have. And she'd be expected to continue chronicling her life for the woman who'd sold her out - no, sold her off - for the next two years.<br>
<br>
The fight, though, had gone out of her. "My things, sir?" she asked meekly.<br>
<br>
Barrow smiled. "We picked them up from your apartment today. Thank you for packing."<br>
<br>
She'd packed for New Haven, not for New Jersey.<br>
<br>
When Thirteen hesitated in her response, Barrow sensed a question. "Call me presumptuous," he said. The implication was that Thirteen had never really had a choice in any of this. She'd be going to USF's back office in Jersey City, even if it had meant going kicking and screaming. Instead, resigned to her fate, Thirteen now accepted obediently.<br>
<br>
But something tickled the back of her mind. She only had one set of keys, and - last she'd checked - they were still in her purse in the locker room. How had they gotten into her apartment?<br>
<br>
Barrow smiled again, when asked. His reaction was terrifying. He answered, "Your sister was kind enough to let us in."<br>
<br>
What? Thirteen didn't understand. Sophie was on the other side of the continent, back in Westwood. Who...?<br>
<br>
A wave of nausea overtook her, and she fought the urge to vomit. The realization hit her even before Barrow removed Sophie's hood. There was a reason that the naked girl by the window seemed so familiar - even undressed, even from behind. Sophie didn't even need to turn around for Thirteen to know it was her.<br>
<br>
"No," she said in horror, shaking her head. She recoiled, half-standing and taking a step backwards, before collapsing back on to her knees. She caught herself with her left hand, but her right rose instinctually to her chest, and she could feel her heart beating like crazy. She shook her head again. "No, no, no..."<br>
<br>
Barrow unsnapped the other girl's ball gag from the back of her head. But, rather than let Sophie explain for herself, he continued on. "You inspired her. She reached out to us." He stroked Sophie's hair, petting her like a domesticated animal. "Red-eye from Los Angeles that got in at dawn. Your doorman apparently recognized her, and let her into your apartment. She called into the Plaza this morning, and was directed to my office."<br>
<br>
"Sarah-" Sophie began, with a sob.<br>
<br>
She was cut short, however, as Barrow balled her long blonde hair in his fist and jerked her head to catch her attention. He slapped her with the open-faced palm of his free hand - not violently, but enough to act as a reprimand. "Mailgirls are not permitted names." He looked to Thirteen, and corrected her sister, "I believe you mean Mailgirl Number Thirteeen."<br>
<br>
"For now, sir." Mistress Rei inserted herself once more. Thirteen now belonged to her.<br>
<br>
Barrow nodded.<br>
<br>
"Mailgirl Number Thirteen..." Sophie began again, again through a sob, and was again interrupted by Barrow.<br>
<br>
"Number One," he said, addressing Sophie, "why don't you take your place beside your sister, on your knees?"<br>
<br>
Sophie rose and turned, revealing that she was already almost entirely "in uniform." She was a few inches taller than her sister, with breasts just a touch smaller but no less perfect. She was already shaved bare; like Thirteen, she'd known what was to be expected of her. She was wearing a mailgirl's collar, thick and metal, and had been inked with a number "1" in black marker on her hip. Only the absence of an armband and smartphone distinguished her from any of the other girls here at the Plaza.<br>
<br>
Thirteen felt another dry heave coming on, but worked to suppress it. The panic and anxiety of her own captivity, as well as that of Sophie's, was forgotten momentarily; instead, it was fact that she'd just finger-fucked herself while her sister was in the room that had her stomach turning. Every humiliation she'd just suffered ran through her mind and humiliated her anew, now knowing that it was Sophie - Jersey City's Mailgirl Number One - who'd been a part of her audience.<br>
<br>
As she got to her knees, One's eyes caught Thirteen's. Sophie's caught Sarah's. It was one look, before both of them bowed their heads submissively in Barrow's direction. One look that spoke volumes. One look that made any explanations between them unnecessary.<br>
<br>
This was her sister's "out," such as it were. She'd been with John her entire life, and had felt increasingly trapped in a life that felt chosen for her, one that seemed to be based on momentum more than any conscious choice. She was going to dental school because John was going to dental school. She was getting married because he'd asked, and she was supposed to say yes - wasn't she? This wasn't about Barrow. Or USF. Or New York. Or Thirteen, even if Thirteen's participation in the program had likely triggered the thought, or given her the courage to sign on. No, this was about Sophie; rather, for the next two years, this was about Mailgirl Number One. And the only thing that Mailgirl Number One needed to worry about for the next two years was hitting her delivery deadlines. Thirteen suspected - and would later confirm - that despite the desperate texts sent in a moment of panic that morning, her sister had avoided telling her about the decision for fear that Thirteen would try to talk her out of it.<br>
<br>
And, honestly, who was Thirteen to judge? She knew that her own eyes gave away the desperation and submission she felt. It wasn't exactly that there was no fight left in her; it was that this life was too hard for her to walk away from just yet. Whether she had a choice in the matter, or whether it was Gillian deciding for her, Thirteen would be going to Jersey City. She had found herself over the past few months, and it was time to embrace what she'd found with open eyes. She was more alive, more adventurous, more satiated and satisfied as a mailgirl than she'd ever been before. She'd found freedom from the pressures of her old life by ceding control in the new.<br>
<br>
Her sister would need someone to help her along the way, someone to help her on her own road to self discovery, someone to help her find those moments of hope and gratification among the humiliation and degradation. As would a whole new class of USF mailgirls in Jersey City.<br>
<br>
And so, without another word, Thirteen rose back to her knees. She straightened her back, puffed out her chest, and took her sister's hand. Whatever awaited them across the river, whatever "gift" Barrow might bestow upon them next, they'd face it together. As sisters.<br>
<br>
This was life among the mailgirls.<br>
<br>
This was life as a mailgirl.
