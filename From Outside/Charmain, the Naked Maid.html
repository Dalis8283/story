This story is intended for ADULTS ONLY. &nbsp;<br>A beautiful young woman in Victorian England starts a new job as housemaid in the the country manor of an important lord. Soon, she finds herself on the wrong end of some old-fashioned discipline and is forced by an evil butler to work stark naked - when she oversleeps, he pulls her rudely out of bed and sends her scurrying to work just as she is, not caring that she sleeps in the nude. Providing much enjoyment for her male co-workers, she dutifully performs her assigned chores sans clothing. The butler finds that entertaining and prolongs her punishment to a week. <br>A couple of months later though, her ordeal is still not over... Will she ever get her clothes back?<br>The book explores the topics on an <mark style="background-color: #FFD04B;">Embarrassed Nude Female (ENF), Clothed Male / Naked Female (CMNF), Only One Naked (OON) and some light spanking</mark>.

<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 1 [INTRODUCTION] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
The cold autumn air wrapped itself around Charmaine as she approached the grand Victorian mansion. She clutched her plain cloak tightly around her body, fearful not only of the chill but of what lay ahead. Her heart raced faster than the horses pulling carriages along the nearby road. She knew this was the beginning of a journey that would change her life forever. &nbsp;<br><br>
She climbed the large stone steps leading to the entrance, feeling the weight of expectations pressing down on her. Charmaine took a deep breath, summoning courage she didn't know she possessed.<br><br>
She raised her hand to knock, her fingers trembling slightly against the wood. As she rapped her knuckles against the heavy door, it swung open, revealing a luxurious hallway lined with antique furniture and ornate paintings. She stepped inside, cautiously glancing at her surroundings.<br><br>
A butler stood near the entrance, his eyes fixed upon her, assessing her presence. His face remained impassive, betraying no emotion.<br><br>
His lips curled into a thin line, exposing his perfect teeth, unbroken by age or experience. He wore a well-tailored suit, complete with a starched collar and a tie neatly tied in a classic Windsor knot. "My name is Mr. Paine," he introduced himself, stepping forward with a hint of arrogance. "Welcome to The Manor."<br><br>
The butler looked at her with an undisguised appraisal, causing her to blush.<br><br>
"Well, Charmaine," he said, his voice cold and distant. "I trust you're prepared for your duties here?"<br><br>
Charmaine nodded hesitantly, trying to appear confident despite her anxiety. "Yes, sir."<br><br>
He gestured toward the door leading deeper into the mansion.<br><br>
"Follow me, Charmaine. I will show you to your quarters and introduce you to some of the other staff."
<br><br>As they made their way through the opulent corridors, Charmaine couldn't help but feel awestruck by the sheer grandeur of her new surroundings. Every corner seemed to contain some hidden treasure, each piece of art telling its own tale.

<br><br>Eventually, they reached the room where Charmaine would live. The chamber was small, but cozy, furnished only with a simple bed and a dresser. It was empty, and she did not have possessions to fill it with.

<br><br>"You will be given a house uniform," the butler informed her. "What you are wearing now is not fit to be worn in the household of a Peer of the Realm. It will be cut up for rags."

<br><br>"The cost of the uniform will be deducted from your wages," he continued. "It is quite substantial - equal to your wages for three months. In effect, we are giving you a loan, something we would not normally do. However, in light of the request - nay, plea - by your village vicar to give you a helping hand..."

<br><br>The butler stood quiet for a while, then added more for his own sake than for hers, "he was a chaplain in the regiment and has earned Sir Richard's respect."

<br><br>Mr. Paine then directed her to the communal area - a large kitchen where the other servants gathered for meals and relaxation. She saw a group of people - mostly women - engaged in various tasks, tidying up and chatting amongst themselves.

<br><br>There were maids, cooks, and even a few gardeners. Each one of them wore their uniforms, signifying their respective roles within the household. Charmaine felt a sudden wave of anxiety. She wondered how she would fit in with these old hands.

<br><br>Mr. Paine cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention. "We have a new hire," he announced, gesturing towards Charmaine.

<br><br>The other servants turned to look at her, a mixture of curiosity and surprise reflected in their gaze.

<br>Charmaine smiled timidly, hoping to put their minds at ease. "Good morning, everyone," she greeted them.<br>

<br>Feeling the weight of their scrutiny, Charmaine asked Mr. Paine, "What duties am I expected to perform here?"<br>

<br>"You are to serve as a junior housemaid in this household. Your primary responsibility will be to ensure the cleanliness and orderliness of the place, mainly in the servants quarters. In addition, you will assist with preparing meals, laundry, and any other tasks assigned to you by the senior staff."<br>

<br>Charmaine nodded, trying to absorb the information. She knew this job would demand hard work and dedication, but she was determined to prove herself capable. "I understand, Mr. Paine."<br>
<br>"As butler, my job is to manage staff and not allow tardiness and laziness. Sir Richard approves of strict discipline and we all take his wishes seriously."<br>
With a grim smile, Mr. Paine continued, "For those who do not comply, there are consequences."<br>
<br>
Charmaine gulped, her eyes widening in understanding.<br>
<br>
As she went about her tasks, Charmaine soon discovered that Mr. Paine seemed to have developed a strange fascination with her, and enjoyed testing her. One afternoon, while cleaning in the kitchen, he entered the room without warning. He handed her a feather duster, which she immediately began using to remove the accumulated dust on the spice jars.<br>
<br>
As she carefully buffed the shelves, Charmaine couldn't help but notice Mr. Paine's keen observation of her efforts. She felt her cheeks redden as she sensed his silent judgment.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Mr. Paine spoke up, startling Charmaine out of her thoughts. "You are getting too much dust onto your uniform. Why don't you take it off to keep it clean? We wouldn't want to cause extra work for the laundry now, would we?" His tone held a mix of mockery and malice, making Charmaine feel exposed and vulnerable.<br>
Her cheeks flushed, her heart pounding rapidly. "What a horribly inappropriate thing to say," she thought to herself as she hastily finished her task and fled the room before he could say anything more.
<br><br>
The walk back to her quarters was slow and agonizing, her mind racing with thoughts of how to avoid further embarrassment at the hands of Mr. Paine. How could she possibly make him accept her as just another servant who properly belongs here?
<br><br>
Back in her room, Charmaine laid down on her bed, her thoughts turning to the other servants she had met earlier. They seemed friendly enough, albeit somewhat stand-offish. Perhaps they could provide her with advice on dealing with Mr. Paine and the challenges of working in such a place.
<br><br>
That evening, Charmaine sought refuge in the kitchen where she found comfort among the other servants. As they prepared dinner, the conversation shifted towards the peculiarities of the household, and Charmaine listened intently, picking up valuable tips on navigating the twisted world of the manor.
<br><br>
"Now, you must always remember, Charmaine," warned a seasoned maid named Jane, as she stirred a pot of soup. "Never question the butler's decisions. He has the full confidence of Sir Richard, who was a regiment commander in his time and is a great believer in strict discipline."
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded, her eyes wide with apprehension. She realized that maintaining a good relationship with Mr. Paine would be crucial to her survival in this household.
Some days later, however, Charmaine broke a glass when cleaning up the table after lunch. She panicked, realizing the gravity of her mistake. Mr. Paine, observing her from across the room, smirked with satisfaction.
<br><br>
Charmaine faced Mr. Paine, attempting to mask her fear. "I am sorry, sir." He eyed her with a predatory gleam, his eyes narrowing. "You have broken a glass, Charmaine. This shows irresponsible carelessness. To prevent this from happening again, I believe a small lesson is in order." His voice dripped with sarcasm, emphasizing his disdain for her transgression.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart thumped wildly as she tried to control her breathing. She knew she was about to endure a punishment that would leave her humiliated. With a resigned sigh, she replied, "Yes, sir."
<br><br>
"If you were a child, you would receive a bare bottom spanking by hand. If you were a soldier in Sir Richard's regiment, you might get the lash. Seeing as you are a housemaid, you will get something in-between: a bare bottom spanking, but not by hand. I believe a strap would do nicely."
<br><br>
Mr. Paine sneered, twisting his lips in a vicious smile. "It'll be a fitting reminder of the importance of focus and precision."
<br><br>
Charmaine felt her heart race, her skin breaking out in goosebumps. Her legs wobbled underneath her, as she struggled to maintain her composure. Mr. Paine gestured for her to follow him, heading deeper into the manor's labyrinth of rooms.<br><br>
As they walked, Charmaine noticed the chill in the air seemed to intensify, almost as if it mirrored the frigidity of Mr. Paine's demeanor. Each step echoed throughout the hallway, creating an atmosphere of both anticipation and dread. Finally, they arrived at a secluded room adorned with dark wooden furniture, exuding an aura of malevolence.
<br><br>
With a cruel smile, Mr. Paine closed the door behind them, adding a sense of desperation to the situation. He led Charmaine to a small bare table in the center of the room. From a dresser, he retrieved the short but thick leather strap which he normally used to sharpen his razor on.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart hammered against her rib cage, her pulse accelerating in panic.<br><br>
He motioned for her to face away from him, her hands clasped in front of her. With a cold indifference, he pushed her shoulders down until she had to press against the table with her hands for support.
<br><br>
Her heart raced as she heard the rustle of fabric behind her.
A sharp raising of her skirt revealed her white drawers. Unbelievably, the butler next brusquely pulled those down to her ankles, revealing her bare bottom. Mr. Paine's gaze raked over her, his eyes filled with sadistic pleasure.
<br><br>
Charmaine's breath caught in her throat, her body tensing with fear and embarrassment. The cool air caressed her bare skin, sending shivers down her spine.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine gazed at her for a long time, the strap dangling menacingly in his hand. Suddenly, with a forceful swing, he brought the strap down upon her bottom, leaving a fiery stripe across her flesh. Charmaine let out a muffled cry, unable to suppress the pain.
<br><br>
Her eyes stung with tears, blurring her vision slightly. As Mr. Paine swung the strap again, she felt fire surge through her skin, leaving an angry red mark in its wake. Her heart raced in her chest, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The butler relished in her misery, his eyes alight with sick pleasure.
<br><br>
Each stinging stroke sent waves of pain coursing through Charmaine's body, causing her to writhe in agony. Tears streamed down her cheeks, unchecked. But amidst the torment, her resolve remained steadfast - she would not break, she would not succumb to the despair.
<br><br>
The butler's sadistic gaze never left her as he continued the cruel punishment. Her once flawless bottom now bore angry red marks where the strap had hit. The pain was excruciating, her skin raw and sensitive. But more than that, she felt deeply violated by his gaze upon her bare skin, looking at parts of her that were not supposed to be seen by a man.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine's apparent pleasure at seeing her partial nudity only added to her suffering.
<br><br>
After what felt like an eternity, Mr. Paine finally ceased his assault. Slowly, Charmaine raised herself off the table, touching her aching bottom, struggling to hide her shame. He smiled, a triumphant glint in his eyes, knowing that he had successfully made his point.
<br><br>
Charmaine, feeling defeated and ashamed, hurried back to her room, avoiding eye contact with anyone she passed. Once there, she allowed herself to collapse onto her bed, allowing the sobs to escape her tightly controlled throat. She felt utterly powerless, and her resolve to resist Mr. Paine's domination wavered.
<br><br>
She thought that in future her best course of action would be to avoid any interaction with Mr. Paine - stay hidden in the shadows of the house, blending into the background. <br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 2 [The Nightmare Begins (Monday Morning)] ===</span></div><br><br>
Charmaine had vowed to do everything possible in order to not attract the attention of Mr. Paine again, and get into more trouble. However, fate had other plans for her, and those were horrible beyond belief.<br><br>

A couple of weeks later, a fateful thing happened. On Sunday, Charmaine had gone to the nearest village with a couple of the other maids to visit the local market and to explore the neighbourhood. The excitement of the novelty had her tossing in bed a long time before she finally went to sleep. The next morning, she overslept - a thing she had never done before.<br><br>


Being late for one's duties was unthinkable in this strict household. Mr Paine was alerted by the cook, and he burst into Charmaine's room while she was still in bed.<br><br>


His expression was filled with fury, his eyes flashing dangerously. "How dare you sleep in?" he growled, grabbing her roughly by the arm. "Do you think such sloth will be tolerated here?" He quickly drew off the blanket and pulled her to her feet, his grip leaving bruises on her wrist. He was so furious that he gave the impression he had not even noticed that Charmaine slept naked, and was now displayed in her full glory before him.<br><br>


"Report to the kitchen at once, or breakfast will be late! We cannot have Sir Richard's daily routine interrupted because of your negligence!"<br><br>


Charmaine, trembling with fear, her mind racing with possible consequences for her late start, stammered: "Let me just wash and get dressed, I am still naked". As she said that, she scrambled to cover herself with the sheet, but her hands shook uncontrollably.<br><br>


Mr. Paine's was having none of that. He gave her a cold stare, unmoved by her plea. "There is no time for you to dally any further. Mrs. Atkinson has been working alone too long already," he stated firmly, his voice devoid of pity. "You will have to help her as you are. Now."<br><br>


Charmaine's heart sank as she realized she had no choice but to comply. Any possible hesitation evaporated when the butler, still holding her wrist, roughly pulled her out of the room and she found herself in the corridor, feeling her vulnerability amplified. The cool morning air brushed against her bare skin, making her shiver. The closing of the door behind her felt like the inevitability of a death sentence.<br><br>


Mr. Paine, however, appeared quite undisturbed.<br><br>


His eyes gleamed with malice as he watched Charmaine shiver, reveling in her discomfort. It seemed that for him, the colder the better. The butler then grabbed her arm roughly, leading her towards the kitchen area. Charmaine, filled with trepidation, tried to walk beside him with dignity, but her steps faltered. He pushed her to go in front and gave her bare bottom a quick smack, then walked behind her, no doubt enjoying the view.<br><br>


As they approached the kitchen, Charmaine could hear the faint sound of clinking silverware and clattering plates in the distance.<br><br>


The air was filled with the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread and brewing coffee. Her stomach rumbled, yearning for food. Despite her hunger, she felt a deep dread as she entered the bustling kitchen, acutely aware of her exposed state.<br><br>

Mr. Paine directed her toward the massive wooden table reserved for staff meals. Standing in front of it, Charmaine attempted to regain some semblance of composure. Mrs. Atkinson, the head cook, stared at her disbelievingly, and raised an eyebrow questioningly at the butler.<br><br>

The cook's gaze, steeped in disapproval, told Charmaine all she needed to know about the implications of her presence among the staff wearing nothing at all. Her cheeks flushed crimson, and she desperately wished for the floor to swallow her up. One of the kitchen boys, observing this whole exchange, couldn't help but smirk maliciously at Charmaine's predicament. As luck with have, the others were not there, no doubt having been sent on some errand elsewhere.<br><br>

"What do you think you're doing, girl?" Mrs. Atkinson demanded harshly, her voice cutting through the sounds of the kitchen.Mr. Paine answered instead. "Charmaine has shown herself tardy, and needs a bit of a lesson, since she does not seem to have learned from the previous one."<br><br>

"She will work as she is, and I expect you to not be lenient on her today. In fact, I expect you to find some additional duties for her to occupy her time."<br><br>

With that, the butler turned and left the kitchen, on his way to supervising other parts of the household."This is highly unusual", murmured the cook.<br><br>

"However, let's get on with it and waste time no further, we have much to do," Mrs. Atkinson declared sharply, snapping Charmaine back to reality. Trying to block out any thoughts of her state of nudity, she decided it was best to dive straight into the tasks assigned to her. With trembling fingers, she began taking orders from Mrs. Atkinson, trying her best to remember each task and execute them flawlessly. The cook remained stern throughout, scrutinizing Charmaine's every move, ensuring she did not forget anything or made mistakes.<br><br>

Under the watchful eye of Mrs. Atkinson, Charmaine diligently worked on, trying her best to maintain her composure, determined not to let her current state of undress affect her performance. Mrs. Atkinson glanced over occasionally, observing Charmaine's struggles. She was annoyed by Charmaine's tardiness and while she did not fully agree with her subsequent punishment - which seemed to be devised mostly for the butler's personal delectation - she thought it was not her place to interfere with Mr. Paine's decisions, and had no intention of showing any mercy.<br><br>

As Charmaine busied herself with the various chores assigned to her, Stanley the kitchen boy looked in fascination on all her efforts. His eyes sparkled with mischief, and he began devising new tasks for her to complete. These tasks were designed to place her in increasingly awkward and compromising positions. Mrs. Atkinson, while not encouraging the boy in his shenanigans, did not by any means try to limit his mischief either. After all, Charmaine was being punished, and thus Stanley's little tricks were merely a part of that. Charmaine would learn her lesson soon enough, and these minor inconveniences would only serve to reinforce that message.<br><br>

As she stood there, her body tense with anxiety, Stanley approached her with a large laundry basket. His grin widened as he looked her up and down, clearly relishing the opportunity to make her squirm even more.<br><br>

"Can you help me carry this laundry basket to the storage room?" he asked, his tone dripping with insinuation. Charmaine hesitated, then nodded reluctantly and reached out to take hold of the basket's handle. As she lifted it, the weight of the heavy load sent her balance off-kilter, causing her to wobble precariously.<br><br>

The basket slipped from her grasp, spilling its contents onto the floor. Charmaine blushed deeply, feeling even more humiliated than before. She hastily bent down to gather the fallen napkins and cloths.<br><br>

Mrs. Atkinson observed the scene with a mix of frustration and amusement. This was indeed an unusual situation, one she had not witnessed before. But, she reminded herself, Charmaine was only getting what she deserved. Stanley appreciated the view, and even walked around her so he could stare at her bare bottom from behind. He even pointed out a napkin which had fallen under the table, so that Charmaine had to stretch to reach it.<br><br>

Charmaine's face burned red with embarrassment. As she struggled to gather the scattered laundry, Mrs. Atkinson spoke up sternly. "Now, Charmaine, I've seen you trip over your own two feet before, but this is quite something. You'll need to work harder if you want to retain your position here."<br><br>

Charmaine bowed her head, unable to meet the cook's disapproving gaze. She knew Mrs. Atkinson was right; she had shown herself to be careless and lacking in focus.<br><br>

Feeling thoroughly defeated, Charmaine continued gathering the scattered towels and napkins, her cheeks burning with shame and embarrassment.<br><br>

She quickly gathered the last few pieces, her movements now more careful and deliberate. Her hands shook slightly as she placed the laundry back into the basket, the evidence of her earlier clumsiness still visible. She noticed Mrs. Atkinson watching her closely, her expression unreadable.
<br><br>
Stanley grabbed one handle of the heavy basket with two hands, and motioned for Charmaine to do likewise with the other.
<br><br>
Together, they slowly carried the laundry to the storage room. Charmaine's arms quivered under the strain, and her breathing became labored. Stanley made no secret of his enjoyment of the spectacle of her rhythmically moving, swaying breasts.
<br><br>
"Here, let me help you with that," he said, reaching out to take a laundry basket handle from Charmaine. He was close enough for Charmaine to feel his hot breath against her ear as he whispered, "You're really getting used to walking around without clothes, aren't you?"
<br><br>
As they returned to the kitchen, she mentally prepared herself for whatever task Stanley might devise next. Closing her eyes for a moment, she took a deep breath, mustering all her strength and determination.
<br><br>
Still, she was shaken when Stanley reminded her: "It is time to setup table for the staff breakfast, all the house servants will be here shortly."
<br><br>
Charmaine gulped nervously; she had been with the cook and Stanley only so far, and they were the only ones to have seen her without clothes. Any vague hopes that her punishment would be limited to that were shattered. She had completely blocked out from her mind the fact that each morning, all household staff had common breakfast in the kitchen.
<br><br>
Mrs. Atkinson stepped in. "Bring the tablecloth and utensils from the storage room, Charmaine. And Stanley, you should fetch the tea kettle and coffee pot."
<br><br>
Stanley's eyes gleamed with mischief as he retrieved the tea kettle and coffee pot. Knowing full well that it would expose Charmaine's modesty further, he said casually, "Please put the tablecloth on, dear."
<br><br>
Charmaine, blushing profusely, began arranging the tablecloth on the table, praying fervently that her shaking hands wouldn't cause it to fall. Each step around the table felt agonizingly slow as she painstakingly spread the cover under Stanley's watchful gaze; bending over with her breasts hanging over the table felt particularly obscene.
<br><br>
Charmaine kept her eyes fixed on the tablecloth, unwilling to make eye contact with Stanley or the cook. Her palms were damp and slippery with sweat as she tried to secure the corners of the tablecloth. Each movement seemed to drag on forever, her muscles trembling with exertion and shame. Meanwhile, Stanley watched with keen interest, his eyes following her every move. He couldn't resist adding another challenge, knowing it would drive her to her limits.
<br><br>
"We forgot the salt and pepper!" he exclaimed suddenly, prompting Charmaine to glance up at him. His smirk told her all she needed to know. Stanley had set her up, once again placing her in an incredibly awkward position. Without giving herself time to think, Charmaine hurried over to the cupboard where the salt and pepper shakers were stored. She knew she could not reach them, and would have to climb on a small stool to retrieve them.
<br><br>
Reluctantly, she took a deep breath and climbed onto the stool, her bare legs and her naked bottom exposed for Stanley's perusal. The kitchen boy even had the temerity to kneel on the floor as if picking up something, so he could get a better view from below. Her heart pounded as she reached upwards, her delicate fingers just able to grasp the salt shaker. However, as she attempted to pull it down, the shaker slipped through her trembling fingers, falling to the floor with a loud clatter."You can clean this up later," Mrs. Atkinson interrupted. "You still need to pull all chairs around the table first." Charmaine's heart sunk - hauling the heavy wooden chairs from their place near the wall was a difficult task.
<br><br>
Beads of sweat formed on her forehead as she pulled the first chair, struggling to keep her balance. Each chair she moved seemed heavier than the last, making her feel more and more defeated. Stanley watched her with an amused grin, clearly reveling in her discomfort.
<br><br>
As Charmaine wrestled with the final heavy chair, her muscles screamed in protest, the veins in her neck standing out prominently. With great effort, she managed to slide the chair across the smooth wooden floor. Her face was flushed with exertion and embarrassment as she straightened up, feeling as though she were carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. Mrs. Atkinson watched quietly, making sure Charmaine didn't forget any further step in setting up the table. "Here, put the cutlery on the table," she said.
<br><br>
"Everyone will be here in a minute," Mrs. Atkinson added, her voice laced with a hint of impatience. Charmaine's heart raced as she scrambled to arrange the knives, forks, and spoons on the table, trying her best to hide her trembling hands. Stanley watched with undisguised delight, his gaze roaming all over her exposed body. His lewd laughter rang out as he commented, "Hurry up, Charmaine, we don't want to miss anything. It's almost 9am"
<br><br>
Charmaine's face reddened, her anger mixed with humiliation.
<br><br>
"And do not forget the salt you spilled earlier, clean it up now," the cook demanded.
<br><br>
Charmaine set to work immediately. She could hear murmurs and footsteps as her fellow staff members approached the kitchen. Sweat poured down her forehead, and her legs trembled beneath her. Tears threatened to fall as she realized there was nothing to shield her vulnerability. Thus it was that when the first servants entered the kitchen, they were confronted with Charmaine's naked backside, bent from her waist, scooping up the last remnants of the salt in haste. The men froze in their steps as, holding a brush in one hand a dust pan in the other, she got up and slowly turned to face them.
<br><br>
"Do not mind Charmaine," Mrs. Atkinson quickly intervened. "Mr. Paine has found it necessary to punish her - in an unusual manner, I grant you, but who are we to question him? You know he has the full confidence of Sir Richard. So, just do not mind her and continue as before."
<br><br>
The male staff members exchanged glances, their faces registering a mixture of shock and eager expectation. Some nodded in understanding, while others shot long piercing glances at Charmaine, their eyes traveling all over her body. They sat down one by one, taking their places around the table. The kitchen boy, eager to contribute to Charmaine's misery, made sure to sit closest to her, smirking as he took his seat. Charmaine's cheeks burned crimson as she looked around, realizing the attention was firmly on her.
<br><br>
"Serve the tea now, girl, do not just sit there," ordered the cook.
<br><br>
Charmaine's hands shook as she got up and reached for the teapot, walking around the table and pouring steaming liquid into cups lined up before her. The sound of steam escaping the teapot seemed to echo the thumping of her heart.
<br><br>
Each step around the table was filled with the fear of tripping and falling, exposing herself even more. Every sip of tea taken by the staff felt as yet another piece of her humiliation. Her face flushed with each word spoken, her body trembling with anxiety. She was also acutely aware that, with everyone sitting and her walking around the table to serve the tea, their eyes were at the level of her exposed intimate parts. She noticed that even some of the female staff members seemed fascinated by her predicament, their eyes lingering on her body.
<br><br>
Her face was burning hot with the acute embarrassment; however Charmaine had no choice but to go on. She continued to serve the tea, her movements more careful than ever. She felt her every action intently scrutinized, and her cheeks grew increasingly warm.
<br><br>
Her heart hammered in her chest, fear and shame coursing through her veins. As she served tea to the other servants, she could sense their fascination, many of them unable to take their eyes off her. She noticed Stanley's eyes were fixated on her as well, relishing her discomfort. Her skin felt like it was on fire, and her legs quivered beneath her.
<br><br>
Finally, she took her own place at the table, the coldness of the wooden chair a small shock on her bare bottom.
<br><br>
Her gaze dropped instinctively to her lap, her cheeks growing hotter still.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the kitchen became strained, silence broken only by the clinking of cups and the occasional cough. The tension in the room was palpable, an invisible force pressing against the walls. The cook watched Charmaine with quiet judgement.
<br><br>
As Charmaine took her first tentative sip of tea, she realized with horror that it was scalding hot. She quickly lowered the cup, her cheeks flaring in embarrassment. Mrs. Atkinson, seemingly oblivious to the discomfort radiating from Charmaine, directed everyone's attention to the food. "Today's breakfast includes muffins, eggs, bacon, and sausage."
<br><br>
While the staff began eating, Charmaine tried to concentrate on her own meal, desperately attempting to ignore the scrutiny and snide comments of her co-workers. Grateful that at least part of her body was hidden from view for a while, she picked at her food fully aware that, even so, her full breasts were still on display.
<br><br>
She caught the occasional disapproving look from some of the older staff members. But she was also aware that, despite their disapproval, they too couldn't help looking at her, their curiosity and fascination overpowering their judgment.
<br><br>
Stanley's amusement was evident in his mocking glances at Charmaine, enjoying her discomfort and confusion. She could see other staff members stifling their giggles, their eyes wandering towards her, betraying their amusement.
<br><br>
Charmaine's cheeks burned scarlet, and she bit her lip hard, trying to suppress her tears. She couldn't bear the humiliation much longer, the constant stares and whispers breaking her spirit. Despite the heat from the scalding tea, she couldn't focus on it, her mind filled with turmoil.
<br><br>
Mrs. Atkinson finally broke the silence. "What is wrong with our young lady today?" she asked, a faint smile playing on her lips.
<br><br>
Her eyes met Charmaine's with an unmistakable glimmer of amusement. The younger woman's face flushed with embarrassment as she felt everyone's eyes boring into her.
<br><br>
Charmaine tried to maintain her composure, but the pressure was building within her. She knew that sooner or later, she would snap under the weight of their scrutiny. "It's just, Mr. Paine gave me quite a challenging task," she replied, hoping to deflect attention away from her predicament.
<br><br>
Mrs. Atkinson raised an eyebrow at Charmaine's response, a subtle hint that she wasn't entirely convinced. "Yes, that is true, dear," she replied, her tone gentle yet probing. "Perhaps, you might find it easier if you took a break to get dressed during your shift?"
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed, her face bright red with embarrassment. She knew she couldn't keep working like this without causing scandal. She hesitated for a moment, then mustered up her courage and replied, "Yes, Mrs. Atkinson? Can I do that?"
<br><br>
"I will ask Mr. Paine about his thoughts on the matter when I see him. After all, he said nothing about how long you are supposed to stay like this."Charmaine felt her hopes sink.
<br><br>
She knew it would be difficult to convince Mr. Paine to change his mind. Still, she forced a brave smile and nodded. "Of course, Mrs. Atkinson. Thank you."
<br><br>
The staff continued eating their breakfast, but the air remained tense. Many of the staff members had been eyeing Charmaine throughout the meal, and her discomfort was plain to see. Stanley's amusement grew as he observed her, enjoying her obvious distress.
<br><br>
He whispered something to another kitchen boy, who laughed and looked Charmaine up and down. The other servants started their daily conversations. Their laughter rang out across the kitchen, filling the air with an unsettling feeling of excitement.
<br><br>
Feeling completely helpless, Charmaine finished her meal, her cheeks still burning with embarrassment. She took a deep breath, determined to remain strong in the face of this indignity. She wanted nothing more than to be able to retreat to her room, where she could finally find some solace.
<br><br>
After breakfast, the kitchen staff returned to their usual tasks, but the air remained charged with unease. Stanley, clearly emboldened by his peers' amusement, began devising new ways to make Charmaine squirm and remind her of her nudity. He had been told by the cook to keep Charmaine occupied, and he dove into the task with relish.He first assigned her the job of scrubbing the floors, where she would constantly worry about bending over or crawling on the floor on all fours, thus exposing herself further. Stanley always contrived to pick a position for himself behind her, looking at her exposed backside and even occasionally getting a glimpse of something more. He also enjoyed the side view of her wobbling breasts, as she vigorously scrubbed the floor with a stiff brush, covering every small area of floor he pointed to her as needing more attention.  Stanley delighted in watching her struggle and her humiliation grow with each small task he devised. Mrs. Atkinson feigned ignorance to Charmaine's plight, though her occasional glances revealed that she appreciated the spectacle as well. Charmaine's despair only deepened as she realized that the more she struggled, the greater the humiliation she faced.
<br><br>
Stanley appeared to revel in this suffering, taking sadistic pleasure in making her work harder while exposing her vulnerability. He could scarcely wait for her to finish scrubbing the floor before he came up with the next task. He led her to a closet in a nearby passage and told her to open it. On a high shelf there were dozens of old shoes.
<br><br>
Stanley told Charmaine that she needed to clean and polish these shoes so they could be worn again. He stood behind her as she climbed onto a low stool to reach the highest shoe. The smell of old leather and dust mixed together, creating a pungent odor that made Charmaine's nose wrinkle. Stanley instructed her to take all the shoes out into the courtyard and to dust them thoroughly with a soft cloth, then polish each pair to ensure that they were sparkling clean. His eyes lingered on her figure as she bent over, hands delicately holding the old shoes.
<br><br>
His voice dripped with malice as he taunted her, saying, "Make sure you clean each shoe properly, Charmaine. We wouldn't want any dirt left behind now, would we?" The other kitchen boys chuckled, their gazes fixed on her, making her blush even deeper.
<br><br>
Stanley's cruelty seemed to know no bounds. He insisted on inspecting each shoe personally, relishing in her frustration and embarrassment as he often found imaginary flaws, forcing her to start over. His taunting only fueled her determination to complete the task efficiently, but she soon realized it was futile; no matter how diligently she worked, Stanley would find fault with her efforts. The other kitchen boys joined in, laughing and pointing at her exposed body, making the situation even more humiliating. Charmaine struggled to hold back tears, fighting the urge to cover herself from their prying eyes.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a shadow loomed over Charmaine.
<br><br>
She looked up, only to find Mr. Paine standing above her, his cold eyes surveying her every movement. Seeing her, he smiled, a sinister grin spreading across his face.
<br><br>
"So, my little maid, it seems you have encountered some difficulties during your punishment," he remarked, his voice dripping with satisfaction. "Is it not a challenge, having to perform all these tasks while being so... unclothed?"
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart raced, fearful of what Mr. Paine might decide.
<br><br>
Trembling, she replied, "Yes, sir." Her voice wavered, conveying her fear and despair. Mr. Paine stared at her for a moment, his eyes boring into hers. With a leering smile, he declared, "I have just received some good news. Well, it is good for me. Not so good for you, I would say."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank as Mr. Paine's words struck her like a blow. The prospect of facing more time in this humiliating state loomed large before her.
<br><br>
"Sir Richard has gone to London for a week, leaving me in charge," the butler said. "And Lady Constance has gone with him too, so there will be nobody to voice any objections to this little... hm... object lesson I have decided to give you. Strictly for your own future benefit, of course."
<br><br>
His grin widened, and Charmaine shivered at the sight. "You will continue your tasks naked for the whole week, Charmaine. To reinforce the importance of taking your duties seriously."
<br><br>
Charmaine's world crumbled around her as the reality of her situation dawned on her. This meant that she would have to endure another week without clothes, forced to deal with the constant stares and humiliation.
<br><br>
The thought of continuing to work without clothes felt almost unbearable. As she processed this terrible news, she could hear the murmurs of the other kitchen staff, reveling in her misfortune.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine, ever the consummate master, watched her reaction closely, savoring her despair. "Now, my dear, don't look so distraught. You should consider this an opportunity to learn a valuable lesson which will do you much good during your future employment at The Manor." His eyes glinted malevolently, and Charmaine wondered if there was anything worse than this experience.
<br><br>
"It did not escape me when I gave you that spanking, that you were much more troubled by your naked body being exposed than by the strap. So, you are getting a treatment which you can more fully appreciate."
<br><br>
How could the man be so cruel, Charmaine wondered. How could he force her to suffer this way? But she knew it was futile to question him. Instead, she steeled herself, vowing to somehow survive this ordeal.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 3 [DEO CO TIEU DE kkk!] ===</span></div><br><br>
Monday is a Long Day...
<br><br>
Compared to breakfast, lunch was relatively uneventful.
<br><br>
While the staff enjoyed the meal, Charmaine tried to avoid eye contact with anyone whenever possible. She couldn't help but notice that even during their conversation, many of the staff continued to steal furtive glances at her, undoubtedly still entertained by her predicament.
<br><br>
As she finished clearing away the dishes after lunch, she caught a glimpse of Stanley, the kitchen boy who had taken such delight in tormenting her earlier.
<br><br>
His gaze bore into her, a mix of curiosity and anticipation, causing her skin to crawl. She quickly turned away, determined not to let him affect her further.
<br><br>
It was not to be, though. Stanley was given the task of keeping her busy, and he would not give it up for anything in the world.
<br><br>
He had already pushed her limits, and now he was eager to see what else he could get her to do. "I think there is no more to do in the kitchen until dinner time," he said. "Let us check out the court yard and see what needs to be done there."
<br><br>
As Charmaine stepped out into the sunlit courtyard, she sighed deeply, trying to steel herself against the fresh humiliations awaiting her. The bright rays warmed her skin, contrasting sharply with the cool breeze that rustled through the branches of the few bushes growing near the wall, its feeling against her bare skin reminding her of her nudity.  She felt it even sharper than before, now in the open.
<br><br>
Stanley eyed her with a mischievous glint in his eye, clearly excited by the thought of continuing to exploit her. "Well, what shall we do here, Charmaine?" he asked mockingly. "We can begin by cleaning those benches." He gestured towards the wooden benches placed near the door and around the yard.
<br><br>
There were bird droppings on them, along with various leaves and twigs. "I suggest you use a brush and a bucket of water to clean them. It shouldn't take too long," he added nonchalantly.
<br><br>
With a heavy heart, Charmaine returned to the kitchen searching for a suitable brush and bucket of water. These were not hard to find, as most of the other housemaids had used the same tools earlier. As she dipped the brush into the bucket, she took a deep breath, bracing herself for what lay ahead.
<br><br>
As she began scrubbing, the bristles of the brush met the wooden surface, the rough sound echoing throughout the court yard.
<br><br>
Charmaine moved methodically, focusing intently on her task to avoid thinking about the discomfort of being naked not only in public, but also out in the open. Despite her best efforts, however, she couldn't ignore the stares of the other servants who passed by, stopping briefly to watch her work. Their expressions varied from curiosity to fascination, adding to her mortification.
<br><br>
As Charmaine scrubbed, her mind raced with thoughts of escaping this horrendous situation. How could she get out of it? Or was she doomed to endure this torturous existence for the entire week?
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Stanley and the other kitchen boys lingered around the court yard, eagerly watching her struggle. They laughed among themselves, enjoying their power over her vulnerability. "Look at that," one of them said, pointing at Charmaine's exposed back.
<br><br>
"A housemaid working without clothes. That must be quite liberating!" Another chimed in, his voice laced with sarcasm. "It doesn't seem to bother her too much."
<br><br>
Charmaine focused on the task at hand, scrubbing the benches as vigorously as she could, ignoring the mockery coming from the boys nearby. Finally, all the benches were spotless.
<br><br>
However, Stanley wasn't ready to release her yet. "Now, there's something else that needs your attention," he announced, sauntering towards the storage shed. Charmaine followed him, hoping desperately that he wouldn't require her to enter the enclosed space.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, her fears were confirmed as Stanley pointed inside, saying, "You need to sweep away the spider webs and dust inside. Make sure everything is clean." The other kitchen boys snickered, their eyes gleaming with malicious intent.
<br><br>
Charmaine hesitated, her heart pounding wildly in her chest. Was there no escape from this nightmare?
<br><br>
Entering the storage shed, Charmaine found herself swallowed by darkness. The air was thick with the smell of dust. The single source of light was the open door.
<br><br>
Despite the gloom, Charmaine could see the webs clinging to the walls and ceiling. She reached for the broom, grasping the handle tightly. Slowly, she advanced into the darkened space, her skin prickling with apprehension.
<br><br>
The cold air of the shed seemed to creep along her flesh, making her shiver. She felt the broomstick's handle in her grasp, reassuring herself that she had something to defend herself with if necessary. Her eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness, allowing her to better navigate the area.
<br><br>
She proceeded carefully, stepping over old wooden boxes and piles of tools. The sounds of laughter from the kitchen boys outside only served to increase her anxiety. She started clearing the spider webs first, which seemed to have been undisturbed for years.
<br><br>
With every swipe of the broom, cobwebs fell to the floor, revealing layers upon layers of dust and grime accumulated over time. Even though the shed was cold, she soon warmed up and begun sweating from the vigorous exertion. She often had to stretch on her toes, trying to reach the ceiling with the tip of the broom, aware of the boys jostling for a better viewing position behind the door.
<br><br>
Eventually, the webs were cleared and it was turn for the shelves to be cleaned.
<br><br>
The sight of the dust-covered boxes filled Charmaine with dread. However, she forced herself to face the task, fetching a cloth and a bucket of water from the kitchen under the rapt gazes of the kitchen boys. With steady hands, she wiped down the dusty surfaces, exposing layer upon layer of the past.
<br><br>
She had to shift the heavy boxes around in order to clean properly, and then move them back. She was now sweating profusely; her sweat trickled down her bare skin, forming muddy paths through the sticky dust which now covered her all over.
<br><br>
She felt the goosebumps rise on her skin, and her nipples turned into little rocks. This did not escape the notice of the boys when she finally walked towards the door to take the bucket of dirty water out.
<br><br>
Stanley pointed to her breasts in awe. "Your poor nipples must be so cold!", he said mockingly.
<br><br>
Charmaine was mortified, her intimate body parts under not only constant scrutiny but now also being the subject of crude comments. Unable to respond, she kept her head down and made her way back to the kitchen with the dirty water.
<br><br>
It only remained now to clean the floor of the shed.
<br><br>
The floor was covered in dust and grime from years of neglect. Taking the broom once again, Charmaine approached the task with determination. With each stroke of the broom, she could feel the gritty dirt beneath her feet. Clouds of dust rose in the air, much of it sticking to her damp skin.
<br><br>
Charmaine's labored breathing filled the silence of the shed. The rhythmic movements of the broomstick scraping across the floor were the only sounds breaking the eerie quiet. With each stroke, she cleared another patch of the floor, leaving behind visible tracks of dirt and debris. Her hands trembled slightly from exhaustion, and she knew that she was close to finishing the arduous task. Stanley did not miss the opportunity though to add a further indignity. "Look under the lowest shelves," he said. "There might be some dirt hiding there."
<br><br>
Charmaine bent down to investigate, feeling the cool draft flow through the shed. When she saw the small pile of dust hidden beneath the first shelf, she sighed inwardly. She knew that no bit of dirt would pass unnoticed by Stanley and the other boys.
<br><br>
Picking up the broom once again, she swung it vigorously beneath the shelf. As Stanley had intended though, she had to go down on all fours to be able to reach all the way to the wall.
<br><br>
The roughness of the floor pressed against her knees, her fingers grazing the baseboards, and her cheek resting against the coarse wood of the shelf. The act of sweeping brought up an assortment of debris - fragments of broken glass, rusted nails, and even bits of paper.
<br><br>
Stanley adjusted his position so he could observe from behind the obscene spectacle she was presenting, her bottom high in the air, her legs parted widely. Charmaine was beyond feeling the mortification now. She just wished to be done with this task and out of the shed.
<br><br>
As she continued her laborious work, Stanley's leering voice pierced the stillness of the shed. "Just look at her, on her hands and knees like that. "
<br><br>
Stanley laughed, pointing at Charmaine's exposed backside. "And she doesn't even mind we can see her like this!" His friends joined in, sniggering at her predicament.
<br><br>
Charmaine's face burned hot with embarrassment, her heart pounding in her chest. She tried to ignore the mocking voices, focusing instead on the task at hand. As she brushed the remaining dust and debris from the floor, her fingers curled around the broomstick.
<br><br>
It was almost dusk when she finally pushed herself to her and feet Stanley acknowledged that the shed was spotlessly clean, as it had never been since it was built.
<br><br>
As Charmaine stepped out, her eyes slowly adjusted to the brighter surroundings. She glanced around, feeling the heat of the day's last sun rays bearing down on her sweaty skin. Her arms ached from the relentless work of cleaning. She looked down on her bare skin with horror. It was grimy beyond belief.
<br><br>
"You cannot go into the house like this," smirked Stanley. "And we cannot draw you a proper bath either". The other boys laughed out at his witty remark. "What are we going to do with you then?" asked Stanley, his tone dripping with sarcasm.
<br><br>
The other kitchen boys began to discuss amongst themselves, debating various options. One jokingly suggested dragging her to the lake, where they could wash her off in the shallows. The other thought it would be more amusing to put her in the garden pond.
<br><br>
Charmaine stood helplessly, her cheeks burning red with humiliation. She was caught in a trap with no way out.
<br><br>
The laughter grew louder and the suggestions ever more fanciful, and Charmaine felt panic rising in her throat. After enduring hours of physical labor and humiliation, it appeared that she might not escape yet another ordeal.
<br><br>
Desperate for any way out, Charmaine couldn't help but plead with the boys. "Please, I don't want to go into the lake or the garden pond. Can't you think of anything else?"
<br><br>
Stanley, who clearly enjoyed playing puppet master, feigned consideration before answering, "Hmm, perhaps you should clean yourself as best you can right here. Being helpful and friendly, we will assist as we can, won't we, boys?" Stanley suggested, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "We can even make it enjoyable!"
<br><br>
Charmaine felt her stomach drop, her limbs growing weak. She was sure that the enjoyment was not going to be for her.
<br><br>
However, the other kitchen boys quickly jumped onto the project.
<br><br>
"Fetch a bucket of water from the kitchen, Charmaine!", one of them ordered.
<br><br>
Charmaine could only nod, too exhausted and humiliated to argue. The bucket of water was placed at her feet, the boys crowding around as she knelt beside it. She hesitated for a moment, looking around at the faces of the laughing boys surrounding her. Feeling defeated, she leaned forward and plunged her hands into the cold water, splashing it onto her face and arms, the boys watching her every move intently. Soon, the bucket was empty but she was nowhere near clean. "We haven't got all day," Stanley proclaimed. "Bring another bucket, and a ladle."
<br><br>
Charmaine obeyed, keenly aware of their eyes on her as she was walking towards the house, and on her way back bent under the weight of the full bucket.
<br><br>
"Stand here now," the boy commanded, pointing towards the centre of the court yard. "And lift your hands up."
<br><br>
"You have all seen how they wash the horses, right?", he addressed his mates. "We have no brushes or cloths, so we'll have to make do with our bare hands, though." Stanley explained, drawing giggles from his comrades. "We can take turns with the ladle!"
<br><br>
When she felt the first ladle of cold water drop on her skin, it sent shivers through her and Charmaine shrieked with the surprise. The boys erupted into laughter, and Stanley told them to continue. They took turns ladling water onto her, with one boy pouring the water while the other two vigorously scrubbed her body with their bare hands. They were so engrossed in the activity that they did not even send her for more water, instead taking turns to fetch new buckets themselves.
<br><br>
Charmaine had no strength left to even protest when they pushed her legs apart and started vigorously rubbing between them too.
<br><br>
She could hear their raucous laughter and feel their eager hands working her skin up and down, everywhere, the cold water meanwhile turning her into a shivering mess.
<br><br>
At long last, they had to admit she was clean when it was time for dinner and all the other staff were already around the table.
<br><br>
All conversation stopped and all eyes were fixed on her when Charmaine entered the kitchen, naked, covered in goosebumps, the nipples of her full breasts rock-hard.
<br><br>
The heat of the stove radiated through the kitchen, and Charmaine nearly ran to it, desperately seeking warmth. She stood huddled in front of the stove, shivering violently, while trying to cover herself as best she could with her hands. Her hair fell over her shoulders in damp strands, and she clutched it tightly in her grasp.
<br><br>
Stanley, the instigator of her humiliation, drew a chair for her at the table and invited her to sit with a mocking bow.
<br><br>
"Sit down, Charmaine, join us for dinner." he said, with a leer that made her stomach turn.
<br><br>
The other kitchen boys watched her walk towards the table, their eyes assessing her as she passed. Everyone in the room had noticed her arrival, and the whispers spread rapidly throughout the household. The maids, cooks, and other servants stared in disbelief, but no one confronted the kitchen boys about their behavior.
<br><br>
Feeling acutely aware of the prying eyes, Charmaine sat at the table, her skin crawling.
<br><br>
She pulled her legs close together and wrapped her arms around her torso, hoping to provide some semblance of modesty. The others at the table remained silent, the tension palpable.
<br><br>
The cook, Mrs. Atkinson, indicated it was time to eat.
<br><br>
With great effort, Charmaine forced herself to focus on her food. She silently prayed for the meal to be over so she could return to the safety of her room. Her skin was still sensitive from the cold water, and she found it difficult to bear the sensation of the cold wooden chair against her flesh. Each mouthful she managed to take was an agony, knowing she was being observed as she ate. Her hands shook slightly as she held her fork, fearing it would betray her frailty.
<br><br>
Her gaze shifted to Stanley, the source of her misery. His dark eyes met hers, and his features contorted with amusement. With deliberate slowness, he picked up his fork and continued eating, casting a challenging glance in her direction.
<br><br>
Charmaine struggled to maintain her composure, focusing on eating her food. She knew that any reaction would only feed the malicious entertainment of these men and women.
<br><br>
When dinner was over, she quickly excused herself and fled the kitchen, avoiding joking suggestions to stay chat with the other maids, or to join a game of cards with the grooms.
<br><br>
Instead, she hastened back to her small room, grateful for its privacy. In her narrow bed at last, the feeling of the bed cloths against her bare skin reminded her of the feeling of being clothed, and she finally broke down in tears.
<br><br>
Thankfully, the exhaustion of the day overcame her, and soon Charmaine drifted into a dreamless sleep.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 4 [Laundry Day (Tuesday Morning)] ===</span></div><br><br>
The morning sun filtered through the windows of the laundry room, casting a warm light over the mess of dirty garments and sheets scattered throughout the room. The faint scent of mustiness permeated the air, along with the sharp tang of bleach and soap. Charmaine walked carefully among the piles of clothing and sheets, trying not to trip on something or miss her step on the slippery tiles. Her feet were cold against the stone floor, and she wished she had some footwear. Not to mention some clothes...
<br><br>
She had endured another humiliating breakfast with all the household servants, almost breaking down in tears as she stood in front of them stark naked. It had been difficult to maintain eye contact with anyone, let alone engage in conversation. Her mortification intensified when Stanley approached her once more, asking her to clear away the used plates and utensils. He grinned, obviously enjoying her discomfort. As Charmaine attempted to gather the items, especially where she had to lean and stretch her body to get them from the center of the large table, she found her hands trembling with anxiety. The other servants stared at her, and she could feel their amusement radiating through the room. Stanley taunted her, saying, "Make sure you collect everything, Charmaine. And hurry up. I hope you did not forget we have laundry day today."
<br><br>
Charmaine winced. With all the excitement of the previous day, she had indeed forgotten all about it being laundry day today. This involved hours of grueling labor, involving lifting heavy tubs full of water, scrubbing stained clothes and bed sheets, and dealing with the wet, slippery floors. She summoned the strength she had left and continued picking up the plates one by one, trying her best to ignore the smirks and whispers of the other servants.
<br><br>
Every inch of her skin seemed to burn under their scrutiny, and she swore she could feel the heat from their leering gazes. After carefully placing all the plates in the large kitchen sink, she turned to the silverware, collecting it all on a large tray. Each fork, knife, and spoon she picked up was a struggle, her fingers aching from clenching them too tightly in the process.
<br><br>
She heard a polite cough behind her.
<br><br>
Turning, she saw James, the footman, giving her a knowing glance. The corners of his mouth twitched upwards slightly, as if he was suppressing laughter. Charmaine couldn't help but feel a wave of dread wash over her.
<br><br>
James was the footman she had seen watching her intently from afar several times during her first weeks in the manor. His presence filled her with unease, causing her heart to race. She tried her best to ignore him, focusing on collecting the last few silverware pieces from the table. When she finished, she carried the tray to the sink, her arms straining under the weight. She felt James' eyes follow her every move, his desires growing clearer by the second.
<br><br>
Her breath quickened, and she became increasingly aware of her vulnerability. James smiled at Charmaine, his eyes roaming leisurely over her bare body. She could feel the heat emanating from his stare, and it only served to heighten her sense of vulnerability. The anticipation built within her, and her breath quickened as he approached her. She closed her eyes briefly, steeling herself for whatever was about to happen.
<br><br>
"Mr. Paine told me you might need some help from a strong man and not just the kitchen boys today," James snickered. "Seeing that you will be helping with the laundry. Let's go upstairs and get the bed sheets from all the servant rooms first."
<br><br>
James gestured towards the door leading out of the kitchen. "It would make our work much easier if we collected all the dirty bed sheets at once before getting to the rest of the laundry." Charmaine hesitated, unsure whether to trust James. His suggestion seemed innocent enough, but the thought of him potentially taking advantage of her vulnerable state made her wary. However, her better judgment told her that she needed all the help she could get. After all, she didn't want to anger Mr. Paine any further. Taking a deep breath, she nodded reluctantly.
<br><br>
With a nod, James gestured towards the stairs, allowing her to go first. Aware of the spectacle she was presenting before his gaze, Charmaine hurriedly ascended the staircase, her bare feet feeling cold on the bare wooden steps. Following close behind, James couldn't resist a moment of admiration as he witnessed her long, strong legs moving swiftly upward. Once they reached the top of the stairs, James led her down the hallway towards the servant quarters. Charmaine kept her head down, trying to avoid making eye contact with him. Her heart raced with both fear and apprehension as she realized how precarious her position was.
<br><br>
As they moved through the dimly lit corridors, the atmosphere felt thick with tension. Charmaine was grateful for the warmth of the bed sheets as they gathered them from each room and put them out in the corridor, though her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. It pained her to imagine what the other servants must think of her, exposed like this, acting so subservient, walking naked in this common environment.
<br><br>
"You're going to need something to carry these with," James suggested casually, his eyes gleaming with interest.
<br><br>
Charmaine paused, contemplating his words. There was no telling what kind of trouble she could get into if she refused his assistance. Nodding hesitantly, she walked in front of James back to the laundry room, unable to shake the feeling that she was walking straight into some trap.
<br><br>
Upon reaching the laundry room, James went off to fetch a large cloth bag he knew would suffice for carrying the sheets. Meanwhile, Charmaine waited nervously, attempting to regain her composure and ignore the rising anxiety churning within her.
<br><br><br><br>
She desperately wanted to finish this task quickly and escape the humiliating situation. James returned with the bag, handing it to her wordlessly. He took his time observing her as she walked back up the stairs, and carefully placed the sheets inside the bag one by one walking down the corridor, her face flushing as she became more aware of his attention as she was bending down for each sheet.
<br><br>
Gathering up all the sheets with a mixture of relief and embarrassment, Charmaine struggled to lift the full bag which had become quite heavy. Wordlessly, James lifted it and then placed it on her head, forcing her to steady it on both sides with her hands.Her shoulders and arms strained under its weight, and she struggled to walk without tripping. Every step sounded loudly in the otherwise silent hallway, amplifying her humiliation. James followed closely behind, offering occasional suggestions and helping to steady the bag. As she reached the stairs, he moved in front of her, walking a couple of stairs down until his eyes were level with her most intimate parts.
<br><br>
His proximity was excruciatingly powerful, and her breath caught in her throat. He looked up at her face, his eyes glinting with desire.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart began to pound wildly in her chest. James brought his gaze back down again and stared intently for an embarrassingly long time, before finally he turned and walked down the stairs.
<br><br>
As she reached the bottom of the stairs, they turned to the laundry room, where he held the bottom of the bag for her, allowing her to carefully lower it down, grateful for the respite from its weight. Slowly, she untied the cloth bag, letting the sheets fall onto the ground. Despite her relief, she couldn't help but feel a renewed wave of anxiety as she looked around, suddenly aware of the fact that they were entirely alone in the laundry room.
<br><br>
James' eyes narrowed, and his lips curved into a smile. "Do not worry, little Charmaine," he said. "Mr. Paine has instructed all the male servants in the household - even the kitchen boys - that nobody is to touch you. He will suffer no impropriety in the house, he said. Ha-ha."
<br><br>
Charmaine forced a laugh, her voice wavering with anxiety. She wished she could believe him, but the tone of his voice worried her.
<br><br>
As they worked side by side, he made idle conversation about trivial matters, but his eyes never left her, and Charmaine couldn't shake the feeling that he was toying with her. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of water sloshing in the large tub and the soft slap of wet fabric against fabric. In moments of brief respite, she stole furtive glances at James, her eyes brimming with uncertainty.
<br><br>
Despite her misgivings, she was grateful for his guidance when it came to cleaning the various garments. He showed surprising knowledge as he demonstrated different techniques for handling stains and rinsing away grime, and she found herself absorbing the knowledge with a mix of gratitude and curiosity.
<br><br>
James' instructional demeanor, however, did little to assuage her uneasiness. At every turn, his eyes flickered from her hands to her figure, and his mannerisms often verged on predatory. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to his attentiveness than just teaching her the ropes. She had no practical experience with men, being still unmarried, but she well knew the significance of the now permanent large bulge in the front of his trousers.
<br><br>
Even as he guided her through the intricacies of handling delicate fabrics, she sensed his intentions were far from honorable. His eyes constantly swept over her body, leaving her feeling increasingly vulnerable.
<br><br>
Charmaine grew anxious as the morning wore on. The air in the laundry room had grown thick with tension, and the silence felt almost palpable. James, too, appeared increasingly impatient.
<br><br>
His eyes darted from her face to her bare chest and then further down, conveying a simmering desire. Charmaine's heart hammered wildly in her chest, and she fought hard to maintain her composure. It felt an eternity until two of the older maids walked in and said they would take over from there.
<br><br>
"Let's go out in the sun, shall we?" James proposed, his voice low and heavy with an intention Charmaine did not understand. She hesitated, torn between her instinctual mistrust of him and her desperate need for help. Reluctantly, she agreed, following him out of the laundry room.
<br><br>
They exited the chamber into the brightly lit courtyard, giving James a much better view of the nude maid.
<br><br>
He watched her move towards a nearby bench, careful not to look too interested, but Charmaine could tell from the gleam in his eyes that he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He followed her lead, seating himself across from her on the other bench. She was acutely aware of his gaze focused between her legs. She tried to sit modestly, but James said:
<br><br>
"Relax, Charmaine. You can't work properly if you are so tense. Here, let me help you." She could scarcely believe it when he got up from his bench, then knelt in front of her, lifted her left foot from the ground and placed it on the bench, and then proceeded to do the same with her right foot. She was now sitting on the bench with her legs wide open, feet next to her bare bottom on the seat.
<br><br>
James slowly sat back on the other bench, his eyes all the time firmly glued between her legs. "We are not allowed to touch, Charmaine. But a man still likes to look, and I think you owe me something for all the help I have been giving you, don't you think?"
<br><br>
James' eyes smoldered with lust as he spoke. Charmaine swallowed, feeling trapped. She understood that refusing his advances might cost her dearly, so she decided to play along. Nervously, she nodded her agreement.
<br><br>
"Good girl," James purred, reaching out and lightly stroking her thigh, sending a shiver down her spine.
<br><br>
"Now, since you owe me something, why don't you show some more appreciation?"
<br><br>
Charmaine hesitated, unsure of what he meant.
<br><br>
"It's simple, my dear," he continued, his voice taking on a strange edge. "Just give me a small favor in return."
<br><br>
Feeling trapped and desperate, Charmaine reluctantly agreed. She wasn't sure what she was getting herself into, but she had no choice but to comply.
<br><br>
With a gleam in his eye, James stood up from the bench and slowly approached her.
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed, feeling an odd mix of fear and anticipation as he towered over her. Her heart raced, and her breath quickened as he leaned down close to her ear. "I like you, Charmaine," he whispered, his hot breath causing goosebumps to rise on her skin. Unable to resist or refuse, Charmaine hesitated, trying to find the courage to comply.
<br><br>
Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes, bracing herself for whatever lay ahead.
<br><br>
James' fingers grazed her cheek, his touch light yet insistent. Her heart raced, and her skin prickled with excitement and apprehension.
<br><br>
Slowly, Charmaine opened her eyes and looked up at James, her gaze bold and defiant despite her trembling knees. He smiled knowingly, his dark eyes sparkling with amusement. Unsure of what else to do, she leaned forward and felt his lips press against hers, tentatively at first.
<br><br>
His mouth opened, and his tongue sought hers, invading her mouth with a hunger that matched her own sudden, unexpected, desire. She could taste the lingering essence of tea on his lips, and it mixed his own musky scent, making her head spin.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he stood up. "Much as I want to, I cannot continue," he said. "This household is my life, and having me sent away because I broke Mr. Paine's order will destroy me."
<br><br>
Charmaine was confused, unsure whether to be relieved or frustrated. "There will be plenty of opportunities in the future," James said. "We should get back to work." They got up and turned toward the house, just as Mr. Paine walked out in their direction.
<br><br>
James' expression blanched momentarily, but he quickly regained his composure.
<br><br>
He offered a slight bow to Mr. Paine to excuse himself; surprisingly though, the butler pulled him to the side for a whispered conversation before James proceeded into the house.
<br><br>
Charmaine stood rooted in place through this, a mixture of shock, confusion, and yearning filling her heart. She couldn't quite comprehend what had just transpired. Was it merely a game played by James? Or was there something more sinister beneath the surface? In any case, it was lucky that the butler had not walked out a moment earlier.
<br><br>
"Come with me, Charmaine," the butler commanded and walked back into the house.
<br><br>
Shaken and uncertain, Charmaine followed Mr. Paine's directions, stepping cautiously over the cold stone floors. As she moved further inside, she felt crushed by the magnitude of the situation she had found herself in. Little did she know that her situation would soon take a turn to the worse...<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 5 [Even More Exposure (Tuesday Afternoon)] ===</span></div><br><br>
Charmaine's anxiety increased as she realized that they were walking towards Mr. Paine's room, where he had given her a bare bottom spanking a couple of weeks before. His room was large and furnished much like a gentleman's study, not opulent but a long way above the furnishings in the quarters of the other staff.
<br><br>
Charmaine stood motionless before a tall mirror. Her reflection stared back at her, eyes wide with disbelief and horror. Was this how everyone saw her now? Her full breasts exposed, their nipples highlighted by the hardness caused by the chilly air, her long legs spread wide - revealing her most intimate areas for all to see, barely hidden by the short strands of her blonde pubic hair. Even though she tried to maintain some sense of dignity by covering her breasts with her arms, she knew that it was futile. She was helplessly exposed, and there was nothing she could do about it.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine paused by the doorway and observed Charmaine in the mirror. His eyes narrowed, and a wicked smile crept onto his face.
<br><br>
"Why do you cover your breasts, Charmaine?" he asked, his tone deceptively calm. "It is not as if I have not seen them already. Indeed, everyone in the household has. You have nothing to hide any more."
<br><br>
Charmaine trembled with humiliation as she realized the truth in what he said, unable to meet Mr. Paine's eyes.
<br><br>
"Everyone has seen everything already," Mr. Paine continued, his eyes burning with intent. "If you try to cover yourself again, I will personally ensure that your shameful display becomes permanent," he warned. Charmaine swallowed, fear coiling within her gut. She was trapped, cornered, with no hope of escape. She lowered her arms, exposing her breasts once more, unable to meet Mr. Paine's malevolent gaze.
<br><br>
There was a knock on the door, and the butler gestured for her to open it. To her surprise, James entered the room, his eyes raking over Charmaine's exposed form. "Yes, Mr. Paine?", he intoned, looking at the butler inquiringly.
<br><br>
"You see, James, I have some good news to deliver to Charmaine. Yes, my dear," he said turning towards her, "I am not all bad."
<br><br>
"But then, as so often happens, there is also some bad news to go with it. Well, when I say bad, it may be construed as such by yourself, Charmaine, but not by James, eh? Which is why I invited him here."
<br><br>
Mystified, they both looked at the butler, who continued.
<br><br>
"Upon reflection, I have decided that Charmaine's talents are under-appreciated as a mere helper in the kitchen, so I have decided to expand her duties. You may consider this as a small step up, Charmaine. You will now be given tasks in other parts of the household too."
<br><br>
Mr. Paine paused, allowing his words to sink in. "Your new duties will include cleaning rooms in the master's wing too, preparing the dining table and serving food to the family and their esteemed guests. This means you will be responsible for ensuring that everything looks impeccable and that the quality of the food and its presentation is up to the standards expected of this fine establishment."
<br><br>
Charmaine's eyes widened in surprise. A promotion? It seemed too good to be true, but at the same time, she sensed that there must be a catch.
<br><br>
And indeed, there was. "However, Charmaine," Mr. Paine continued, his smile growing colder, "there is one crucial detail to be arranged first."
<br><br>
She held her breath, her heart racing in trepidation. "And what might that be, sir?" she asked, trying to maintain her composure.
<br><br>
The butler paused, his gaze fixed on the are between her legs while he carefully searched for his next words. "It is not a topic normally discussed in polite society, but we need to discuss it here. The question, you see, is about the hair in your intimate area," he finally said. "It is unseemly, and I would even go so far as to say, indecent, to be parading it around the way you are." Charmaine choked on the unfairness of that statement. It was this man - this devil! who forced her to be parading it!
<br><br>
"In one word, it has to go. Which is why I called James here. I know he has occasionally done barber duty in the regiment, so he has experience in the matter. Seeing how you two became friends already, I am sure you will be happy for him to help you get rid of that hair."
<br><br>
"I have all the tools you need here, James," the butler said, opening a drawer near the mirror.
<br><br>
A small pair of scissors, razor, soap and brush were produced, as well as a large towel. The butler then exited the room, returning shortly with a basin of warm water.
<br><br>
James looked stunned. He walked over to Charmaine, reaching out to take hold of her right arm.
<br><br>
Gently but firmly, he guided her towards a nearby chair. Nervously, she sat down, feeling her heart thumping wildly in her chest. James watched her closely, admiring her vulnerability and beauty. With a mix of curiosity and desire, he couldn't help but feel aroused by the thought of performing this intimate task on Charmaine.
<br><br>
James looked down in consternation. "I am used to shaving men's beards, sir. When they sit on the chair, their beards are level with my hands. I don't think I can shave her in this position," James said, frowning slightly.
<br><br>
"Then bring her over to the table," Mr. Paine instructed sharply, after considering the conundrum for a minute.
<br><br>
Charmaine's cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she got off the chair and reluctantly approached the table. James helped her lie down on her back, her long legs stretched out in front of her, her hands gripping the sides. As she laid there, James felt his own pulse quicken with anticipation, his hands shaking slightly with excitement.
<br><br>
He took the pillow from the chair and placed it under her bottom, elevating her hips to allow easier access to her intimate areas. He moved closer to her, careful not to press against her, and began examining her body. He ran his fingers gently through her thick, soft blonde hair, tracing the outline of her mound and the gentle slope of her hip.
<br><br>
"Get on with it, James," Mr. Paine commanded, his voice echoing through the room.
<br><br>
James nodded, taking a deep breath to steady himself, and reached for the scissors. The metallic sound of the snipping blades filled the silence, sending shivers down Charmaine's spine. With precise movements, James then applied a layer of lather with the brush, and began shaving the delicate skin of her mound, his hand gently gliding along her tender flesh. Each stroke sent a wave of fear coursing through her veins, but she clenched her teeth together, determined not to show her vulnerability.
<br><br>
Despite her determination, she couldn't suppress a quiet gasp as James drew the razor ever closer to her sensitive folds. The blade grazed lightly against her skin, causing her to flinch involuntarily.
<br><br>
"Try to relax, Charmaine," James whispered gently, his hand hovering just above her entrance. "It will make it easier for me."
<br><br>
Despite her anxiety, Charmaine attempted to follow his advice, closing her eyes and taking slow, calming breaths.
<br><br>
The feeling of James' gentle touch on her exposed skin heightened her awareness of the intimacy of the situation. With each passing moment, her terror intensified, her heart pounding harder against her rib cage. The cold steel of the razor pressing against her delicate skin only served to amplify her fear.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine stood a few feet away, watching intently. His expression was a mixture of amusement and cruelty.
<br><br>
Charmaine gritted her teeth as James proceeded to shave the remaining hair. The razor slid smoothly across her skin, removing the last remnants of her innocence. He took extra care around her most sensitive areas, deliberately prolonging the process, his gaze never leaving the most intimate parts of her anatomy, his fingers pressing and gliding along skin no man had touched before.
<br><br>
Her face turned crimson with embarrassment as she imagined the thought of anyone seeing her like this. Tears threatened to overflow her eyes, but she fought back the urge to cry. Despite her discomfort, Charmaine maintained her composure, silently pleading with James to hurry up.
<br><br>
The butler stood nearby, watching with undisguised delight as Charmaine squirmed beneath James' attentions. Mr. Paine's eyes danced with malicious amusement, knowing full well the effect this humiliation would have on Charmaine.
<br><br>
As James finished his task, he pulled Charmaine up and led her to the mirror to inspect his work. She lifted her gaze hesitantly, looking at herself in horror. There was really no hiding now; every curve, line, and shadow was visible for all to see. Mortified, Charmaine stared at her reflection, feeling as though she was being violated all over again.
<br><br>
"Thank you, James, you can go now," the butler dismissed him brusquely.
<br><br>
James nodded respectfully and left the room, closing the door behind him.
<br><br>
Charmaine remained frozen in place, unable to move. Her entire body trembled as she struggled to regain control of her shattered dignity.
<br><br>
The butler watched her closely, smirking sadistically. "Don't worry, Charmaine. We'll ensure your performance improves to justify your promotion."
<br><br>
The butler added, his tone mockingly sweet. "I expect that your behavior should set an example to the rest of the staff. Especially the female ones."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, her stomach knotting in dread. What else could they possibly force her to do? "If I fail to meet these expectations, Mr. Paine, what then?" she asked quietly, her voice barely audible.
<br><br>
"Well, let's just say that you won't be fit for service anymore," he replied, his voice ominous.
<br><br>
Charmaine shuddered at the implication. She had no choice but to comply, for fear of losing the only stability she had known in her life.
<br><br>
"Come with me to the kitchen, I'll make the announcement," he commanded, leading her to the door.
<br><br>
Lunch had just commenced when they entered. Everyone's gaze looked up to see the late arrivals, then down Charmaine's body, then froze at the patch of freshly revealed skin.
<br><br>
Gasps echoed through the kitchen as faces registered shock and curiosity.
<br><br>
"Charmaine will have her duties expanded," the butler announced. "She will now work in more areas of the household. In that respect, I have found it necessary to tell her to get rid of all that hair down below. If one of those hairs made it onto Sir Richard's plate..."
<br><br>
He stopped, unable to continue; everyone shuddered at the thought, and the implications of such a horrible thing ever happening.
<br><br>
"Marianne," he turned towards another maid, "take her to the master's wing after lunch and show her what to do."
<br><br>
The afternoon saw Charmaine mainly sweeping floors in large rooms, intimidating with their ancient furniture and with the numerous portraits of Sir Richard's ancestors hanging on the walls.
<br><br>
With just Marianne around, Charmaine was even able to forget for a while that she was still naked.
<br><br>
She was grateful for the distraction provided by the tasks they had to accomplish together. They cleaned a number of rooms, polished the floorboards until they gleamed, and scrubbed windowsills until their fingers ached.
<br><br>
Throughout the day, Marianne treated Charmaine kindly, giving her guidance on how to perform her new duties effectively and sharing some of the tricks she had learned over the years. Despite the grueling work, Charmaine found comfort in having someone to lean on, even if it was only temporary.
<br><br>
As evening approached, Charmaine began to grow weary. She was grateful when dinner time arrived. When she entered the kitchen though, everyone's stares at her crotch immediately reminded her of her newly enhanced nudity. Being a good looking girl, she had always attracted much male attention. What she was suffering now though was on an entirely different level.
<br><br>
She hurried to her place at the table and said not a word to anyone during dinner. Her mind was focused solely on getting through the meal without drawing any further unwanted attention to her state of undress. As the evening wore on, Charmaine found solace in the company of her fellow servants, who despite their initial shock, eventually grew accustomed to her nudity. Although the butler's room was far from the other servants' quarters, they knew it was essential to maintain a degree of decorum and discipline.
<br><br>
For the sake of appearances, they avoided discussing Charmaine's predicament openly, although whispers circulated throughout the house among the staff.
<br><br>
That evening, when lying in bed and replaying in her mind the events of the day, Charmaine kept coming back to the memory of James' fingers between her legs, and the intent stares of the household on that region of her skin when she entered the common room. An unfamiliar warm sensation made her put her hand there and explore the area, imagining that the fingers freely roaming the sensitive skin were not hers but belonged to James.
<br><br>
She felt a strange mix of shame and arousal, something that hadn't occurred to her before. With her mind still on James's touches, and her hand still firmly between her legs, she finally drifted off to sleep.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 6 [Serving in the Master's Wing - Still Naked (Wednesday)] ===</span></div><br><br>
Charmaine woke early the next morning, her heart pounding in her chest. She trembled when she walked naked out of her room, the feeling of cold air on her bare skin still unusual, enhancing her feeling of vulnerability.
<br><br>
She hurried down the dimly lit corridor, her steps echoing off the rough wooden floorboards. The faint sound of distant laughter from the grand ballroom below filtered upwards, reminding her of the decadent lifestyle that lay beyond the confines of her quarters. Of course, it was only the servants there today, no doubt cleaning the place, since the family was currently on a trip to London.
<br><br>
In the distance, she could hear the gentle murmur of voices from the servants' common room. With deliberate steps, Charmaine descended the final flight of stairs leading to the kitchen. Taking a mental grip on herself, she stepped into the bustling space filled with the warm scents of food and bodies. The cook and the kitchen boys already busied themselves around the table and the stove, sharing news and discussing their duties as they worked.
<br><br>
They stopped their work to gaze at Charmaine, her nudity a novelty which would never wear off, especially now that her pubic hair had been shaved off and even that final patch of modesty had been removed.
<br><br>
Determined not to let their judgments affect her, Charmaine approached the sink and began helping with the food. As she scrubbed potatoes, she caught sight of the clock hanging on the wall - barely seven in the morning.
<br><br>
Her previous days had been a nightmare and she could not think of a worse thing that could have happened to her.
<br><br>
On this third day of her naked servitude, Charmaine was happy to have some short respite.
<br><br>
After breakfast, Marianne took her to the master's wing of the manor, guiding her step-by-step through the myriad of tasks that fell upon the housemaids.
<br><br>
They first had to dust and polish the antique furniture. Charmaine's heart raced as she noticed that all the surfaces were highly reflective, making her nudity even more apparent.
<br><br>
As the sunlight streamed through the tall windows, creating dancing shadows across the room, Charmaine's task list continued to grow. Marianne patiently instructed her on how to properly prepare the chamber for the return of the family, making sure nothing was left out.
<br><br>
As Charmaine absorbed the instructions, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy toward Marianne. She appeared so confident and knowledgeable, having managed to survive here for so long without incident. It seemed like she had been granted a sense of security within these walls that Charmaine could only dream of attaining.
<br><br>
Their interaction continued throughout the day, both working diligently alongside each other, moving from room to room to ensure every corner was perfect.
<br><br>
After lunch in the common room, with everyone's silent attention on Charmaine as was now normal, they returned to their work.
<br><br>
Marianne continued to train her. Charmaine had begun to understand the rhythm of her new life, where every task had a specific order, and each room held its own unique history. She was learning to find solace in the routine, allowing her to focus on her work instead of the discomfort of her exposed body.
<br><br>
In one particular room, Marianne pointed out the most intricate piece of artwork; a portrait of Sir Richard. This painting depicted him in his prime, his eyes penetrating and intense, commanding respect and admiration.
<br><br>
"Sir Richard was quite a character," Marianne remarked, observing Charmaine's interest in the portrait. "His family has owned this estate for twelve generations."
<br><br>
Charmaine's cheeks flushed slightly, and she looked away from the painting, finding her voice. "I didn't realize... I mean, I've heard stories about him, but..." She trailed off, not wanting to pry.
<br><br>
"Oh yes, he was known for his adventures," Marianne replied, her tone laced with a hint of nostalgia.
<br><br>
"But enough about him. Let's move on to the next room."
<br><br>
The huge formal dining room was next. After they tidied it up, there was still some time until dinner. Marianne decided to teach Charmaine the proper manners of a maid serving lunch to aristocratic guests.
<br><br>
She demonstrated how to pour wine without spilling, how to serve the meal with grace, and how to address guests with respect. As Charmaine observed Marianne, she realized that despite being unaware of what her future holds, Marianne's confidence in her role as a servant stemmed from her experience. She wanted that same self-assurance.
<br><br>
As they moved onto setting the table for dinner, Charmaine was determined to prove herself. They spread a table cloth on the formal dinner table, and she practiced arranging silverware with precision, ensuring the cutlery matched the style of the occasion.
<br><br>
Marianne then sat at the head of the table and said,  "Alright, let us do a bit of practice of what you learned today. You're going to be serving dinner tonight. Take your place near the wall, next to the serving table."
<br><br>
"Clasp you hands behind your bag. Spread your legs a little. Yes, this is the pose you take while awaiting your next orders. Remember, your posture must remain straight and erect at all times. You need to show respect and professionalism."
<br><br>
Charmaine did as she was told, standing rigidly by the wall. Her heart raced as she awaited Marianne's approval.
<br><br>
"Good, you're getting the hang of it," Marianne praised. "Now, we'll practice serving a mock dinner."
<br><br>
"Simply imagine that I am Sir Richard at the head of the table, and our guests around the table are aristocrats waiting to be served," Marianne explained, her voice calm and reassuring.
<br><br>
Charmaine tried to imagine the room full of stately, well dressed men, all looking at her expectantly. She also remembered the view of herself in the mirror, and the spectacle she was presenting with her slightly open legs, the region between them cleanly shaved. She shuddered at the vision, turning crimson red all over from the sudden heat of embarrassment. Despite her nervousness, she performed her task with grace, bringing the imaginary Sir Richard his wine. Marianne responded with a nod, acknowledging her performance.
<br><br>
"Hors d'oeuvre next," she instructed. "Remember, when serving appetizers, always offer the delicacy to the right hand side of the guest. If it's a lady, ensure she takes the first piece before offering it to others."
<br><br>
Charmaine took a deep breath, attempting to recall these intricacies of service. She carried the small dishes around the table, pretending to present them to imaginary guests, feeling their imaginary gazes bore into her.
<br><br>
The entire scenario seemed absurd, but it helped her learn the etiquette necessary for such events. The more she practiced, the more her confidence grew.
<br><br>
With renewed determination, Charmaine followed Marianne's guidance, focusing on the finer points of her job. By the end of the final imaginary course, she felt a sense of accomplishment as she felt that she had learned much this day.
<br><br>
"That's excellent, Charmaine," Marianne said, surveying her from head to toe. "Let us return everything to its place and head downstairs for dinner."
<br><br>
All plates and cutlery were duly returned to their cupboards, and the tablecloth was carefully folded and stored away.
<br><br>
As they walked down the hallway, Marianne casually asked, "How are you finding it here?"
<br><br>
Charmaine hesitated for a moment, wondering whether she should share her true feelings. She settled on honesty, saying, "It's difficult, but I appreciate the lessons you've taught me. It helps me cope with the situation."
<br><br>
"We all have our challenges, dear. Don't fret, everything will be alright. Just remember, the key to handling any situation is maintaining composure and grace under pressure."
<br><br>
Charmaine was grateful for her kindness and understanding. "Thank you, Marianne. I hope things will get better."
<br><br>
As they reached the bottom of the staircase, they entered the grand entrance hall, with its magnificent chandelier casting flickering shadows across the marble floor. Charmaine tried to imagine it full of life and activity, with guests arriving and family members meeting them here. Then she caught a glimpse of her naked figure in a large mirror, and suddenly felt exposed once again. Her face turned scarlet, and she quickly looked away. It wasn't just the physical exposure that bothered her, but the constant reminder of her vulnerability in this opulent environment.
<br><br>
Marianne noticed Charmaine's unease and gently placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry, dear," she whispered softly. "You're doing splendidly. Remember, it's not the way you look that matters, but the way you carry yourself.
<br><br>
Always hold your head high and keep a composed expression," Marianne continued, offering words of wisdom. Charmaine appreciated the advice, knowing that maintaining poise would indeed make her feel more confident and secure. In the back of her mind though, a small voice wondered whether Marianne would have been able to keep her own advice had the situation been reversed.During dinner, Charmaine found herself glancing at the other servants, trying to gauge their attitude to her. However, their expressions remained unchanged, neither cold nor warm. Was she truly becoming a part of this world? Was it possible that what was happening to her was normal in this world?
<br><br>
She thought back to Marianne's words - "It's not the way you look that matters, but the way you carry yourself." Maybe she was beginning to understand that she had to embrace her situation rather than resist it. Although, what exactly would that entail?
<br><br>
After dinner, she again refused the mocking invitations to stay back and participate in some entertainment. Back in her room, she was happy to go into her bed and cover herself, the bed sheet and blanket a reminder of the now almost forgotten feeling of clothes against her skin.
<br><br>
She was not as exhausted as the day before and couldn't sleep for a long time, her thoughts swirling through her head like a whirlwind. Marianne's words kept resonating in her mind, the phrase "carry yourself" taking on new meanings every time she remembered them.
<br><br>
On the verge of getting asleep, she saw herself as a proud member of society, moving around with confidence in the dignified circles of the middle class. She imagined herself walking into a fashionable shop and walking around inspecting the merchandise, until she saw her nude body reflected in a mirror. With that picture in front of her eyes, she fell asleep.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 7 [Nude Entertainment for the Butler's Guests (Thursday)] ===</span></div><br><br>
Charmaine woke up early the next morning, feeling somewhat relaxed after the relatively easy day she had experienced with Marianne. As she was reflecting on it though, she was startled to realize that she had considered a full day of nude servitude relaxing. Had she really become so accustomed to her new life? It seemed unthinkable.
<br><br>
Following breakfast, Charmaine sought out Marianne to discuss their plans to day. It was futile though, as they were interrupted by the butler, who strolled into the kitchen with purpose.
<br><br>
"Marianne has given a good report of your performance yesterday, Charmaine," he announced. "You are ready for the next step in your training, of which I will personally take care."
<br><br>
He paused, observing Charmaine's reaction. "You will continue learning good table serving manners."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, realizing that her new responsibilities were about to expand. "What exactly does that involve?" she asked, hoping to understand better.
<br><br>
"You will learn soon enough. Today, you can work in the kitchen and assist the cook with the preparation of some food I have already instructed her about. And," he added looking at her meaningfully, "make sure you have your own dinner before the regular time. I will need you after that, so make sure you report to my room at a quarter to seven, sharp. You know what happens when you are late for duty," Mr. Paine said sternly, making sure his warning resonated. He knew she understood the consequences of disobeying him.
<br><br>
Charmaine's face paled, her heart racing. She was determined not to disappoint him.
<br><br>
The day passed in a haze of chopping vegetables, seasoning meat, simmering sauces, and endless speculation of what the butler had in mind for her. The kitchen staff watched her intently, their faces betraying no hint of friendliness or animosity. They seemed to accept her presence without question or comment.
<br><br>
By the time dinner approached, Charmaine was exhausted. She had prepared several courses, including dessert, under the watchful eye of the cook.
<br><br>
Taking a deep breath, she made her way to the butler's room. She stopped in front of a mirror in a corridor along her way, her reflection making her shiver. She couldn't help but notice how her full nudity accentuated her curves. This made her feel self-conscious, but she reminded herself of Marianne's earlier words – to carry herself with grace and composure. Steeling herself, she proceeded towards the butler's room.
<br><br>
Arriving promptly at 6:45 PM, Charmaine knocked lightly on the door, anxious yet resolved.
<br><br>
Opening the door, the butler peered at her. His eyes raked over her bare form appreciatively. "You may enter," he said coolly, allowing her inside.
<br><br>
Stepping into the well lit room, Charmaine closed the door behind her, feeling a mixture of fear and excitement coursing through her veins.
<br><br>
She stood tall, her arms at her sides, head held high, determined to showcase the grace and composure Marianne had advised her to possess.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine motioned for her to come closer.
<br><br>
Her thoughts raced as she wondered what task he had planned for her tonight.
<br><br>
Seeing her uncertainty, Mr. Paine decided to break the silence. "You've done well thus far, Charmaine," he began, his tone both praising and condescending. "Your performance in the dining room yesterday has been commendable."
<br><br>
Charmaine couldn't hide her relief. "Thank you, sir," she replied, her voice wavering slightly.
<br><br>
"We can now build on that..."
<br><br>
"I understand that you did mock practice at an empty table. I have gone to the trouble of arranging a better practice for you today. You should be grateful for the opportunity."
<br><br>
Mr. Paine paused, letting his words sink in. Charmaine swallowed hard, her eyes wide with apprehension. "This evening, we shall put your skills to the test."
<br><br>
With a slight smirk, he led her further into the room. His gaze swept over her naked body, a mix of admiration and lust evident in his eyes.
<br><br>
Charmaine felt uneasy under his scrutiny but tried to maintain her composure.
<br><br>
"I have arranged a special dinner for some special guests," he continued, his voice dripping with subtle malice. "And, you will be attending them."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank. She could only nod silently, a mixture of dread and trepidation coursing through her.
<br><br>
Her heart pounded in her chest, and her palms grew clammy. The butler must have noticed her distress because he offered a thin smile, enjoying her discomfort. "Remember what we discussed earlier," he taunted. "Carry yourself with pride and grace. And do the household proud."
<br><br>
Charmaine took a deep breath, steeling herself against the mounting panic. Despite her terror, she knew that she had no choice but to comply. She must face this challenge bravely and remain composed, despite the overwhelming anxiety flooding her system.
<br><br>
With an effort to maintain her resolve, Charmaine nodded again, her lips quivering. Mr. Paine's grin widened, as if pleased with her submission. He clapped his hands together once, signaling the end of their discussion. Avoiding any lingering glances at Charmaine, he turned to a nearby cabinet and opened one of its drawers. "Here, arrange the table as you were taught to," Mr. Paine commanded, pointing to the table.
<br><br>
Gulping down her nervousness, Charmaine tried to block from her mind the grossly indecent scene she had endured on that table. The memory of her lying on that table, her hips high in the air, her legs wide open, and James' ministrations to the area between them under the watchful gaze of the butler, caused a shiver to run down her spine. It was something she never wanted to experience again, or even think about.
<br><br>
Carefully, she set about arranging the table, ensuring everything was neatly placed, all the while pondering on the question of who those guests might be.
<br><br>
The butler had mentioned "special guests" casually, deliberately providing no more information - no doubt wanting her to suffer in anticipation. It wasn't the first time Mr. Paine had intentionally inflicted such mental torture upon her. It seemed that he had made it his goal in life to submit her to a heavy amount of humiliation and subjugation, designed to strip away her sense of self and her dignity.
<br><br>
As Charmaine worked diligently, her mind flitted between thoughts of the unknown guests and the unavoidable attention she would attract when serving them. She feared what the reaction of these visitors would be upon seeing her bare form. She did not have to wait long before she found out...
<br><br>
A quiet knock on the door announced their arrival. The footman James appeared at the doorway, casting a lecherous gaze upon Charmaine. His shining eyes conveyed the message that he was looking forward to the evening's entertainment. Charmaine swallowed, her cheeks reddening with embarrassment.
<br><br>
James held the door open, in the manner of a butler announcing important visitors, and intoned:
<br><br>
"Sir Thomas, and Sir William!"
<br><br>
Two men entered the room, their expressions ranging from amusement to bemusement. Charmaine couldn't miss the calculating glint in their eyes, and her heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
"Of course," James continued in a normal tone, "they are not real lords."
<br><br>
"Mr. Paine has told us that he wants to arrange a little charade this evening, a bit of a play. We will pretend to be gentlemen visitors to the house, and you will practice your serving skills with us. For the duration of the evening, you shall address Mr. Pain as Sir George, and myself as Sir James. And keep in mind, we are very, very important persons and we expect only the best of service."
<br><br>
Sir Thomas snickered, "It's always a delight to see a pretty girl like her learn her lessons well, eh, Sir James?"
<br><br>
Charmaine blushed, her ears burning crimson. She lowered her eyes, trying to hide her growing discomfort beneath the table.
<br><br>
Sir William chimed in, his voice filled with an air of superiority. "Indeed, Sir Thomas. This should prove most educational, don't you agree, Sir George?"
<br><br>
"Yes, indeed," Mr. Paine agreed, savoring the role he had assigned himself.
<br><br>
He then turned to Charmaine: "For a bit of additional context, these are two of my best friends. We have all served in Sir Richard's regiment - James too, indeed, and have been through much together. Do not disgrace me in front of them."
<br><br>
"But Sir, I am completely naked in front of these strangers," Charmaine pleaded in a low voice, her eyes brimming with fear.
<br><br>
The butler grinned, "Oh, but sweetheart, they won't care about that. In fact, they might find it quite amusing."
<br><br>
"There is nothing to worry about," Mr. Paine added. "They have all been sworn to secrecy. Nothing that happens here tonight will be told. Ever."
<br><br>
Charmaine's knees trembled, and she could hardly stand. Fear gripped her heart as she realized there was nothing she could do to prevent what was about to happen.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas and Sir William settled themselves comfortably on the sofa. Their smirks betrayed their intentions.
<br><br>
These "lords" were clearly up to no good. Charmaine tried to suppress the rising dread in her stomach, her body quivering with apprehension. There was no turning back; she had to carry on with the charade and hope that somehow, she would manage to navigate through this nightmare and survive the evening.
<br><br>
"When important people visit," started his instructions Mr. Paine, "the house staff must greet them formally. So, whenever either of them enters the room, you should bow deeply, saying 'Good evening, Sir.'"
<br><br>
Charmaine practiced the gesture a few times, imitating the bowing and speech pattern he demonstrated. She hesitated before trying to say "Good evening, Sir," her throat constricted by the reality of the situation. Charmaine's eyes watered slightly, but she managed the greeting without wavering.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas grinned appreciatively, "Ah, such a polite young woman. Don't forget, she needs to remember her place, Sir George."
<br><br>
Sir William laughed, "Quite right, Sir Thomas. Let's make sure she learns the finer points of her duties."
<br><br>
Mr. Paine gave her a pat on the bottom, a sickening smile playing on his lips. "Now, go prepare drinks for our distinguished guests, Charmaine."
<br><br>
"Yes, Mr. Paine," she said. She was surprised by a loud, stinging smack on her bare bottom, and cried out involuntarily.
<br><br>
"What did we just tell you?," the butler asked. "This evening, I am sir George to you. Forgetting a guest's name, and - even worse - getting it wrong, is inexcusable."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed, mortified. "I apologize, Sir George," she whispered, her cheeks burning with shame.
<br><br>
"An apology is not enough, methinks," interjected Sir Thomas. "We are here to further her education, and I suppose a quick and sharp lesson is in order."
<br><br>
"Very true," agreed the butler. "Come here, Charmaine."
<br><br>
The sinister gleam in Mr. Paine's eyes was chilling. He motioned for her to come closer. She obeyed, her heart pounding, feeling a cold sweat on her forehead. "Do you know why we are doing this?" he whispered, his breath tickling her ear.
<br><br>
"Yes, Sir George," she responded nervously, unable to look him in the eye. "It is all for my own good."
<br><br>
"To etch this into your memory, I will apply another spanking. You are lucky that I am in a good mood tonight, so it will not be the strap," he explained while leading her to an armchair in a corner. He had her lean over one of the arm rests and grab the other, her bare bottom prominently exposed, her breasts hanging freely above the chair's cushion..
<br><br>
"How many smacks, do you think?," he addressed his comrades across the room.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas and Sir William exchanged knowing glances, their anticipation building. "As a first offense, twelve should suffice," one of them hazarded after a brief pause.
<br><br>
"Alright then, let's proceed," Mr. Paine announced solemnly. With measured force, he struck Charmaine's behind a dozen times, causing her to yelp in pain. Each impact sent searing waves through her entire body, leaving her limbs trembling and her breath ragged. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mixing with her sweat. He measured the timing between the smacks, making sure she fully felt the consequence of each blow before inflicting the next.
<br><br>
Her cries pierced the silence of the room, causing the guests to share a wicked smile. When he finally stopped, Charmaine's body was wracked with sobs, and her face was streaked with tears. "That should teach you a valuable lesson," Mr. Paine stated with a satisfied grin.
<br><br>
He returned to the table, leaving Charmaine there. She was afraid to move, having been given no instructions to do so.
<br><br>
"Let's have a smoke before we proceed with the rest of the evening," the butler said, offering cigars to his visitors. They all lit their cigars and drifted into the corner where Charmaine still stood, gripping the chair's arm rest, her bottom high in the air.
<br><br>
"A prime piece of ... staff you have here, I dare say," observed Sir Thomas, his eyes taking a slow stroll down her pale skin and stopping at the angry red of her bare bottom. "No wonder you take such pride in her."
<br><br>
"She does possess a certain allure, doesn't she?" remarked Sir William, studying her features from the side, gazing at the allure of her freely hanging breasts.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart pounded wildly as she listened to their comments, her cheeks reddening further. She wanted to scream, to escape from the torment she was experiencing, but knew it would do her no good. Her helplessness only fueled their amusement.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas and Sir William took turns inspecting every inch of her body, scrutinizing her with perverse interest. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense, Charmaine's vulnerability palpable to everyone present. As the clock ticked away, the trio shared knowing glances, their plans unfolding before her terrified eyes.
<br><br>
Finally, Sir Thomas spoke, his voice dripping with malice.
<br><br>
"Shall we have some fun with this lovely little servant?"
<br><br>
Sir William nodded enthusiastically, his eyes gleaming with sinister intent. "Absolutely! What say we give her a proper initiation?"
<br><br>
Mr. Paine smiled, enjoying the cruel game they were setting up. "Why not? After all, she is here to learn and serve, isn't she?"
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank. Despite her terror, she knew better than to protest or resist. It would only invite more punishment. Charmaine felt trapped, surrounded by predators eager to devour her innocence. With a heavy heart, she surrendered to her fate, hoping against hope that she would somehow survive this horrible night.
<br><br>
"So, let's begin our game," proposed Sir Thomas with a devious grin. "I suggest we have her perform tasks and reward her if she performs well, while giving her a spanking if she fails."
<br><br>
"A splendid idea, my dear fellow," replied Sir William, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. "Let's begin with something simple – she can bring us our refreshments."
<br><br>
Sir Thomas nodded approvingly. "Excellent. We shall test her dedication to her betters."
<br><br>
Charmaine listened to the two men with growing dread, her heart racing as they discussed her fate.
<br><br>
She stood frozen, listening intently to their twisted banter, her heart pounding madly in her chest. The sound of the clock echoed ominously around the room, ticking away the seconds like an approaching death sentence.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas took a puff from his cigar, a cruel grin spreading across his face. "If she fails, we spank her. If she succeeds, we reward her."
<br><br>
Sir William agreed enthusiastically, taking another drag from his cigar.
<br><br>
"Indeed, it'll be quite entertaining to see how she fares. And what did you have in mind in terms of a reward?", Sir Thomas asked, his eyes fixed on Charmaine.
<br><br>
"How about a kiss on the neck?" suggested Sir William, his voice filled with wicked intent. "She could serve us the wine, and when she returns with the glasses, we give her the reward."
<br><br>
Sir Thomas nodded in agreement. "A most fitting prize for someone willing to please her betters. And with the next tasks, she may get a kiss to some other part of her so deliciously naked body..."
<br><br>
Charmaine felt her heart race, fear gripping her insides. She couldn't help but feel violated by these lecherous ideas.
<br><br>
Their lascivious gaze made her skin crawl, her heartbeat racing as she listened to their deviant suggestions. The prospect of performing these tasks left her nauseous, but she understood the consequences of disobeying them. With shaking hands, she got up from the armchair and retrieved the glasses, her face burning with humiliation.
<br><br>
As she served everyone their wine, the four men watched her closely, their eyes boring into her body. "Now, it's time for your reward," said Sir Thomas, his voice laced with malevolence.
<br><br>
He gestured for Charmaine to approach him. With trembling hands, she did, her eyes downcast, unable to meet his eyes.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas took her chin gently in his hand, lifting her face towards him. His touch sent shivers down her spine, and her heart raced wildly. Slowly, he brushed his thumb across her cheekbone, then moved his fingers to her neck.
<br><br>
Feeling a mixture of trepidation and revulsion, Charmaine held her breath as Sir Thomas drew nearer. She could feel the warmth of his breath on her neck, and a shiver ran down her spine.
<br><br>
"Close your eyes," he commanded softly, his voice sending shivers down her spine. Terrified, yet unable to defy him, she closed her eyes, awaiting her fate. Slowly, she felt his cool fingers graze her neck, a gentle touch that sent a chill down her spine. As he neared the spot where he would plant his kiss, Charmaine's heart raced faster. Her eyes darted frantically, seeking any means of escape. But there was none.
<br><br>
Sir Thomas lowered his lips to her neck, but just as he was about to make contact, Charmaine threw herself backward, narrowly escaping his grasp. Stumbling backwards, she crashed into the nearby table, sending several items tumbling to the floor.
<br><br>
All eyes turned to her in shock. James, the footman, watched her retreat intently.
<br><br>
In the midst of chaos, Charmaine clutched her chest, her heart hammering in her ears.
<br><br>
The men in the room exchanged surprised looks, clearly taken aback by her unexpected move. "Well, well," muttered Sir Thomas, "it seems our young maid has spirit."
<br><br>
Sir William gave a laugh, unimpressed by her boldness. "Nevertheless, the rules remain. She must complete the task as instructed and receive her reward. Otherwise, she must receive another spanking."
<br><br>
James cleared his throat. "May I suggest we dispense with the rewards, gentlemen? After all, no member of the staff gets a reward for just doing what is expected of them anyway," James continued, looking intently at the butler. Mr. Paine hesitantly confirmed with a nod.
<br><br>
Charmaine could not believe her ears. This interjection was apparently intended to save her from the amorous intentions of the two strangers.
<br><br>
However, she felt a mix of gratitude and confusion towards James' unexpected defense. She couldn't help but notice the gleam in his eye, which nevertheless seemed to imply some sort of satisfaction at her plight. Was he looking out for her or simply saving her for himself? She couldn't tell, but it made her uneasy nonetheless.
<br><br>
With a heavy heart, Charmaine prepared to fulfill her further duties for the evening. She hoped that this would end soon; the longer she stayed, the more danger she faced. Her hands shook slightly as she poured more drinks, trying to ignore the smirks of the three men watching her. James stood in the corner, observing her with an unreadable expression.
<br><br>
"Time for dinner," the butler announced. "Show us what you learned yesterday, Charmaine."
<br><br>
The naked maid started setting up the dinner table with the formal arrangement she had been taught the day before.
<br><br>
Her movements were cautious, attempting to maintain a modicum of dignity amidst the leering gazes of the assembled company. She was aware that whatever was going on tonight was wrong, but she had little choice in the matter.
<br><br>
Her blonde hair swung over her shoulder as she reached out for the fine china, its golden glimmer catching the light from the chandelier above.
<br><br>
She carefully placed the dinner plates and the silverware, feeling her heart pound in her chest. She finished arranging the place settings and stepped back, her heart still racing. The food was on a large tray waiting on a trolley near the door. She lifted its lid, exposing the still warm meal beneath, allowing the rich scents to fill the air.
<br><br>
James observed her movements carefully, his gaze lingering on her every action. His eyes darkened as they traced her curves, hinting at his own desires. Charmaine felt terribly exposed under his watchful gaze, her skin crawling with nervous energy.
<br><br>
She tried to avoid meeting his eyes, focusing instead on the task at hand. She commenced serving each of the men seated at the table, one by one, delivering the food with a shaky hand.
<br><br>
She received six loud spanks on her bare behind, draped across Sir William's knees, for arranging his forks in the wrong order.
<br><br>
"You will learn, girl!" said Sir William with an evil grin. "Remember, discipline is essential for service."
<br><br>
Her cheeks burned as the guests laughed at her predicament. Despite the humiliation, she remained silent, too frightened to show any signs of resistance, especially after the earlier scene from which she was only saved by James' quick intervention.
<br><br>
The atmosphere became increasingly relaxed as the men dove into their meals and discussed their common past exploits, leaving Charmaine to serve them diligently and quietly.
<br><br>
After dessert, they all got up, leaving her to clear the table - a slow job which they observed with interest from their positions in the corner of the room.
<br><br>
"What do you say to a spot of cards," proposed Sir William, a predatory gleam in his eye. "Something to pass the time while our pretty young naked maid here perhaps entertains us otherwise."
<br><br>
 With her task of clearing the table completed, Charmaine now found herself standing alone, feeling even more vulnerable. She had not forgotten to take the pose Marianne had shown her, next to the wall, hands clasped behind her, legs slightly open.
<br><br>
The butler produced a deck of cards and began dealing a game of poker. "And what will be the stakes?," asked Sir William, his eyes fixated on Charmaine. "It would be a shame to play for money, having something much better at hand."
<br><br>
She knew she could not refuse their demands. The men's eyes bore into her, as if they could read her thoughts.
<br><br>
"Now that you mention a hand, ha-ha", said Mr. Paine, chuckling at his own sense of humor, "May I suggest that the winner of each round give Charmaine three spanks by hand? I have a feeling she did not get enough such encouragement today."
<br><br>
The game seemed to last forever. After each round, Charmaine found herself draped across the knees of the winner, receiving three loud smacks each time. She then had to endure the next game still in that position, her bare red bottom up in the air for everyone to see. Her heart raced, her face flushed, and tears threatened to spill over.
<br><br>
As if this was not lewd enough, they found a further refinement to her humiliation. To her horror it was James who was the first to spread her legs wide, putting on full display not only her bottom but also the most private parts of her body. Each man took turns in this ritual, relishing the opportunity to inspect her most personal areas with their eyes. They seemed to savor the moment like predators enjoying their feast.
<br><br>
Charmaine was beyond embarrassment and shame, her tears mixing with the sweat forming on her brow. Her face was as scarlet as her backside, yet she dared not move nor utter a sound.
<br><br>
She had almost passed out when they at long last decided to call it a night. The butler ordered her to take the tray and the remnants of dinner to the kitchen, and to return to his room.
<br><br>
Back there, she had to take a last lesson in etiquette for the day.
<br><br>
She walked in front of the guests, the men admiring her backside, leading them to the entry hall of the manor. There, she helped them put on their coats and hats, thanking them profusely for their esteemed visit.
<br><br>
Even there, Mr. Paine managed to find another little humiliation for her. He noticed some dirt on the visitors' shoes, and sent Charmaine for a shoe brush and some wax. She knelt in front of them and polished their shoes while they looked appreciatively at her efforts.
<br><br>
"Thank you for a most entertaining evening," the mock "Sir" Thomas said looking at the butler. "And I trust we shall have many more of the kind."
<br><br>
The other "gentleman" nodded in agreement, eager to take part again in this perverse sport. Charmaine's eyes welled up as she led them to the front door. The cold night air hit her, contrasting sharply with the heat she had experienced indoors. She wished she could disappear into the darkness, away from these tormentors.
<br><br>
She bid them goodnight, curtsying deeply, her eyes cast downward, and was grateful when she could finally close the door after them.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine and James were still there, of course. While they were walking back through the house, she heard the butler telling James: "Well, I hope Sir Richard will not put an end to our educational project when he comes back on Monday."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank, hearing that the torture might continue. In her mind, she prayed for divine intervention to save her from this horrible ordeal. A week of it was already terrible beyond description, how was it possible for it to be prolonged?
<br><br>
Upon reaching the butler's room, Mr. Paine finally told Charmaine to go back to her room, while he motioned James to follow him in, no doubt to discuss their further strategy.
<br><br>
Charmaine slowly ascended the stairs back to her small room, tears welling up in her eyes. How could this possibly go on?
<br><br>
Lucky for her, she was so tired that she fell asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 8 [The Stables (Friday)] ===</span></div><br><br>
The next morning, Charmaine found the kitchen staff somehow subdued. Only half in jest, the cook, Mrs. Atkinson, threatened Stanley the kitchen boy with the cleaver when he approached the naked Charmaine with mischief in his eyes.
<br><br>
Word had somehow gone out of her rough treatment the night before, and James had been delegated to talk to the butler, Mr. Paine, and express the feeling of all staff that this was a bit too much. The constant nudity enforced upon Charmaine was one thing, but wanton spankings - at the hands of outsiders too - was stepping over an invisible boundary they felt should be preserved.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine had grudgingly acknowledged their concerns, James quietly informed Charmaine. She was still not sure of his role in all of this though - James had taken active participation in the night's events himself, after all. On the other hand, no one but him could have instigated this intervention.
<br><br>
At breakfast, many of the staff avoided looking in the direction of Charmaine, which was a novelty. Everyone noiselessly shuffled out after the meal, leaving Charmaine alone with the cook.
<br><br>
Mrs. Atkinson left her alone, and even wordlessly brought her a cup of tea when she noticed Charmaine staring blankly at a wall and not moving for a while.
<br><br>
Presently, Charmaine got up and started going about her chores, without waiting for instructions by Mrs. Atkinson. When lunchtime came, they were smoothly working together as a tiny two-person team of professionals - one of them in the stately uniform of the main cook of an English lord's manor, the other one stark naked and shaved between her legs.
<br><br>
It was a surreal experience for both of them, to say the least.
<br><br>
Lunch was also somewhat quieter than normal, but not as dreary as breakfast. The male members of the staff started casting long gazes towards Charmaine's large breasts, and followed her movements around the table with rapt interest.
<br><br>
After lunch, Charmaine found herself with no assigned task; she had walked into the court yard and Mrs. Atkinson had given her a wave with the hand as if she did not expect her to come back into the kitchen.
<br><br>
Not entirely sure where she could go, Charmaine set off to explore, until she soon found herself near the stables. With unease, she saw James sitting on a bench in front, repairing an old saddle. Upon seeing her, he quickly stood up and greeted her with a nod, unsure what he could say to her after the experience of the previous night.
<br><br>
Her heart pounded, she wasn't expecting to meet him again so soon, and definitely not here. But he looked different now, serious, like he might actually offer help rather than cause trouble. It was then that Charmaine realized she had no idea what they do in the stables.
<br><br>
"Um, what exactly is it that you are doing here," she said, feeling foolish. "In the stables, I mean..."
<br><br>
"I like to help out the stable hands in my spare time, to manage the horses and see to their care," James explained, his voice sounding slightly embarrassed. "That includes feeding them, cleaning their stalls, and sometimes riding them for exercise. I was in the cavalry before..."
<br><br>
"Occasionally, I also repair some of the equipment," he added, pointing to the saddle.
<br><br>
James took notice of her awkwardness and tried to ease her discomfort. "Come, I can show you around," he gently invited, trying to break the tension. Though nervous about her reaction, he guided her into the stable. He pointed out the various horses, explaining their names, temperaments, and roles within the household. "This is Breeze, she's a thoroughbred mare used mainly for riding. And this is Titan, a strong workhorse who helps with heavy lifting and transportation."
<br><br>
As Charmaine followed James, her eyes roamed over the magnificent animals, taking in their muscular strength and glossy coats.
<br><br>
It struck her how little she knew about these creatures, despite being surrounded by them daily.
<br><br>
The atmosphere inside the stable felt warmer and more inviting compared to the rest of the house. There was a certain camaraderie among the workers, and Charmaine felt strangely drawn to it.
<br><br>
"You know, you really don't belong here," James finally uttered, unable to resist teasing her. "You should be in the kitchens helping Mrs. Atkinson, instead of running around the stables bare naked," James continued, his tone lighthearted yet concerned. He couldn't help but feel responsible for her situation, having seen her struggle under the butler's control, even though on another level he greatly enjoyed the opportunity to be able to ogle her nude forms to his heart's desire.
<br><br>
Charmaine blushed. "I didn't ask to be treated this way!" she managed to say.
<br><br>
"True," admitted James. "Now that you are here anyway, do you want to try and help out too?" he suggested.
<br><br>
Charmaine considered his proposal for a moment. She hesitated, unsure if she would be capable of handling such tasks. Finally, she decided that embracing this unexpected opportunity might provide her a chance to do something different she might enjoy. "Alright," she agreed tentatively.
<br><br>
James smiled in approval, pleased that he had showed initiative. "Then let's start with learning how to clean a horse's stall.
<br><br>
First, we need to get the necessary supplies – brushes, shovels, buckets, and hay." He pointed to a nearby enclosure.
<br><br>
"This is the cleaning area, where the stable hands store equipment and keep the supplies we'll need." Charmaine watched as James began to gather the tools needed for cleaning the stall. Intrigued, she joined him, keen to learn this new skill.
<br><br>
Together, they collected brushes of varying sizes, a shovel, a wheelbarrow, and armfuls of fresh hay. As they worked, Charmaine observed the horses, becoming more familiar with their individual quirks and personalities.
<br><br>
She appreciated the attention and care the stable workers provided for these magnificent creatures. Despite her initial apprehensions, she gradually began to find solace in this new environment.
<br><br>
Under James' guidance, Charmaine learned how to properly groom the horses and maintain their stalls. She discovered a surprising passion for this unfamiliar world, finding comfort in the simplicity and predictability of the routine
<br><br>
Predictably, the stable hands soon learned of her presence inside the stables, and found reasons to make themselves busy there too.
<br><br>
While Charmaine was initially wary of their intense attention, James reassured her that they just wanted to ensure she learned everything she needed to know. "They think you're a challenge and will become better at the job than they are," he joked with a grin. "But they like you, and you should not be afraid of them."
<br><br>
Chatting casually with James, Charmaine practically forgot that she was naked. It was easier to focus on the horses, rather than all the men around her.
<br><br>
As the day wore on, Charmaine grew increasingly comfortable in her new surroundings. She swiftly became adept at caring for the horses, thanks to James' patient instruction. The stable hands treated her with respect, and she wondered why they didn't treat her similarly in the main house.
<br><br>
Before it got dark, James felt emboldened enough to jokingly propose a re-enactment of the story of Lady Godiva. He expected Charmaine to say no and had resolved to not press the matter, still feeling his guilt in front of her for the night before.
<br><br>
However, she surprised him and the men who had gathered around by timidly smiling and asking, "And how do we go about that?"
<br><br>
A collective cheer went up from the group of stable hands, and Charmaine felt herself blushing with a mix of excitement and fear.
<br><br>
James couldn't help but feel pride in her boldness, knowing that he played a part in helping her develop this confidence.
<br><br>
Without giving her time to reconsider, James motioned everyone to clear some space, as he went to fetch one of the calmer horses.
<br><br>
Charmaine knew the legend of Lady Godiva well - a brave lady who rode a horse naked through her husband's town in order to convince him to lower the town's taxes. She also knew this would expose her to the gazes of these men in new ways they had not seen her before.
<br><br>
Yet, the warm feeling she had developed for them earlier, combined with her newfound love for horses, pushed her to accept the game. The thrill of showing them a side of herself she hadn't shown before even excited her.
<br><br>
Her breath caught in her throat as James returned leading the gentle mare, his gaze meeting hers with a mixture of admiration and curiosity.
<br><br>
James carefully helped onto the horse, which involved hoisting her up by the waist, then guiding her right leg up over the horse's back. For a long moment, she stood there halfway up, her right leg already high above, her left leg still hanging down. James was right behind her, holding her right thigh up, his left arm curled around her left leg, his face inches from her now gaping slit. Mesmerized by the view, he froze, forgetting what he had set out to do, until Charmaine realized what was happening and pulled herself up with her hands.
<br><br>
He had already seen her like this before, of course. But then, there wasn't a crowd around them, most of them with mouths hanging open.
<br><br>
Charmaine, whose face suddenly flushed red with the realization, sat upright on the horse, feeling completely exposed at this great height.
<br><br>
"We have to ride her through the town!" exclaimed one of the stable hands, grabbing the reins to guide Lady Godiva onward.
<br><br>
Charmaine tightened her grip on the saddle, feeling her heart racing with adrenaline. Her legs clamped firmly around the horse's body, instinctively pressing against it to stay on.
<br><br>
They moved slowly towards the gate of the stable, and out into the wide yard. Hearing the commotion, other house servants soon joined the stable hands and formed lines around an imaginary street, cheering the procession of Lady Godiva. They had quite forgotten the part of the legend according to which the townfolk did not look at her, with only Peeping Tom breaking the vow - for which he later suffered greatly.
<br><br>
The men surrounding Charmaine, however, seemed to have no intention of turning away their gazes. She could see the appreciation in their eyes, hear their whispers as they commented on her appearance. This was an invasion of privacy, but oddly enough, Charmaine was neither shocked nor frightened by the experience.
<br><br>
The wind rustled gently through her hair, and she felt its cool touch on her bare skin. The sunlight danced upon her, creating shadows where none were before.
<br><br>
Her pale skin glistened, her blonde hair billowed behind her, adding to the spectacle. The men watching felt their hearts race and chests tighten with desire. Even though all had previously seen her unclothed, they marveled at the sight once again.
<br><br>
The air filled with a strange electricity; some women's faces held a mix of jealousy and envy. Others couldn't help but laugh, enjoying the moment of beauty.
<br><br>
Charmaine, sitting tall on the horse, couldn't help but feel exhilarated despite her embarrassment. The sensation of freedom, the feeling of being looked at by so many people, caused her heart to beat faster.
<br><br>
"Bravo, my lady!" cheered the stable hands, encouraging her to continue on.
<br><br>
James, walking next to the horse all this time, supported her with a hand fixed on her leg.
<br><br>
They finished three circuits around the yard before Charmaine indicated that she would like to get off.
<br><br>
The crowd dispersed when they slowly returned to the stable. James had quietly but with authority taken the reins from the man who had had the honor before, and with a few pointed glances had made it clear to the stable hands that he he wished them to go elsewhere and leave him alone with Charmaine.
<br><br>
Still in the saddle, she looked down on him with a mixture of relief and confusion, her heart beating rapidly as she tried to process what had just happened. She felt a strange combination of arousal and nervousness, a kind of exhilaration and trepidation mixed together.
<br><br>
James, seeing her discomfort, offered her a small smile, hoping to reassure her. "Let me help you down," he said softly, his voice betraying a gentleness she hadn't noticed before.
<br><br>
He reached up, curling his left arm around her thigh. She knew that the process of getting down would be the reverse of climbing up, and what that entailed - it would be just as intimate and awkward as getting up had been.
<br><br>
She leaned forward, then brought her right leg up above the horse's back. James reached up to hold her thigh and guide it down. This time it was Charmaine who froze in this position, acutely feeling his face inches from her most intimate parts, feeling his hot breath on her wet slit.
<br><br>
She stood there like this for what felt like an eternity before she finally continued the motion. James positioned himself behind her, his strong arms wrapping around her midsection. With careful precision, he guided her on, ensuring she wouldn't fall as he eased her down onto the hard ground below.
<br><br>
Their bodies pressed close together, the heat radiating from James' chest warming her from the outside. Yet, she couldn't help but feel exposed, vulnerable.
<br><br>
Taking a deep breath, Charmaine allowed herself to appreciate the closeness of the moment. Though her mind raced with thoughts of the experience, her body felt strangely calm, accepting the contact.
<br><br>
They stood like that for a long time, her back pressed against him. She slowly turned to face him then; his hands unthinkingly dropped down, cupping her strong buttocks.
<br><br>
Charmaine couldn't suppress a slight gasp. She was startled not only by the action itself but also by the intensity of his grip. His expression showed a mix of surprise and understanding, as if he had somehow known this would happen. There was something powerful in the way he held her, protective yet possessive, dominating yet tender. His eyes burned with a fierce hunger that left Charmaine breathless.
<br><br>
The moment seemed to stretch endlessly, drawing them closer in an almost magnetic force.
<br><br>
Time seemed to stand still as they faced each other, their eyes locked.
<br><br>
Abruptly, she turned and broke the grip of his unresistant hands. Without a word, Charmaine ran across the yard and back into the familiar world of the kitchen.
<br><br>
In her bed this night, her hands wandered down her body, tracing her curves, remembering the feel of James' touch.
<br><br>
She couldn't decide whether to hate him for it or thank him. It felt as if someone had thrown a torch inside her, lighting up a fire she had never felt before. One thing was certain, though - her life would never be the same again.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 9 [The Visit (Saturday)] ===</span></div><br><br>
As Charmaine entered the kitchen, she couldn't help but notice the warmth emanating from the large stove. Her constant state of nudity was something she could not get herself accustomed to, although she made an effort to appear unaffected. Steeling herself, she approached the cook, hoping that Mrs. Atkinson would not be too harsh on her today.
<br><br>
Preparing the food, and then serving it to the other household members in the nude still felt grossly indecent, but Charmaine had learned to block out most of her embarrassment while focusing on her tasks. The servants pretended that nothing was amiss, even as they greatly enjoyed her predicament.
<br><br>
"In which rooms shall we put Mr. Eden and his house guest, I wonder," said a chambermaid, jolting Charmaine out of her reverie. She realized she had been sitting there, staring blankly into space, for a few moments. Blushing, she hastily returned to her breakfast.
<br><br>
A wave of unease washed over Charmaine. Mr. Eden, whoever he was, and his friend would surely contrive to expose her further. So far, it was only her fellow servants that had seen her naked, and the butler's two terrible friends. Her cheeks flushed again, but she remained silent, listening intently. She took a deep breath, knowing that her exposure would be even greater once Mr. Eden and his friend arrived. The thought filled her with dread, but she also knew that she needed to maintain her composure.
<br><br>
"He is Sir Richard's nephew, so I suppose we have to give them the two best rooms," the chambermaid continued.
<br><br>
"The green bedroom for Mr. Eden and the gold parlor for his friend then."
<br><br>
Even though she had been extremely helpful, Marianne the chambermaid had, as most of the other servants, gradually got into the spirit of devising new awkward situations for Charmaine as a way of communal entertainment. "You can help me prepare the rooms after breakfast, Charmaine," she continued. "Mr. Paine said you need more practice with tasks outside of the kitchen."
<br><br>
Charmaine bit her lip, trying to hide her anxiety. After breakfast, she followed Marianne into the master's wing and the first of the guest rooms.
<br><br>
As they set about preparing the rooms, Charmaine could not help but feel increasingly uncomfortable. Her heart hammered in her chest, and her palms were sweaty. She knew that Mr. Eden and his friend would soon arrive, and the thought filled her with dread. Marianne was not helping either, constantly demanding that Charmaine cleaned this or picked up that, making her constantly bend or even crawl under beds in positions exposing her nudity from all sort of new angles.
<br><br>
Charmaine wanted to cry. The pressure was getting to her. What if the guests came earlier and saw her? Her thoughts began to spiral out of control, as she tried her best to focus on the task at hand. She was perched high on a stool, diligently wiping dust off the end of a curtain rod in the gold parlor, holding a wet cloth with Marianne below her holding up a small bucket of water, openly staring between Charmaine's legs.
<br><br>
A knock at the door startled her, causing her to lose her balance. She teetered precariously on the stool before regaining her footing. Her face red with embarrassment, she glared at the door. Marianne, without missing a beat, answered it, leaving Charmaine waiting high up on the stool.
<br><br>
It was another chambermaid, who turned her back back to the room and called into the corridor: "Yes, Mr. Paine, they are both in the green room." Soon enough, the butler himself walked in.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine observed Charmaine's situation with delight and, with a smirk, ordered her to continue with her task. "That will teach you to stand on such a high place, young lady," he remarked. "You shouldn't be afraid of heights, right?," added Mr. Paine, a hint of sarcasm in his voice.
<br><br>
Blushing furiously, Charmaine attempted to compose herself, continuing her work. She desperately wished she could escape the humiliation, but Mr. Paine's presence made any attempts futile. He, too, unashamedly stared between her legs as she stretched up to reach the end of the rod. When she came down and moved the stool to reach the other part of the rod, she had to turn her back to him and felt his gaze burning into her bottom, which - even though she could not see him - she was sure he was inspecting as intently.
<br><br>
The room was hot, and she felt the perspiration trickle down her spine, which only served to amplify her embarrassment. This was exactly how Mr. Paine wanted it to be. He loved watching Charmaine squirm, and he enjoyed using his power to make her life miserable.
<br><br>
When she was done, she turned to hand the cloth to Marianne and discovered that she could not climb down from the stool, as the butler had now stepped right next to it, blocking her way down. Staring directly at her slit again, he gave her the news she most feared.
<br><br>
"Mr. Eden and his friend will be arriving within the hour. You have shown yourself competent enough to work in the master's wing of the manor, so you will be meeting them and showcasing your abilities to serve them."
<br><br>
Her heart plummeted to her feet. The very thought of Mr. Eden and his friend seeing her in this state sent shivers down her spine. With trembling hands, she tried to adjust her position, covering herself as much as possible.
<br><br>
The other maids watched her, both grinning with amusement.
<br><br>
"But... but...," stammered Charmaine, "I am naked. They will see me like this." Then, with an afterthought, she added, "Sir?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I know you are naked. I am sure they will have no problem with this fact, girl. And, speaking for the household, neither do I." Mr. Paine replied with a sinister smile.
<br><br>
Charmaine stood before him, tears welling in her eyes. It was not just shame and embarrassment that caused them, but also a profound fear. If Mr. Eden and his friend saw her like this, what might happen next? She felt utterly helpless.
<br><br>
The other maid, however, appeared unfazed by Charmaine's distress. "Well, better you than any of us," she snorted.
<br><br>
"We've been told to treat you as one of our own, and to ensure you become more comfortable in your role. But, it seems that we won't be needing to arrange your dress anymore, which is a small blessing. Mr. Eden and his friend will appreciate your service in whatever state you are in."
<br><br>
Desperate and on the verge of tears, Charmaine felt trapped, with no option but to comply. She nodded weakly, knowing that her only hope was to perform her duties flawlessly.
<br><br>
The clock ticked away mercilessly, and the time finally arrived.  Mr. Eden and his friend were expected any moment. "Come with me, Charmaine," said the butler when the door bell chimed." It's time to meet the important visitors."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, feeling like her world was spinning. She tried to gather her courage as she hurried behind Mr. Paine, wondering what awaited her.
<br><br>
Without giving her a moment to compose herself, the butler pulled open the door, revealing two waiting gentlemen in travel attire, with their footman standing tall next to a pile of large leather bags behind them.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden looked the embodiment of wealth and privilege, with an air of confidence and command. His companion, however, seemed less affluent but equally intriguing in his appearance, with an aura of mystery surrounding him. Charmaine could feel her pulse racing as they gaped at the site of her luscious body completely exposed, their gazes frozen, all three men seemingly unable to speak.
<br><br>
"This is Charmaine," said the butler. "She will be your chamber maid for the duration of your stay. Please do not mind her appearance, she is having a bit of a lesson. I hope you gentlemen are not offended by a bit of old-fashioned discipline."
<br><br>
With a smirk, he gestured towards Charmaine, whose face burned crimson. She had not expected the butler to introduce her in such a manner, and the humiliation was almost overwhelming.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden glanced at Charmaine, taking in her exposed form. Despite her vulnerability, there was something captivating about her innocence and beauty. He couldn't help but notice how her long blonde hair cascaded down her back, framing her curvaceous figure and soft features. The novelty of her embarrassing predicament was undeniably enticing, despite his initial shock. Meanwhile, his friend seemed even more intrigued by the unfolding scenario. "Do tell us a bit more, eh, Paine?" he asked, eyeing Charmaine curiously.
<br><br>
Mr. Paine smiled, taking a step closer to the group. "Charmaine here is relatively new to our household. She showed herself unacceptably tardy and had to be punished for it. In the absence of Sir Richard, I was left with full responsibility for the place and decided that extreme measures were in order. I hope he will not find anything amiss in my decision when he returns the day after tomorrow."
<br><br>
"In the meantime, she will continue her work in the state that she is."
<br><br>
Mr. Eden chuckled slightly at Charmaine's predicament. "Well, she certainly isn't short on natural assets, that's for certain, she has nothing to be ashamed of," he mused, his eyes wandering over her exposed form once more.
<br><br>
"However, do you think she'd be willing to do a bit more than her regular chores?," the mystery friend interjected.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden raised an eyebrow at his friend's suggestion, intrigued by the prospect. "And what do you have in mind?" he asked cautiously.
<br><br>
"Oh, nothing too risqué," his friend replied with a mischievous smile.
<br><br>
"Just an opportunity for Charmaine to explore her skills beyond the usual housekeeping tasks. After all, she's quite an attractive girl, and we should take advantage of such opportunities while they present themselves."
<br><br>
Mr. Paine considered the question, weighing the possibilities. He knew that Charmaine's vulnerable state made her susceptible to manipulation, and the chance to exploit her naivety and beauty held undeniable appeal. Yet, he didn't want to upset the delicate balance of authority within the household.
<br><br>
"Perhaps, Miss Charmaine would be more inclined to indulge your curiosity if it wasn't too risky," he proposed diplomatically.
<br><br>
Charmaine's face flushed with confusion and anxiety. She did not understand what these wealthy gentlemen's suddenly express interest in her would entail. As her mind raced with questions, the butler offered to assist in clearing up any misunderstandings. "My dear Miss Charmaine, there's no need to worry," he assured her with a tone of insincerity.
<br><br>
"Your duties will remain confined to your responsibilities as a housemaid. The gentlemen simply wish to engage in a harmless experiment involving your talents, nothing more, I am sure."
<br><br>
"Go ahead, Charmaine," the butler instructed, maintaining his facade of calm.
<br><br>
"Show our guests around the estate and make sure they are comfortable. I trust you to demonstrate your worth."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart raced as she attempted to compose herself. "Yes, sir," she answered hesitantly, trying to appear confident despite her anxiety. Her mind raced with questions about what exactly was expected of her, but she resolved to follow the butler's orders and try her best to impress Mr. Eden and his friend.
<br><br>
As Charmaine led the distinguished visitors through the grand halls, she found herself increasingly aware of the curious gaze of Mr. Eden, which seemed riveted to the lower part of her backside.
<br><br>
Despite her growing discomfort, Charmaine continued to lead them through the estate, pointing out various rooms and describing what each room's purpose was. Mr. Eden and his friend listened with apparent fascination, observing Charmaine's every movement and gesture.
<br><br>
As they entered the library, Charmaine noticed that the butler had followed them, remaining close enough to keep an eye on everything. This heightened her sense of unease, but she kept her composure, focusing on answering their questions and performing her duties as requested.
<br><br>
"Show the gentlemen to their rooms, Charmaine", Mr. Paine said, "and arrange their luggage."
<br><br>
Charmaine obeyed, leading the gentlemen to their respective rooms.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden studied Charmaine intently, admiring her graceful movements and the gentle sway of her hips. He couldn't help but fantasize about exploring her curves further. His friend, meanwhile, appeared transfixed by her innocent nature and the thought of experiencing her true innocence firsthand.
<br><br>
She was happy to have a moment's respite when she turned her back to them and walked down the corridor towards the entrance, there to collect their luggage.
<br><br>
Their footman was, she discovered, still there - no doubt hoping to get another view of her. His hope was rewarded when she walked out of the house and into the front yard.
<br><br>
Basking in the sunlight, she bent down to pick up the luggage, allowing him a perfect view of her exposed hanging breasts. One by one, Charmaine carefully collected the heavy bags, arranging them neatly beside the door.
<br><br>
"There is more," the footman helpfully added. "On the roof of the carriage".
<br><br>
She looked in frustration at the enormously tall carriage. Sure enough, some packages were strapped to its roof.
<br><br>
"How can I get them down?," she asked, fully aware that there was no point asking him to take the luggage down himself. He did not look like a man who would miss a chance of seeing her struggle in the undoubtedly indecent positions she would need to assume to accomplish the task.
<br><br>
"I can help you," the footman offered eagerly.
<br><br>
He grinned, eager to watch Charmaine struggle. The footman stepped aside, making way for her. With a deep breath, Charmaine approached the carriage. Her hands shook nervously as she grabbed hold of the edge, lifting herself onto the steps of the carriage. She tried to reach the packages, but of course was not tall enough to get a good grip on them and haul them down.
<br><br>
"You got to untie them first," the footman explained helpfully. "And you need to reach much higher. You'll need to step on the wheel."
<br><br>
The footman's voice was thick with anticipation. It was clear he was looking forward to watching Charmaine struggle and expose herself further. She knew why - she had seen how the footmen do it.
<br><br>
She put her left foot on the top of the carriage wheel, and raised her right foot to a small metal bracket on the wall of the carriage. Her left leg was now stretched to the left, her right foot high above on the right, and the footman was directly below staring between her legs.
<br><br>
"Hold onto the edge, Charmaine," the footman directed, clearly enjoying the view. "Pull yourself up higher."
<br><br>
As she hoisted herself upwards, the footman watched hungrily, clearly relishing the sight. She could feel her face burning with shame and anger, her pulse quickening as she struggled to maintain her balance.
<br><br>
Finally, she managed to reach the packages, her arms aching from the effort.
<br><br>
Slowly, she untied the ropes holding them in place. As she worked, she could hear the footman's steady breathing below her, feeling his gaze upon her as she balanced precariously on the carriage.
<br><br>
Charmaine felt violated, as she had not felt the day before when she was in the same position with James.
<br><br>
She passed a package to the footman and slowly climbed down, careful not to give him any indication that she needed his help. The thought of his hands on her felt repulsive.
<br><br>
The naked maid now had to repeat the operation on the other side of the carriage, a process that was no less humiliating for her than the first one. The footman, unable to resist the temptation, lingered behind her, feasting his eyes on her nudity with an insatiable appetite.
<br><br>
When all the packages were safely removed from the carriage, the footman offered to assist her in carrying them into the house. Charmaine, unwilling to risk further exposure, politely declined his offer, stating that she could manage it herself. With shaking hands, she gathered the packages and carried them inside.
<br><br>
She sighed a huge sigh of relief when she finally closed the front door in his leering face.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 10 [Formal Dinner (Saturday Night)] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
One by one, the naked Charmaine carried the heavy bags through the corridors and up the stairs. Young Mr. Eden and his friend were sitting in plush chairs in the green guestroom, smoking and observing her movements in delight.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden took a puff of his cigar, then blew out smoke rings, watching them dissipate lazily in the air. His eyes rested on Charmaine, appreciating her lithe body. "Amazing, isn't she?" he remarked to his friend. His friend nodded in agreement, taking another drag from his cigar. "Indeed, my dear fellow. And just imagine how enjoyable it must be for her to serve us completely naked! I wonder if she ever imagined serving gentlemen such as us in this state."
<br><br>
"I wouldn't think so," his friend replied, his eyes glinting with excitement. "But now, she seems to have embraced her role quite well, considering the circumstances."
<br><br>
Trying not to think of their remarks, Charmaine continued working until she brought the final bag upstairs. She was not left wondering what do next, when Mr. Eden casually said, "you can unpack my bags first, Charmaine, and then you can do Henry's".
<br><br>
He smiled indulgently, knowing full well that his request was not merely a suggestion.
<br><br>
Charmaine took a deep breath and began unpacking his bags. The room was filled with the sounds of clothes being carefully folded, shoes being neatly arranged, and items being meticulously placed into drawers. Charmaine was doing her best to ensure that she performed her task efficiently, hoping to minimize the time spent in their presence in her vulnerable state.
<br><br>
As she went about her work, Mr. Eden watched with interest, observing her movements and facial expressions. He noticed the slight flush in her cheeks, evidence of her discomfort at the relentless scrutiny of her nudity by these two well-dressed men.
<br><br>
As Charmaine finished unpacking Mr. Eden's bags, she turned her attention to his friend's belongings.
<br><br>
The two young gentlemen followed the naked Charmaine into the next room, where Henry's bags waited.
<br><br>
As she proceeded to unpack his things, Charmaine couldn't help but notice the growing intensity in the room. Both Mr. Eden and his friend seemed more fascinated by her every move, watching her carefully, as if trying to learn every aspect of her routine. Despite her efforts to remain focused on her tasks, their scrutiny only increased her anxiety and sense of helplessness.
<br><br>
It was clear they enjoyed having Charmaine perform her chores in the nude.
<br><br>
Young Mr. Eden and his friend continued to observe her movements, their eyes never leaving her as she unpacked the last of the bags. Mr. Eden spoke softly, "This is quite amusing, don't you agree? I wonder how long we should continue allowing her to serve us like this."
<br><br>
His friend chuckled, "I say we let her carry on for now. It certainly makes our stay here much more entertaining!"
<br><br>
Charmaine blushed, feeling exposed and powerless.
<br><br>
She hastily fled the room when she was done unpacking. However, the butler sought her out in the kitchen shortly afterward. "There you are, Charmaine," he scolded, his voice booming throughout the entire space. "You know better than to leave your duties unfinished. Did you forget that dinner needs to be served to the gentlemen?"
<br><br>
Her heart raced as she hurried back to the guestroom, wondering how she would be able to face them again without the slightest hint of modesty. Upon entering the room, both Mr. Eden and his friend were seated comfortably in their chairs, smiling expectantly at her arrival.
<br><br>
"It is time for dinner, Sirs," Charmaine announced nervously, her voice trembling slightly. She was acutely aware of her bare body and the fact that there was no way to hide it from the guests.
<br><br>
"Dinner will be served in the small dining room."
<br><br>
Charmaine attempted to maintain composure despite her embarrassment. She knew that the butler could have assigned the task to another maid but had purposely given her the job of serving dinner naked, ensuring that the guests would enjoy a further show.
<br><br>
To her surprise, the butler was also present in the dining room and remained there for the entire dinner.
<br><br>
It was clear that he wanted to witness Charmaine's performance, relishing in her humiliation. However, his presence also dampened somewhat the enthusiasm of the two guests to experiment with pushing Charmaine's limits further. He even went so far as to casually mention the expected return of Sir Richard, no doubt to remind them to behave themselves in his house.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden had arrived to ask his uncle for the loan of a substantial amount of money, which he knew that his uncle knew he would never be able to repay. Thus, it was in his best interests to stay in Sir Richard's good books, at least until after the transaction was complete.
<br><br>
With her head held high, Charmaine began serving the meal, attempting to ignore the ogling gaze of Mr. Eden and his friend. Her arms moved swiftly as she effortlessly balanced serving plates, pouring wine, and answering questions about the menu.
<br><br>
Throughout the meal, the guests made several attempts to make Charmaine feel even more uncomfortable by complimenting her body or asking personal questions.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden was particularly insistent, enjoying the opportunity to tease her. As she served them dessert, Charmaine felt her confidence faltering under their unwelcome attentions. Yet, she refused to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break down. Instead, she focused on completing her duties as quickly as possible, determined to survive this ordeal without compromising her dignity.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden spoke teasingly, "We appreciate all your hard work, Miss Charmaine, especially considering the... unique nature of your attire tonight." His friend chimed in, laughing and adding, "Yes, indeed. How does it feel to serve us like this?"
<br><br>
Charmaine forced herself to smile and reply graciously, "It's just an my job, sirs."
<br><br>
As she served them dessert, Charmaine felt her confidence faltering under their unwelcome attentions. Yet, she refused to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break down. Instead, she focused on completing her duties as quickly as possible, determined to survive this ordeal without compromising her dignity.
<br><br>
Despite her determination, Charmaine could tell that her composure was wavering. She struggled to maintain eye contact with the guests, choosing instead to focus on her tasks.
<br><br>
After serving dessert, Charmaine offered to bring tea and coffee for the gentlemen. While pouring the coffee, she heard Mr. Eden and his friend discussing their plans for later in the evening.
<br><br>
"What shall we do tonight, Henry?" Mr. Eden asked.
<br><br>
"Well, it depends on what Miss Charmaine has planned for the evening. Maybe we could convince her to join us for a nightcap? She could even be persuaded to tuck me into bed?"
<br><br>
The butler had positioned himself in the room precisely in order to deflect such ideas though.
<br><br>
"Indeed, it is late in the evening and time for bed already," he announced. "Charmaine, clear up the table and go back to your room. I want you ready for an early start tomorrow."
<br><br>
With a sigh of relief, Charmaine collected the empty plates and cups, stacking them neatly onto the tray. She carried the tray to the kitchen, trying her best to keep her balance despite the weight. Back in the dining room, she cleared away the remaining dirty dishes, making sure the room was spotless before finally returning to her own quarters.
<br><br>
Exhausted, Charmaine collapsed onto her bed, unable to shake off the events of the day. Her heart still racing, she replayed the day's encounters in her mind, struggling to comprehend why she had been subjected to such humiliating treatment.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 11 [The Naked Picnic (Sunday)] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
Sunday breakfast was uneventful. Most of the staff were preparing for church service in the nearby village. The nude Charmaine, however, was the exception.
<br><br>
She felt her heart pounding in her chest as she hurried through the morning chores. She had no idea what she could do during the day, but the question was soon answered for her when the butler entered the large kitchen.
<br><br>
"Ah, Charmaine..," his voice was heavy with irony as his gaze explored her fully exposed body from head to toe. "I presume you do not plan to go to church today, attired as you are?"
<br><br>
The butler's tone was taunting, knowing full well that Charmaine was trapped within the confines of the estate.
<br><br>
Charmaine blanched at the idea and swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear and frustration. "No, sir, I cannot attend today," she replied, trying her best to maintain her composure.
<br><br>
"And what do you intend to do instead?" The butler raised his eyebrows in feigned curiosity, taking pleasure in tormenting her further.
<br><br>
"I... I don't know, Sir," she stammered.
<br><br>
"Very well then. I know that Sunday is God's given day for rest, but nevertheless there are things to be done around the house and someone needs to do them. We have the two noble guests to take care of, and given that you have no other plans for the day, you can have the job of entertaining them today. I am sure they will find this arrangement agreeable."
<br><br>
The butler's statement left little doubt about the fate awaiting Charmaine for the remainder of the day. It seemed that the gentlemen visitors were to be entertained yet again, and she would be the centerpiece of their attentions.
<br><br>
Charmaine bit her lip, knowing there was nothing she could do to escape her predicament. She tried to appear resigned to her fate as she listened to the butler's instructions.
<br><br>
"We have beautiful weather today. Inform Mr. Eden and his friend that their morning tea will be served outside," he ordered with a mischievous light in his eyes.
<br><br>
"They can enjoy the beautiful sunshine and perhaps take part in some outdoor activities later. You may need to assist them in these activities. You are already 'dressed' for the occasion."
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded silently, feeling a mix of dread and apprehension at the thought of spending the entire day with the unscrupulous guests, in her state of permanent nudity.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, she knew better than to protest against the butler's orders. She gathered her courage and set off towards the guests' quarters, to inform the gentlemen of the day's plans.
<br><br>
As she approached, she could hear the muffled sounds of laughter coming from one of the rooms, and her heart thumped faster in anticipation of what might come next. Taking a deep breath, she knocked softly on the door.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden opened the door, his eyes widening as he took in Charmaine's vulnerable state. He looked over her shoulder to where the butler stood, watching discreetly from a distance. He turned back to Charmaine with a playful grin.
<br><br>
"Ah, Charmaine, how delightful! And quite unexpected. It seems the day’s activities are going to involve more than just tea and cakes."
<br><br>
"Good morning, Mr. Eden, Mr. Henry. I hope you're enjoying your stay here at the manor. I wanted to let you know that your morning tea will be served outside, due to the lovely weather we're having today."
<br><br>
"And..," she hesitated but then continued after meeting the stern gaze of the butler, "Perhaps you would both like to participate in some outdoor activities later."
<br><br>
Mr. Eden's eyes lit up at her suggestion, as if a new idea had just occurred to him. "That's an excellent suggestion, Charmaine. How about we start with a leisurely stroll through the gardens? It's a beautiful day for it."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed nervously, knowing what this meant. "Of course, Mr. Eden."
<br><br>
"That sounds lovely. And then, we can think of what else we may do...," Mr. Eden cast a questioning look at the butler, who interpreted it correctly.
<br><br>
"As I mentioned before, Sir Richard will not have a scandal in his household. Look any way you want, but no touching. Gentlemen."
<br><br>
Mr. Eden agreed, his eyes alight with excitement. "Yes, yes, that sounds reasonable. Let's have breakfast now and waste no more time in chit-chat. We should certainly make the most of this glorious day."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank at the thought of spending hours in close proximity to the lecherous guests, forced to fulfill their every whim while they ogled her body. She tried to remain composed, mustering all her strength to conceal her growing anxiety.
<br><br>
The butler smirked, satisfied with the arrangement.
<br><br>
He watched as Charmaine led the men through the house and outside, her steps faltering with trepidation beneath her feet. As they entered the vast formal garden, the bright sunlight illuminated Charmaine's skin, causing it to glow with a warm hue. The breeze played teasingly with her hair, tousling it in ways that only added to her sense of vulnerability. The men followed closely behind, their eyes fixated on her curves.
<br><br>
A small dining table awaited them under a tree, where they sat down to enjoy their lavish breakfast. Charmaine served them with poise, but her trembling hands betrayed her inner turmoil.
<br><br>
The cool air that brushed against her skin was a stark contrast to the heat of the men's gazes that followed her every movement. The light breeze was a constant reminder that not only was she naked in the presence of these men, but was also out in the open, away from the familiar safety of the manor.
<br><br>
After breakfast, the guests and their nude companion set out to explore the manor's extensive grounds. Mr. Eden continued to feast his eyes on Charmaine's forms. His thoughts drifted to the games he intended to play, fueled by the thrill of indulging in forbidden desires.
<br><br>
His mind was filled with images of Charmaine bound in various poses, obedient to his every command. He imagined her quivering with fear and arousal, her eyes wide with shock and desire. The intensity of his fantasies increased as they ventured deeper into the garden, the rustling leaves creating a symphony of sensual whispers.
<br><br>
Charmaine tried to dispel the tension by talking about the landscaping around the manor, pointing the various flower beds and decorative bushes as they passed them by.
<br><br>
Her attempts were met with indifference by the guests, whose minds were far from the beauty of nature surrounding them.
<br><br>
Their attention remained firmly fixed on Charmaine's body. Despite her efforts to distract them with stories of the manor's history, Mr. Eden and his friend were not interested in the past; they were captivated by the present.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden's eyes danced with mischief as he contemplated the games he wished to play. A secluded meadow sparked his interest and crystalized his intentions.
<br><br>
"It's almost lunch time," he said. "Let's have a picnic here."
<br><br>
The meadow was lush and green, and quite secluded from the rest of the estate. Mr. Eden chose this spot deliberately, knowing that it offered a perfect setting for his intended lewd games. The grass swayed gently in the breeze, its sweet fragrance filling the air. The sun shone overhead, casting dappled shadows across the landscape.
<br><br>
Charmaine felt her cheeks flush as she realized the guests' intentions. She could see the excitement in their eyes, a mixture of lust and anticipation.
<br><br>
This was not going to be a simple picnic; it was going to be a perverse game of power, where Charmaine would be the prize. With her heart pounding in her chest, she felt a sudden surge of adrenaline as she understood the gravity of the situation.
<br><br>
"Well, Charmaine, why don't you bring a picnic blanket and our lunch to our private meadow?" Mr. Eden suggested, his voice laced with deviousness.
<br><br>
The gentlemen did not have much appetite for food though, their appetite was for something else entirely.
<br><br>
As Charmaine brought the basket and the blanket, her heart raced even faster. The sound of birds singing in the trees echoed in her ears, creating a surreal ambiance.
<br><br>
Her knees trembled slightly as she spread the picnic blanket upon the lush grass. Her skin was sensitive to the warmth of the sun as it caressed her body, bringing forth a gentle prickling sensation.
<br><br>
As the guests settled themselves comfortably onto the blanket, Mr. Eden's eyes gleamed with sinister intent. "Charmaine, dear, wouldn't you prefer being dressed for such a lovely day?" he asked, his tone laced with mock innocence.
<br><br>
"Isn't it awfully cold without clothes? Wouldn't you like to wear something warmer?"
<br><br>
Charmaine's face flushed red with anger and humiliation. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. "I… I don't think so, sir. I am fine as I am," she answered hesitantly, not sure where that line of inquiry would lead.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden's eyes narrowed, an air of challenge in his demeanor. "Are you certain, Charmaine? You like being nude?" His tone was dripping with sarcasm.
<br><br>
"You find it quite comfortable? Then by all means, continue as you are. It's a lovely day, after all." He paused, giving Charmaine a predatory smile. "Enjoy it while you can. My friend and I certainly do not mind."
<br><br>
Without waiting for her reply, Mr. Eden grabbed a bottle of wine from the picnic basket, opening it with ease. He poured himself a glass, taking a generous sip.
<br><br>
"So, Charmaine, what would you say if I told you we could make this a bit more interesting?" His eyes twinkled with devilish mischief, as he reached out to pour another glass for himself.
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, struggling to maintain her composure. "What do you mean, sir?"
<br><br>
Mr. Eden took another sip of his wine, savoring the taste. "Oh, nothing too risqué. Just an innocent little game to add a bit of fun to our picnic." Mr. Eden chuckled, his voice thick with malice. "Something to help break the monotony of our regular routine, don't you agree, Charmaine?"
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew she had to find a way to escape this situation without causing a scandal or risking her position at the manor. But her mind went blank, her thoughts tangled in confusion and fear.
<br><br>
"But, sir... What kind of game?" She stammered, unable to meet his eyes.
<br><br>
"Nothing overly elaborate," Mr. Eden replied casually, pouring himself another glass of wine. "Just something to keep things interesting. To while the afternoon away, you understand."
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, trying to find the courage to speak up against the indecent proposal. But her heart raced, her palms sweaty. She knew that voicing her refusal might lead to dire consequences.
<br><br>
"The game I have in mind, Charmaine, involves a series of tasks for you to perform." His tone grew darker with each word, his eyes burning with unbridled lust. "I assure you, they won't be anything Mr. Paine would object to."
<br><br>
This wasn't much of a reassurance. Charmaine swallowed hard, trying to process the implications of his words. She knew that accepting his proposal would be crossing a line she never wanted to cross. Yet, rejecting it would undoubtedly result in severe repercussions.
<br><br>
"What kind of tasks would these be, Sir?" Charmaine managed to ask, her voice wavering.
<br><br>
"Well, my dear," Mr. Eden responded with a sinister grin, "you will stand naked in front of us and perform various acts, all meant to entertain us. Simple tasks designed to please our eyes and perhaps stimulate our senses."
<br><br>
His words sent shivers down Charmaine's spine.
<br><br>
She knew that there was no turning back once she agreed to his wicked game, but there was no way to refuse. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself, determined to face whatever came her way.
<br><br>
"Very well, sir," Charmaine replied hesitantly, her voice barely above a whisper.
<br><br>
"Then let's begin!" Mr. Eden declared enthusiastically, pouring himself another glass of wine. "Our first task for our fair Charmaine is to assume a standing position. And you know, Charmaine, since you are already naked, it should pose no problem for you, right?" He smirked at her, his expression teeming with malevolence.
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed, her heart racing in her chest. Nodding her head, she mustered up the courage to speak up again. "Alright, sir. If that's what you wish, then I shall comply," Charmaine responded, her voice steady despite her trembling insides.
<br><br>
Mr. Eden raised his glass in salute, his lips curved into a sinister smile. "Excellent, Charmaine! Now, remember, we expect complete obedience and precise performance from you. Is that clear?"
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded again, trying to mask her terror behind a façade of resignation. She stood still, her heart thumping wildly in her chest, waiting for the next command.
<br><br>
"Now, Charmaine," Mr. Eden began, his voice carrying a sinister undertone, "let's start with something simple. We want you to show us your most seductive walk." Charmaine had to endure walking around in various styles under the guest's intense scrutiny. Then, various styles of running was also demanded, from a slow trot to a full-on sprint.
<br><br>
Each new task seemed to grow increasingly daring and uncomfortable. Tasks that would have been considered scandalous if performed in public. One moment she was holding her breasts and doing a "knees high" run, and the next she was marching like a soldier at parade.They had her lean stretching her arms forward, then bend over to touch her toes, then arching her back, exposing her lower body completely. Each position was held longer than necessary, testing her endurance and pushing her boundaries, while the men walked around her viewing her at leisure from all angles.
<br><br>
The guests watched her intently, making comments and suggestions throughout the entire performance. They directed her movements, demanding changes and variations to satisfy their ever increasing curiosity.
<br><br>
The men developed a fascination with the way that gravity played with her full breasts, watching as they jiggled with every movement - walking, running or jumping up and down, and changed shape with the various poses she took.
<br><br>
Their demands became increasingly obscene, their eyes fixating on her body, making her feel violated and exposed.
<br><br>
Each task seemed to get progressively worse, pushing Charmaine further and further out of her comfort zone. She crawled on all fours, first low then with her buttocks high in the air. She spread her legs wide and bent to grasp her ankles, showing the men views they had not dreamed of before.
<br><br>
Lying on her back on the blanket, she lifted her legs up and extended them outward, placing her feet flat on the ground, forming a 'V'. She then moved her hands to her sides, lifting her bottom to display her cleft, giving the men yet another enticing view. She pressed her knees against her breasts and, and - as if that was not bad enough - pushed her knees as far apart as the could possibly go. She lay there obscenely on display like this, while the men discussed what else they could demand of her.
<br><br>
Their ideas grew increasingly depraved and explicit, forcing Charmaine to question whether she could go through with their demands. Each request pushed her to the brink of physical and mental exhaustion, her cheeks flushing crimson from shame and exertion.
<br><br>
Mr. Henry put to practice his experience with calisthenics, ordering Charmaine to perform various spreads, pushups, lunges, squats, jumping jacks, and planks. As Charmaine struggled to perform these rigorous exercises, he explained their finer points to Mr. Eden, using Charmaine as a human demonstration doll. They even helped her to a handstand, holding her ankles for support, and could not resist the temptation of spreading her legs wide apart while she was upside down. This was clearly going beyond any limits of decency.
<br><br>
As the afternoon wore on, her exhaustion made her motions less precise and her movements clumsier. Sweat covered her body as she fought to remain composed amidst the escalating demands.
<br><br>
The sun had almost dipped below the horizon, casting an eerie glow over the meadow. Charmaine was no longer able to ignore the fact that this had gone far beyond mere entertainment, and she felt increasingly anxious about the direction this was heading.
<br><br>
It was Mr. Paine who finally ended the nightmare. He came to the meadow and announced that dinner was served for the gentlemen, and would they follow him into the house? To Charmaine's amazement, he gave no indication that she should follow them, so she just stayed there on the grass in a state of mental and emotional exhaustion.
<br><br>
The men eventually disappeared into the house, leaving Charmaine alone in the meadow. She stared blankly into the distance, feeling numb and unsure of what had transpired in the past few hours.
<br><br>
With slow and insecure steps, she walked back towards the manor. She had no mental strength left to enter the kitchen and meet the gazes of her fellow servants.
<br><br>
Forgoing dinner, she went straight to her room and cried herself to sleep.
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 12 [Day Eight of Charmaine's Naked Week] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
In the dim light of the kitchen, Charmaine sat huddled in a corner, attempting to recover from the traumatic events of the previous day. Her thoughts were a chaotic mix of fear, humiliation, and helplessness. She was aware that she needed to regain some sense of normalcy, but how could she do that when her entire world had been turned upside down?
<br><br>
The butler had given her an extraordinary punishment - to work naked for a week. The week was now over and she hoped to finally get her clothes back.
<br><br>
Throughout the week, the other staff noticed her condition but avoided any mention of it. It was evident that everyone in the house had witnessed her humiliation, and none of them spoke a word about it. In the first days of her ordeal, some had even made it worse for her by inventing small tasks that would expose her even more, but this had now abated.
<br><br>
After staff breakfast, Charmaine stayed in the kitchen to help the cook. The butler had not sent her to entertain their two distinguished guests today and she was grateful for it. She had not seen Mr. Paine since the day before, and was eagerly expecting him to come and tell her when she could retrieve her clothes.
<br><br>
However, events developed quite differently. During lunch, a commotion outside made everyone aware that Sir Richard's carriage had arrived. Not long after, the butler entered the kitchen and motioned Charmaine to follow him. His stern countenance suggested that important things were afoot. Her hope surged as she followed him toward the large library, which Sir Richard used for his study.
<br><br>
At the same time, Charmaine was mortified. She was still bare naked, the area between her legs cleanly shaved. Did Mr. Paine intend to present her to the lord of the manor in this state?
<br><br>
To her horror, she discovered that indeed he did. The butler knocked discreetly on the library's door and entered. Shortly after that, he invited the trembling maid in.
<br><br>
Entering the room, Charmaine saw Sir Richard sitting behind his desk, examining some papers. His eyes briefly met hers, causing her heart to race with anticipation. Would he take pity on her and allow her to retrieve her clothes?
<br><br>
The butler directed her to wait near the door. After several minutes of studying some documents, Sir Richard finally looked her thoroughly up and down, and addressed her.
<br><br>
"Charmaine," he said, his tone both authoritative and condescending. "Mr. Paine has told me about you, and about the little lesson he decided to give you. He asked for my opinion and I decided to see you before I make up my mind."
<br><br>
His words echoed in her ears, as her heart beat rapidly. There was nothing she could say, because whatever response she made might affect her future within the household. With tears threatening to spill, she kept her head bowed, unable to look directly at either of them.
<br><br>
Sir Richard continued, "You know, Charmaine, you are quite an interesting girl. Mr. Paine claims that despite your state of constant nudity - or, perhaps, exactly because of it - you have made amazing progress in learning the duties of a housemaid. He believes that you have shown determination and a willingness to learn, qualities that should be rewarded."
<br><br>
Charmaine's face burned red, as she tried to hide her embarrassment under a false smile.
<br><br>
Sir Richard observed her reaction carefully, considering how to proceed.
<br><br>
"Mr. Paine has offered to make a demonstration of your skills. Of course, I trust his judgement implicitly and told him that this would not be required, but he convinced me to test you myself."
<br><br>
Sir Richard paused, allowing his words to sink in. Charmaine's eyes widened in disbelief. She couldn't believe that she was actually going to have to demonstrate her skills for the most important person not only in this house, but in the whole county. Her heart raced, knowing that this could make or break her future within the manor. She desperately wished that she could be dressed, and not have to do this demonstration as she was, completely naked.
<br><br>
Sir Richard continued, "Please show us, Charmaine, how well you have learned your duties."
<br><br>
Sir Richard's voice held a tone of amusement, and Charmaine's heart sank even lower. There was no escape from this. She would have to demonstrate her skills, regardless of how embarrassing and humiliating it would be.
<br><br>
She poured him a cup of tea and tried to keep her face neutral, avoiding eye contact. The butler then sent her to the kitchen to bring the lord's lunch, which she served as she had been taught. Throughout this time, Sir Richard watched closely, scrutinizing every detail of her performance.
<br><br>
He made no comment, which she took for approval. While the lord had his lunch, she stood dutifully near the wall in the pose she had been taught, hands behind her back, feet one foot apart.
<br><br>
When Sir Richard finished his lunch and she cleaned up the table, the butler  praised her cleaning skills next and had her bring the tools of her trade.
<br><br>
Her cheeks burned with embarrassment as she carried in a broom, dustpan, mop, bucket, and various rags. As she arranged them neatly on the floor, Sir Richard examined her with a critical eye.
<br><br>
She started by dusting the desk and the furniture, her movements slow and deliberate. As she was leaning across the desk, Charmaine was acutely aware of Sir Richard's face inches from her bare breasts swaying slightly with her movements. Her skin prickled with a mix of shame and arousal, the latter of which she hadn't expected.
<br><br>
Next, she moved onto the chairs. Taking extra care, she gently brushed off every speck of dust, all the while trying to maintain eye contact with neither of them. For the bookshelves, she needed to climb on a small stool to reachthe higher shelves. She balanced precariously, adjusting her grip to keep her balance as her body shifted.
<br><br>
The lord of the manor got up from his chair and stood in the center of the room, to observe her efforts - and her firm backside - from a better point of view.
<br><br>
The floor was already meticulously clean, but she had to demonstrate her expertise in every aspect of her job and started cleaning it anyway.
<br><br>
The men watched as she gracefully swung the broom and smoothly swept the imaginary dirt from the floor. Their intense gaze seemed to unnerve her, yet she managed to remain focused on her task.
<br><br>
She picked up the mop and began to moisten it, applying it expertly to the polished floor.
<br><br>
When she changed position, Charmaine caught sight of herself in the large mirror nearby and was reminded of the sight she was presenting the two men, crawling on all fours, her full breasts swinging with each movement, her bottom high in the air. She knew what was expected of her and made sure to turn around and present them with a view from the rear too.
<br><br>
The butler watched her with an approving expression on his face. Sir Richard stood tall, his eyes locked on her every move, his face unreadable.
<br><br>
The butler cleared his throat, signaling that her performance was over. She remained frozen in that position, her backside turned toward the two men, while they kept looking at her, deep in thought.
<br><br>
"You can get up now," he said after an eternity of silence. The relief that washed over her quickly gave way to dread. She knew what this meant – she had passed the test. But was the punishment over?
<br><br>
As Charmaine slowly rose to her feet, her breath came out in a quiet exhale. She felt both relieved and anxious, unsure of what to expect next. Sir Richard's decision would determine her fate within the manor.
<br><br>
"Excellent," was the only thing that Sir Richard said about the performance. Or was he commenting on her luscious nude body?
<br><br>
"Send her back to the kitchen for now," he instructed the butler, "and bring in that rascal of a nephew I have been cursed with. It seems I will have to save him yet again. You know I am only doing it for the sake of his mother, my poor late sister. But then, I want him and his friend out of the house within the hour."
<br><br>
"Next, we can talk about your other request," Sir Richard added cryptically.
<br><br>
Charmaine was happy to hear that her two tormentors would be gone. But, what about her situation? Nothing had been said about her getting her clothes back.
<br><br>
It seemed that Sir Richard wanted to have a private conversation with Mr. Paine before making a decision about her situation. And what was it about another request?
<br><br>
The butler sent her to the kitchen, where she occupied her time until dinner with her regular chores, her mind in turmoil with unanswered questions.
<br><br>
Was the butler planning to continue her punishment or was there some chance of it ending soon? Would Sir Richard grant her wish to return to her previous clothes? Or worse, would he extend her current punishment, forcing her to perform her job entirely naked for longer? Her anxiety was at an all-time high, but she had no choice but to wait.
<br><br>
As the staff gathered for dinner, the topic of the day was that Lady Constance had not returned from London together with her husband. Instead, she had proceeded directly to another family estate. This was unprecedented and left the entire household with a sense of unease, wondering about its significance and speculating about it in hushed whispers.
<br><br>
Another development shook the household much more, when later the butler interrupted dinner to call on an older servant to follow him into Sir Richard's study. Everyone lingered in the kitchen after dinner to await his return, eager to find out what was happening.
<br><br>
The man looked somewhat stunned when he re-appeared after a protracted absence.
<br><br>
"Right...," he cleared his throat, all eyes riveted on him in the expectation of his news. "Mr. Paine has been granted leave to arrange some personal matters, and has already departed the house. Until his return in a couple of weeks, I will perform his duties, and you will address me as Mr. Williams for the duration."
<br><br>
His eyes sought out the naked girl. "Charmaine, follow me to Sir Richard's study, there is some other news that concerns you only."
<br><br>
Her heart pounded in her chest as she complied, feeling the weight of curiosity in the kitchen as everyone dispersed back to their tasks. The anticipation of knowing whether she would finally regain her clothes or face an extended punishment hung heavy upon her shoulders.
<br><br>
Sir Richard greeted them impassively upon entering the study. His demeanor remained cool and composed, but Charmaine detected a hint of something unsettling beneath the surface.
<br><br>
She nervously clasped her hands, waiting for whatever Sir Richard had to say.
<br><br>
"I have found your skills quite satisfactory, and will give you a chance of promotion in the household."
<br><br>
"As you know, when the family is in residence here, James is my personal valet, and Marianne is Lady Constance's chambermaid."
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded, unsure where this was going.
<br><br>
"However, Lady Constance has decided to reside elsewhere for the foreseeable future. This is quite regrettable," Sir Richard continued with a straight face, "and it also means that I cannot assign you to help Marianne with her tasks as a chambermaid, as there will be none of those any time soon."
<br><br>
"In short, I have decided to have you help James in his duties, on a probational basis. If you prove yourself capable, this may become permanent."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart skipped a beat at the prospect of being promoted so soon after joining the household. This could be her opportunity to rise above her humble beginnings and the oppressive life she led before.
<br><br>
"You may start tomorrow," Sir Richard finished, with a tone implying that she was dismissed.
<br><br>
"I am grateful for the opportunity, Sir," Charmaine found the courage to say. "But... how about my uniform?" she asked, looking down at her exposed body.
<br><br>
"What about your uniform?," Sir Richard feigned not to understand what she meant.
<br><br>
"Um... Mr. Paine said...," Charmaine stammered, "working naked for a week, and it has been a week already..."
<br><br>
"Ah...," the lord of the manor confirmed. "I can see where your confusion comes from."
<br><br>
"You see, Mr. Paine meant that it would be a week before my return, whereupon he would ask for my approval of his unorthodox methods. Having seen the merits of those methods," he added, his gaze firmly fixed at Charmaine's naked breasts to reinforce the message of just what merits he had seen, "I have confirmed his opinion. Based on the skills you demonstrated earlier today, this has done you much good. As for the duration of this punishment, he has said nothing. I am afraid we'll need to await his return until he makes his intention clear."
<br><br>
Charmaine was shattered.
<br><br>
"But... it was said he will be gone for a couple of weeks?"
<br><br>
"Hopefully, Charmaine, hopefully. We can but hope. However, he fully appraised me of the business he has to deal with, and I think his assessment of two weeks was overly optimistic. It could well be a month until he returns. Or two," he added ominously.
<br><br>
Her heart sank further. Overcoming her fear under the oppressive authority of Sir Richard's gaze, Charmaine managed one last entreaty.
<br><br>
"Please, sir, I can't remain like this indefinitely. Can't you end the punishment yourself?"
<br><br>
"My dear girl... You know I have commanded one of her Majesty's regiments. In that position, it would have been utterly inappropriate for me to go over the head of one my subordinates and countermand their orders. As lord of the manor, I cannot do this in my own household either."
<br><br>
Her eyes turned imploringly to the substitute butler.
<br><br>
"And I don't think Mr. Williams will want to start his term by overriding the principal in his role," Sir Richard concluded noticing her gaze, the steel in his voice prompting the latter to nod meekly in agreement.
<br><br>
"Understood, sir," Charmaine murmured, her heart sinking even deeper as she realized her fate was sealed for however long it took for Mr. Paine to return.
<br><br>
She felt a surge of disappointment well up inside her, the reality of her predicament suddenly hitting her full force. Not only did she have to contend with working naked for an unknown period, but she was also going to be subjected to Mr. Williams' harsh treatment, who she already knew, would make her suffer in equal measure to the butler's cruelty.
<br><br>
Sir Richard had also taken a new and much more personal role in her life now. Her future had never looked bleaker.
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 13 [Charmaine Learns How to Be a (Naked) Chambermaid] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
The next week saw Charmaine continuing her tasks in the manor while trying to come to terms with her new reality. The servants had already adapted to the constant presence of a beautiful naked girl in their midst, her generous breasts and her cleanly shaven intimate parts on full display as she went about with her daily routine.
<br><br>
At first, they had been shocked and discomfited by her state, but slowly they had grown accustomed to seeing her like this. For most of them, it became simply part of their everyday lives. Some of the older servants joked among themselves about how young Charmaine was, and wondered if this was how all young maids were these days.
<br><br>
The young footman James, however, was a different matter altogether. James' interest in Charmaine had begun with her initial arrival in the house. He had been struck by her beauty and innocence, watching her struggle to adapt to her new environment. He had been impressed by her determination and by the bravery she displayed in handling herself in such difficult circumstances.
<br><br>
Her body seemed to fill him with a strange mix of lust and protectiveness. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't seem to stop himself from stealing glances at her whether she was aware of him looking at her or not.
<br><br>
Her state of constant nudity left nothing to the imagination, but his imagination ran wild nevertheless. In his dreams and daydreams, he often envisioned touching her smooth skin, kissing her soft lips, and exploring the gentle folds of her flesh. The memory of holding her, of sliding his hands on her bare skin, burned in him and kindled a desire for much more.
<br><br>
As Charmaine worked alongside James throughout the week, his feelings grew stronger.
<br><br>
It was both fascinating and frustrating to watch her go about her tasks completely nude. At times, he felt as though he might burst with the desire to touch her, but he held himself back. He didn't want to risk damaging her fragile trust in him or jeopardize his position in the household. Still, the temptation was strong.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Charmaine was struggling to adjust to her new situation. The constant exposure left her feeling vulnerable and uneasy.
<br><br>
Yet, she couldn't deny the sense of freedom she experienced too; the feeling of her body being completely visible to others somehow liberated her from any lingering shame. It was ironic, considering her past, and her strict upbringing.
<br><br>
James' restraint was growing increasingly difficult to maintain. Each day, the temptation to touch her grew stronger.
<br><br>
As they worked together, he showed her the intricacies of his duties. He was proud of his role as the valet, and delighted in teaching her.
<br><br>
Though he was careful not to touch her directly, his mere proximity seemed to send waves of desire coursing through her body.
<br><br>
Charmaine, for her part, learned quickly. Her diligence and attentiveness won her respect amongst the other staff members. She was grateful for the opportunity to learn the responsibilities of the role, hoping it would lead to better things in her future.
<br><br>
The days passed, and the tension between Charmaine and James grew increasingly palpable. She found herself increasingly putting herself in positions that exposed her body further, almost tauntingly, unconsciously seeking attention.
<br><br>
James also became aware that Charmaine seemed to await for his presence before starting the tasks that would put her in various compromising positions - on her hands and knees scrubbing the floors, bent over dusting a low shelf, or prone on the floor boards to reach beneath a piece of furniture.
<br><br>
Each time, she deliberately positioned herself so that he could see every inch of her bare skin.
<br><br>
Their interactions grew more charged and filled with sexual tension. James became bolder with his hands, whenever she needed his help keeping her balance. He would stand behind her when she was perched high on a stool, his hands firmly on her waist to steady her, the heat of his palms sending warmth and a rush of desire coursing through her. He would then playfully support her buttocks while she was climbing down, feeling the movement of her strong muscles under her smooth bare skin.
<br><br>
Charmaine felt as though she were balancing on the edge of a cliff, wanting to fall into the abyss of desire but fearful of the consequences.
<br><br>
Sir Richard did not interrupt their routine, and observed the interactions with keen interest when he was present.
<br><br>
Sensing the mounting tension between them, he decided to test the limits of Charmaine's newfound vulnerability. One evening, after dinner, he instructed James to take Charmaine to the master bedroom to retrieve a specific book for him. He made sure that he left them alone in the room together, knowing the implications of their closeness in that space.
<br><br>
James led Charmaine through the corridors, his heart pounding with excitement and trepidation. Charmaine followed quietly, her steps becoming increasingly erratic due to the combination of fear and arousal.
<br><br>
They reached the door to the master bedroom, and James hesitated momentarily, glancing at Charmaine. The air was thick with anticipation, and Charmaine's breath caught in her throat. James grasped the handle, pushed open the door, and ushered her in, his hand brushing against her side as he guided her towards the center of the room.
<br><br>
The massive four-poster bed dominated the room, its luxurious curtains drawn aside, revealing the opulent silk sheets.
<br><br>
Charmaine's gaze swept across the decadent chamber, her heart pounding in her chest. This was the epitome of wealth and power – and yet, in this moment, she stood stark naked amidst its splendor.
<br><br>
James led her to the bookcase near the fireplace, his eyes unable to escape her enticing figure. She sensed his burning desires and knew that this was no accident – Sir Richard had wanted them to be alone in this room, and with his permission, there was little stopping them from giving in to their mutual passion.
<br><br>
Charmaine's cheeks flushed red with embarrassment and fear, her hands trembling slightly as she searched for the right book. She felt as though she were walking on eggshells, terrified of making a mistake that would be impossible to undo.
<br><br>
James, despite his restraint thus far, struggled to contain his emotions. The sight of Charmaine standing before him, naked and trembling, filled him with a mixture of lust and protectiveness.
<br><br>
He was achingly close to giving in to his desires, but he remained steadfast, refusing to cross the line. With a deep breath, he managed to regain control of his emotions.
<br><br>
"I believe it is this one here," Charmaine told James, her voice wavering slightly. She pulled out a leather-bound volume from the shelf, its embossed gold lettering catching the light from the nearby candelabra. James took it from her with an unsteady hand.
<br><br>
His gaze drifted back to Charmaine, her innocent eyes wide with apprehension, her slender fingers nervously playing with the loose strands of her hair. She was so exposed, yet so defiant, so vulnerable yet so resilient. It was a heady mix of contradictions that drove him mad.
<br><br>
"We should return to the library now," James finally broke the silence, attempting to regain some semblance of composure. "Sir Richard expects us."
<br><br>
He extended his arm towards the door, gesturing for Charmaine to precede him.
<br><br>
Charmaine swallowed hard, her heart pounding with anxiety. She knew that the situation was becoming more precarious by the minute. But, with no other choice, she obediently moved towards the exit, her bare feet moving across the polished wooden floorboards.
<br><br>
Outside the room, James closed the door behind them and hurriedly escorted Charmaine back to the library.
<br><br>
He felt conflicted – his desire for her consumed him, yet he resisted the urge to act upon it. As they walked, his eyes darted to her again and again, taking in her beauty with renewed appreciation.
<br><br>
Charmaine followed in silence, her mind racing with thoughts of what had transpired. The intensity of the situation left her feeling shaken and uncertain. As they neared the library, she tried to focus on the task at hand, all the while grappling with the overwhelming mix of emotions coursing through her body.
<br><br>
Sir Richard raised his eyebrows when they returned, but did not question them.
<br><br>
He had become accustomed to observing Charmaine at her work, her every move, her expressions and reactions. He watched her carefully, but did not interfere, and did not issue any orders that he would not have ordered a clothed maid to do. It seemed that he enjoyed watching her, but not in a overly lewd manner. No, it was a different sort of enjoyment. It was the pleasure of having complete power over another human being.
<br><br>
Charmaine was both grateful for his restraint, and resentful towards the fact that yet he kept her constantly naked, exposed not only to his view but to everyone in the household too.
<br><br>
She often thought about how different her life would have been if she hadn't gotten involved with this influential family.
<br><br>
In her quiet moments, Charmaine would sometimes fantasize about the day when she would finally get out of this predicament. When she could once again cover herself, dress appropriately, and find a place where she could truly call home.
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 14 [A Naked Trip to London] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
"Prepare my luggage for a week in London," Sir Richard surprised them one morning. "And yours, too, James," he added.
<br><br>
"Charmaine, you have nothing to pack, you will come as you are."
<br><br>
Sir Richard's words left Charmaine stunned. A trip to London, in this state, for an entire week? It was incomprehensible to her.
<br><br>
She had always wanted to go to London, but not like this. To think that she would be traveling dressed only in her bare skin, to the very heart of the Empire?
<br><br>
"But, Sir...," she didn't even know what to say. How could she possibly face the city of London, its bustling streets and the people, all the while remaining naked? It seemed a nightmare come true. It also seemed quite impossible.
<br><br>
Sir Richard, seeing her confusion, responded nonchalantly, "Why not? You have adapted well to your role here, and I am certain you will do just fine in London. And besides, it will be interesting to observe the reactions of those around you. You may even learn something about yourself."
<br><br>
Charmaine bit her lip, feeling cornered. There was no way out of this. Her life as a housemaid was a constant struggle to maintain her dignity and modesty, but now she was faced with an entirely new challenge - being completely exposed on the grand stage of London.
<br><br>
The thought of it made her feel faint.
<br><br>
Sir Richard reveled in her turmoil, deliberately leaving her with the impression that she would be required to walk the streets of the capital naked. For all his importance as a Peer of the Realm - or precisely because of it - he knew he could not afford to create such a scandal. However, he liked seeing her squirm and could not resist teasing her further. He mentioned that Charmaine could accompany him to a prestigious social event he was invited to, held at the residence of Lord Whitfield.
<br><br>
"It will give you a chance to have a glimpse of London society up close, perhaps learn a thing or two," he commented, his voice carrying a hint of amusement. "However, remember, you will remain naked for the duration of our stay."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart raced with trepidation as she assisted James with the preparation of the luggage.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but notice her trembling hands and the unease etched on her face. James felt a mix of sympathy and excitement, both for Charmaine and himself. He was fairly sure that Sir Richard would not expose her to the streets of London in this state, but he dared not say anything about his thoughts to her.
<br><br>
As they finished packing, Charmaine found herself examining her reflection in the mirror, trying to muster up courage for the unknown challenges awaiting her in London. Her nakedness made her feel incredibly vulnerable, and the prospect of navigating a foreign city under these circumstances filled her with dread.
<br><br>
"What should I expect in London?" she asked James, trying to gather information about the city and its people.
<br><br>
James considered her question for a moment, searching for the appropriate response. "London can be a busy and crowded place, especially during the season."
<br><br>
James began hesitantly, considering the potential implications of his words. "It could also be dangerous, especially for a young woman like you, without any protection."
<br><br>
When the carriage was ready, all the household staff gathered outside to see them off. They exchanged glances, some with disapproval, others with curiosity. The footman James noticed their whispers and frowns, which only heightened his determination to protect Charmaine throughout their journey.
<br><br>
He looked quite splendid in his house livery as he took his customary place on the sideboard of the carriage. Charmaine, being a woman and being entirely naked, received the unusual privilege of traveling inside the carriage with Sir Richard. The sun was already high, casting a golden hue over the countryside, as the horse-drawn carriage trundled along the dusty road.
<br><br>
Charmaine wrapped her arms around herself tightly, trying to provide some semblance of modesty against the chilly air. She was glad that she wasn't exposed to the harsh wind that blew through the open windows of the carriage. But still, she felt self-conscious, unable to forget that she was not wearing any clothes.
<br><br>
Sir Richard seemed engrossed in a book, but cast the occasional long glance in the direction of her exposed breasts or further down, towards her bare legs.
<br><br>
Charmaine shifted uncomfortably, wishing she could find a way to cover herself properly. Charmaine shivered as the cold air seeped into the carriage. She wished fervently for a warm blanket to wrap around herself, but knew she wouldn't receive one.
<br><br>
"You seem rather uncomfortable, my dear," said Sir Richard.
<br><br>
His voice betrayed no emotion, but Charmaine could sense a trace of amusement in his tone. She shifted nervously, struggling to meet his gaze.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir," she replied quietly, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "I apologize for the inconvenience."
<br><br>
Sir Richard shook his head slightly, looking away from her briefly before turning back. "There's no need to apologize," he said, his voice now tinged with a hint of sympathy.
<br><br>
"After all, it is not your fault. You will be able to warm shortly, as we stop at my favorite pub for lunch."
<br><br>
Charmaine was shaken by his words. She knew protesting would be pointless. He would be exposing her in front of strangers, putting her through yet another humiliating experience. Unable to speak, she nodded her head.
<br><br>
When the coach finally stopped in the yard of an old inn, Sir Richard had a quiet conversation with James through the open window. James set off in the direction of the inn, while his master continued reading his book in the carriage.
<br><br>
After a while, the footman returned. "All is arranged, Sir," he said, opening the door for the gentleman to step out. Sir Richard closed the book, putting it aside, and got off the carriage.
<br><br>
James gently reached out to offer his hand to Charmaine. With kindness in his eyes, he helped her climb down the step. Then, taking her delicate hand in his own, he led her toward the entrance of the pub.
<br><br>
Despite her misgivings, Charmaine had to admit that her surroundings were beautiful. The sunlight gleamed off the stone and wooden exterior of the building, casting a warm, inviting glow on the establishment.
<br><br>
Inside, the pub was cozy and rustic, with low ceilings and dim lighting. The smell of ale and smoke wafted through the air, creating a welcoming atmosphere despite the chill outside.
<br><br>
James led Charmaine through the door. The chatter of patrons and clinking glasses filling the room died down as she stood at the entrance in her full glory.
<br><br>
The room fell silent, and all eyes turned to the unexpected spectacle before them. It was as though time itself paused, waiting for the world to react to this strange tableau. Charmaine's pale skin was accentuated by the sun light filtering in through the dusty windows, her hair tousled by the wind outside. She felt acutely aware of her own vulnerability as she was exposed to the curious gazes of the all-male patrons of the pub. Each man's attention seemed focused solely on her, making her feel even more uneasy than before.
<br><br>
Amidst the shocked silence, the owner of the tavern approached them, stepping forward to greet Sir Richard. As he did so, his eyes fell upon Charmaine, causing his jaw to drop slightly. He quickly regained his composure, bowing deeply before the nobleman.
<br><br>
"Welcome, my lord!" he exclaimed. "Your usual table is prepared. Please follow me," the innkeeper said, gesturing towards a private area where he normally hosted distinguished guests.
<br><br>
James and Charmaine followed him and Sir Richard through a narrow passageway and into a cozy room filled with antique furniture.
<br><br>
"Excellent," Sir Richard declared, taking a seat. "Charmaine will help you with the lunch. She and James can then have their lunch in the common room."
<br><br>
The innkeeper was flustered by the help of a young, pretty, and very naked woman. Despite his discomfort, he nodded and guided Charmaine to a small kitchen behind the main room.
<br><br>
Charmaine began helping the cook prepare lunch. She worked diligently, doing her best to ignore the stares and whispers of the other kitchen staff. Their hot gazes made her feel even more vulnerable than before.
<br><br>
As each dish was ready, Charmaine carried them one by one through the common area to the private room in the back.
<br><br>
She could feel the eyes of the patrons burning into her flesh, their whispers and murmurs becoming more pronounced as she went. Finally, Sir Richard's lunch was served and she could return to the common room with James. He walked beside her, occasionally glancing at her in concern, while the patrons watched them with fascination.
<br><br>
Charmaine sat down, feeling more embarrassed than ever. This was not how she had imagined her first visit to London to be. Meanwhile, Sir Richard was enjoying his meal in the privacy of the separate room.
<br><br>
"His Lordship is very important here," James explained over lunch. "Nobody dares cross his will."
<br><br>
"He told me to have a word with the proprietor, who then had a word with the patrons. No word of this will ever get out."
<br><br>
Charmaine felt no better after this reassurance.
<br><br>
She silently thanked James for his support and tried to ignore the men's leering looks, focusing instead on the simple fare laid out before her. The food, although basic, was much appreciated, having spent most of the day in the carriage.
<br><br>
Throughout lunch, Charmaine observed the behavior of the patrons. Some whispered among themselves, while others simply stared at her, their expressions varying from surprise to disdain.
<br><br>
In spite of their different reactions, they all appeared to share a single motive – the desire to ogle the helpless maid. Charmaine could hardly bear the scrutiny any longer. Tears of frustration and shame welled up in her eyes, threatening to spill over.
<br><br>
Feeling utterly powerless, she was relieved when the lunch came to an end.
<br><br>
Sir Richard left a large gold coin on the counter as payment, giving the proprietor a nod before leaving. James escorted Charmaine back to the carriage, where she hurriedly entered the relative privacy of its compartment. Her heart raced with fear and anxiety as she thought about what lay ahead in London.
<br><br>
Upon arriving at Sir Richard's townhouse, Charmaine faced an entirely new challenge.
<br><br>
From the moment she entered the grand house, she felt the hostility of the servants towards her. As they took her to her room, she could hear the mutterings of disapproval from those passing by. Every pair of eyes that met hers seemed to convey their scornful judgment. She reeled with the unfairness of it - it was not by her own choice that she was constantly naked.
<br><br>
Charmaine's new quarters were located deep within the house, far removed from the main areas of activity. It was a stark contrast to the spacious, sunlit rooms in the master's wing where she had to perform her duties.
<br><br>
Her new chamber, hidden away in the darker corners of the house, held nothing but a small bed, a rickety chair, and a dresser. The floorboards creaked with every step she took, adding to her growing sense of isolation.
<br><br>
Even though she was determined to remain strong, she couldn't help but feel defeated as she lay down on her cold, hard mattress that night. Closing her eyes, she wondered if things would ever change for her. Would she ever find comfort and happiness in this strange new life?
<br><br>
These questions echoed through Charmaine's troubled mind as she drifted off to sleep. In the depths of the night, she was awakened by a soft knock on her door. Fearing it might be some ill-intentioned prankster, she hesitated before opening it. To her relief, it was James standing there, holding a candle.
<br><br>
"I wanted to check on you," he said with genuine concern. "Are you alright?"
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded gratefully, admitting her worries and apprehensions.
<br><br>
"I am not quite used to this life," she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. "It feels as though I'm constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing what to expect."
<br><br>
James nodded in understanding. "I know it's been difficult for you. But don't let them get to you," he said firmly.
<br><br>
"This is just a temporary phase, and soon enough, you'll adapt to your new life. Give it time, and remember that I'm here to help you whenever you need me."
<br><br>
Charmaine was grateful for his words of encouragement. "Thank you, James," she replied, her voice trembling slightly. "I appreciate your help."
<br><br>
With a small smile, James offered his hand. "Don't mention it. Just consider us friends in these trying times."
<br><br>
Charmaine grasped his hand tightly, drawing strength from his unwavering support.
<br><br>
"Thank you, James," she repeated, her voice stronger now. "I appreciate your help."
<br><br>
James smiled warmly, squeezing her hand gently. "Consider us friends in these trying times." With that, he released her hand and retreated back to his quarters.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 15 [Charmaine Questions Her Naked Fate] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
Charmaine's days passed by in a blur of cleaning, serving Sir Richard's breakfasts - he had lunch and dinner elsewhere - and constant exposure to the prying eyes of the household staff.
<br><br>
She had been relieved to realize that Sir Richard had no real intention of displaying her outside of his town house. In London, he did not have the power to intimidate all on-lookers into silence.
<br><br>
Still, the servants' hostile treatment weighed heavily on her spirit. The footman James, however, remained a constant source of solace. They spent much time in friendly conversation while working together or during breaks. This provided her with much-needed distraction from the constant scrutiny and judgments cast upon her by the rest of the staff.
<br><br>
During these moments, Charmaine found herself appreciating the company of someone who didn't seem to judge her based on her nudity.
<br><br>
James had many stories of his time "under the colors", in the regiment commanded by Sir Richard. It was apparent that he also knew many stories of Sir Richard himself, but would no share any of them with Charmaine.
<br><br>
"He is a right bastard and no mistake," was the only thing he would say. "Nobody in his right mind would try to defy him."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart skipped a beat at the thought of confronting Sir Richard. Despite her desperation for answers, she knew that doing so would bring grave consequences. Still, she needed answers about her future.
<br><br>
One late evening she mustered up the courage to talk to him directly, after she had served him his sherry. Summoning all her bravery, she cautiously broght up the subject, her cheeks flushed with nervous anticipation.
<br><br>
"Excuse me, sir," she began, trying to keep her voice steady. "I... I have something I would like to discuss with you."
<br><br>
Sir Richard looked up, his expression betraying a mix of curiosity and annoyance.
<br><br>
"What is it, girl?" he asked sharply.
<br><br>
Charmaine took a deep breath, trying to gather her courage. "I would like to know what my future holds here, sir," she ventured tentatively. "When will I be able to get my uniform back?"
<br><br>
"You know, girl, we already discussed this," he answered coolly.
<br><br>
Charmaine winced at his tone, but persisted.
<br><br>
"I understand, sir, but I cannot continue in this manner...," her voice trailed off as she waited for his response. Silence filled the room, heavy with the weight of her question. Finally, Sir Richard spoke, his tone cold and uncompromising.
<br><br>
"You cannot or you will not, girl? You will serve me in any manner my butler decides, until further notice, just as you agreed upon signing the contract."
<br><br>
"You are free to quit at any time, and leave this house just as you are," he added with a hint of malice which reminded her of James, who had called Sir Richard "a right bastard" whom it was never wise to defy.
<br><br>
Charmaine's face turned pale at his words. She knew that without references, she would never find another job and would likely end up destitute and homeless on the streets. And what would happen to a beautiful naked girl on the streets of the big city... it didn't bear thinking about.
<br><br>
Her hands shook uncontrollably as she poured Sir Richard his second sherry, her eyes welling with tears.
<br><br>
Ruthlessly, he continued to speak, his cruel words piercing her heart like daggers. "If I decide to be good to you, I might even provide you with references. I am aware of at least two discreet gentlemen's clubs which would love to have you entertain their members. Bare as you are now, of course."
<br><br>
Charmaine was crushed. She could hold her tears no more, feeling the pain and humiliation surge through her body like a tidal wave. Her emotions were a maelstrom of fear, despair, and rage. The idea of ending up as an object of debauchery in one of those clubs was her worst nightmare come true.
<br><br>
Inside, she was screaming at the unfairness of it all. Why should she suffer this indignity when she hadn't done anything wrong?
<br><br>
She quietly left the room, tears streaming down her cheeks. In the safety of her own room, she allowed herself to break down, letting out her anguish and frustration. It seemed that the cruel twist of fate had doomed her to a life of servitude and humiliation. The thought made her heart ache with a painful, raw emotion. She curled up into a ball on her bed, wrapping her arms around herself as if to protect herself from the world outside.
<br><br>
Sleep finally came, but it brought no comfort or escape from her nightmares. In her dreams, she was forced to parade naked through the streets, the jeering crowd baying for her flesh. She woke up with a start, drenched in sweat, her heart racing. The nightmares were becoming more frequent, feeding her growing anxiety and helplessness.
<br><br>
James noticed her state of agitation the next morning, and they shared a few more words of comfort.
<br><br>
Charmaine couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards him. His kindness was a rare commodity among the servants.
<br><br>
The day wore on, and Charmaine found herself engrossed in her chores, lost in thought about her predicament. She wished there was a way out of this tormenting existence. As she polished the silverware, her mind drifted to her past – the days before she ever set foot in Sir Richard's house. She recalled her dear dead mother's soft touch, the smell of their tiny hovel, and the hardships they faced daily. But compared to this, those struggles seemed almost trivial. If only she could return to those simpler times, she mused wistfully.
<br><br>
Yet, she knew that the reality of her life had changed forever. No matter how much she longed for it, her old life was gone, lost somewhere between her home village and the grand mansion.
<br><br>
Her thoughts turned once again to James, whose gentle presence seemed to offer some solace amidst the chaos of her new existence. He was one of the few people in the house who didn't treat her like an object to be used and discarded at whim. He seemed genuinely concerned for her wellbeing, and she cherished that small spark of humanity in this sea of indifference.
<br><br>
However, she knew better than to hope for anything more from him. After all, he was a servant, like her, bound by the same chains of servitude.
<br><br>
Charmaine was surprised at the happiness she felt when the lord informed them that they would be returning to the country estate the next day. It was not only that she hated the London house with its snobby staff. To her astonishment, she realized that she thought of the country manor as her home. The staff there, who had initially treated her state of nudity as an amusement, soon warmed up to her and started treating her as an equal, pretending not to notice her lack of clothing.
<br><br>
The travel by carriage was slow and peaceful, allowing Charmaine to take in the countryside's picturesque beauty. The sight of lush green fields and verdant woods calmed her frazzled nerves.
<br><br>
Upon arriving at the estate, she breathed a sigh of relief, grateful to be away from the oppressive confines of the city. She greeted her fellow servants, and they greeted her as part of their large family.
<br><br>
Her tiny room with only a bed an empty dresser in it felt like her only anchor to reality, her sanctuary. She wished to never have to leave the manor again.<br><br><br><br>
<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 16 [Charmaine's Naked Fate is Sealed] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
It had been several weeks since Charmaine returned to the country estate, and she had gradually grown accustomed to her new existence. She found a certain solace in her nudity, accepting it as a part of her life in the house. The servants had slowly begun to treat her as just another member of the household, ignoring her lack of clothing. Even though she still felt exposed, she had learned to move around confidently without clothes. She was grateful for the freedom granted to her by the country manor, where the staff respected her as an equal, and for the seclusion of the place which allowed for privacy from strangers.
<br><br>
As she went about her duties, cooking and cleaning alongside the other servants, Charmaine became more comfortable with her new circumstances. Where she had been tormented before by the petty mischief of the kitchen boys who sought new ways to expose her, she now found herself initiating such tasks herself. Just as she did before when she was alone with James, she now did the same with others. It was easier when there was a task to perform, rather than simply standing there while others ogled. Her initial timidity had vanished, replaced by a calm confidence.
<br><br>
She had grown somewhat accustomed to the attention that her nudity drew from everyone, and had now started to push her own limits, doing things that she would have never imagined herself doing earlier.
<br><br>
She found that she liked mopping the floors under the attentive gaze of the footmen, stretching up when washing the windows, serving the food naked, or merely walking around the estate gardens and chatting to the people she met. Her lithe nude body became a frequent and welcome sight everywhere.
<br><br>
The stables had become a favorite place for her, where she helped the stable hands in grooming and caring for the horses. Remembering her re-enactment of the tale of Lady Godiva, they were happy to start giving her riding lessons and she could soon be seen riding a horse bareback along the paths in the garden. As she trotted across the land, wind whipping through her hair, she felt free and liberated from the shackles of society's norms. The sun kissed her skin gently, the warmth spreading through her entire body. Her heart swelled with joy as she felt closer to nature than ever before.
<br><br>
The nude Charmaine on a horse, riding through the sprawling gardens of the estate was indeed a sight to behold, something that the male members of the household would never forget.
<br><br>
The maid explored all areas of the estate and volunteered even to help the elderly head gardener. The old man put her to work raking leaves and pruning shrubs. She teased him by bending to weed between the flowers in a playful manner, knowing full well what kind of view she presented to his eyes.
<br><br>
It was the season to pick apples and she climbed many an apple tree, balancing precariously on the branches to pluck ripe fruit. She felt an unfamiliar, overwhelming feeling when she looked down to the waiting men, their mouths open, their eyes glazed, unable to tear themselves for the unreal vision of Charmaine above them - naked, legs wide open to balance between two neighboring branches, one arm grabbing a branch for support and the other reaching forward for an apple, her hanging breasts straining against gravity.
<br><br>
Her face flushed crimson from the cold wind but also from embarrassment. She felt a mixture of shame and pride, vulnerable yet powerful, completely naked yet fully embracing her body. The experience was intoxicating, addictive, as she realized she could no longer turn back from this path that had been chosen for her.
<br><br>
In the house, she continued helping James in doing his duties, whether it was cleaning, polishing, dusting, or whatever was required. Charmaine spent much time alone with him in the master's wing of the house. As the unpleasant memories of the trip to London started to wear off, she returned to her former ways of teasing him, and he to his delicate but firm touches, and together they engaged in games that pushed the boundaries of decency and propriety.
<br><br>
Increasingly, the other servants saw James and Charmaine as an item, whispering behind their backs. Despite being conscious of their reputation, neither James nor Charmaine could resist these forbidden moments of intimacy, taking advantage of the solitude offered by the expansive mansion.
<br><br>
In her first week naked, James had tentatively kissed Charmaine but had gone no further. Now, he became bolder and she found herself responding eagerly.
<br><br>
His kisses explored all parts of her body, so conveniently laid all bare before him all the time.
<br><br>
Charmaine felt as if she was being claimed, owned, possessed, by this rough but gentle man. His lips, his tongue, his teeth all worked their magic upon her, sending waves of pleasure coursing through her veins. The feeling was unlike anything she had experienced before.
<br><br>
She now walked around the manor in a state of almost constant excitement, the thought of James and their encounters driving her mad with a desire which neither of them dared to fulfill. Their relationship had evolved beyond the boundaries of friendship, and Charmaine knew they had to find a way to quell the growing passion that threatened to consume them both.
<br><br>
Each evening, she tossed in her small bed for hours, her hands dreamily exploring her own body, imagining James' touch and yearning for the release they both desired but couldn't give to each other.
<br><br>
In the end, it was Sir Richard, of all people, who found a satisfactory resolution to their predicament.
<br><br>
One afternoon, he summoned Charmaine to the library.
<br><br>
She entered the room, nervous and expectant, not quite sure why she had been called. Sir Richard stood at the window, gazing out into the vast garden below. Turning to face her, he spoke softly, "Charmaine, I have some news for you."
<br><br>
He paused, letting the anticipation build up in her, as he carefully chose his words.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart raced, her palms sweaty with fear and excitement. "What is it, sir?" she asked, trying to sound composed.
<br><br>
Sir Richard smiled slightly, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "You remember Mr. Paine, yes?"
<br><br>
Charmaine nodded hesitantly, unsure what to make of the sudden mention of Mr. Paine. How could she not remember the man who sentenced her to this naked servitude? He had punished her to work bare naked - for a week, he said. But then he went away on an extended leave, and Sir Richard had decided to interpret his words differently. It meant only a week until Mr. Paine got a chance to discuss his methods with the lord of the manor, he had said. Sir Richard had confirmed the butler's methods, but the latter had departed before saying how long the punishment was supposed to last for.
<br><br>
Now, Sir Richard had said piously, he was just waiting for the return of the butler so he could supply that little technicality. In the meantime, Charmaine remained in the nude, working at various tasks in his household and learning to be his personal maid, assisting his valet James.
<br><br>
All of this flashed through Charmaine's mind in a storm of memories and emotions. She had been horrified by the initial prospect of working naked for a week. She had been devastated when this was extended with two more weeks, after which the butler was supposed to return. She had eagerly awaited his arrival and the possible return of her clothes.
<br><br>
Charmaine was now startled to realize that many weeks had passed, and recently she had not even thought of that possibility. What had happened to her?
<br><br>
Sir Richard broke the long silence of her reminiscence.
<br><br>
"I have been in correspondence with him. He was ready to return soon after his departure, but I told him not to hurry..."
<br><br>
The monstrosity of this statement left Charmaine speechless. The butler had started this all, but it was Sir Richard who had orchestrated the events after the first week which ensured that she could not get her clothes back all that time!
<br><br>
"I have now offered Mr. Paine a decent retirement, on one of my other properties. He has accepted, and will not be coming back."
<br><br>
Charmaine stared at him, unable to believe what she was hearing. This new development was entirely unexpected, but what did it signify? She struggled to formulate a response, her mind racing with questions and concerns.
<br><br>
Finally, she managed to ask, "But... what does this mean for me, sir?"
<br><br>
"It is immaterial, and is in fact not why I asked to see you, Charmaine," he replied dismissively. "There's a matter concerning your future at the manor."
<br><br>
His tone turned suddenly businesslike, a stark contrast to his previous casualness.
<br><br>
"I am fully aware of the situation between you and James. Your conduct, while perhaps understandable under the circumstances, has been far from discreet." He eyed her sternly, emphasizing his disapproval.
<br><br>
"A man in my position cannot afford to have a scandal under his roof. A young maid getting pregnant, out of wedlock, would cause quite a stir among my peers. How can I aspire to assume control of my political party if I show myself unable to even control my own household? You must be aware of the consequences," Sir Richard said, his voice now quite stern.
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart sank at his words. She hadn't considered the impact this could have on her life and future. "Yes, sir, I understand," she replied quietly.
<br><br>
"Luckily, the solution is quite simple," Sir Richard forged on. "I have had a word with James, and he would be more than happy to marry you, should you agree."
<br><br>
Charmaine's heart skipped a beat. Marriage? To James? She tried to hide her astonishment, although she knew that it wouldn't go unnoticed. After all, James was a man whom she had come to care deeply about, despite their turbulent relationship. The idea of becoming his wife was thrilling, yet terrifying at the same time.
<br><br>
"If you choose to accept his proposal, you two will have my blessing. I can even think of a vicar who can be prevailed upon to conduct the ceremony in your current state."
<br><br>
Charmaine froze when she imagined the vision - standing next to James in a church, under the approving gazes of the assembled staff, the vicar pronouncing them man and wife - James resplendent in his house livery, and she standing in front of the congregation in all her nude glory.
<br><br>
"I will help you both secure your future. As a start, you will get new living quarters matching your new circumstances, separate from the rest of the staff," announced Sir Richard, his voice betraying a surprising measure of generosity.
<br><br>
"I will also make your position as James's assistant and my personal maid permanent, with the commensurate increase of pay."
<br><br>
Charmaine could hardly believe her ears. A promotion to such a position, so soon after she joined the household?
<br><br>
She opened her mouth to respond, but Sir Richard raised a hand to interrupt her.
<br><br>
"There is one final detail," he added. "The question of your uniform."
<br><br>
Charmaine frowned, confused by his sudden shift in tone. "What do you mean, Sir?"
<br><br>
"Look at yourself in the mirror, Charmaine," Sir Richard unexpectedly demanded.
<br><br>
Charmaine stood in front of the large mirror and looked at her own reflection, turning around to explore it from all angles under the watchful gaze of of the lord of the manor, who inspected her just as thoroughly.
<br><br>
Her full breasts stood proudly, her nipples darkened and hard from the cool air. Her slender waist gave way to plump hips, rounded buttocks and long legs. Her eyes traveled downward, taking in the sight of her womanhood, exposed and unashamed below her cleanly shaven mound. Her blonde hair fell across her shoulders, framing her face as she observed her own reflection, her skin smooth and devoid of blemishes.
<br><br>
As she admired her figure, Sir Richard continued to speak. "In fact, it is you I have to thank, Charmaine, for helping me to find a resolution to your clothing dilemma."
<br><br>
She looked at him questioningly.
<br><br>
"It is something that you said, back when we were in London. You wanted to know when you could get your uniform back," Sir Richard continued, his eyes fixed on her.
<br><br>
"But, you see, it is not 'your' uniform, my dear. When I served Her Britannic Majesty, I wore her uniform with pride. Her uniform - not mine. Just in the same way, everyone serving me in my household wears my uniform, each with the uniform that best suits his or her function," Sir Richard explained, his gaze holding hers with intensity.
<br><br>
"You will be in a new, unique position now, being the female helper of a lord's valet, and the personal maid to your lord. Consequently, a new uniform has to be created for you."
<br><br>
Charmaine thought she knew where the lord's speech was going, but did not dare to interrupt.
<br><br>
"Have a good look at yourself in the mirror again, Charmaine, and behold your new uniform. Wear it with pride."
<br><br>
As Charmaine looked at herself once more, the cold draft from the open window brushed gently against her bare flesh, leaving tiny goosebumps in its wake. She shivered slightly and took a deep breath, feeling the cool air caress her naked body.
<br><br>
Sir Richard watched her closely, observing her reaction to his words. He waited patiently until she finally turned to him.
<br><br>
"What do you say, Charmaine?"
<br><br>
"Thank you, Sir," was the only answer she could whisper.
<br><br>

<div class="chap"><span style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">=== Chapter 17 [BONUS NEN DEO CO TIEU DE] ===</span></div><br><br><br><br>
Charmaine woke up early as usual and got ready for another day of work, this time her path was no longer made with apprehension or worry, she was willing, happy and excited about another day where she could walk around the mansion completely naked. Her conversation the day before with Sir Richard made her realize that her new situation was no longer an unpleasantness, on the contrary, clothes were no longer part of her plans. Now it was exciting for her to walk to the kitchen as she heard the voices of fully clothed people getting closer and closer.
<br><br>
That day, when she arrived in the kitchen, she complimented Mrs. Atkinson and Stanley, who, even after so long, still interrupted their work to take a quick peek at Charmaine's slender body, which now looked even more beautiful without the discomfort she had experienced in the first few days of its exposure.
<br><br>
Charmaine began her chores, preparing the place for breakfast, but not before teasing Stanley, who had now become her favorite toy.
<br><br>
“Stanley, please help me with the salt shaker, I don’t want to make a mess.”
<br><br>
She then positioned him with his back to the shelf, made him join his hands at waist height so that she could support her foot and stand taller. Charmaine grabbed his shoulders and pushed herself up to balance herself on Stanley's hands, who although she was trying hard not to give in, was enjoying having her face so close to a beautiful shaved pussy. Charmaine, still not satisfied, pretended not to find the salt shaker and a few times held Stanley's hair with the excuse that she needed to balance herself, pulling his face to brush against her vagina.
<br><br>
“I found it,” said Charmaine as she descended, turned her back and walked away, leaving Staley paralyzed by what had just happened. Charmaine started to make him more and more excited and then suddenly abandon him.
<br><br>
She then went to cover the table and did so carefully, bending down to move her hands towards the center of the table, she seemed to want to avoid at all costs the fabric from showing any folds, when in fact she was actually hypnotizing Stanley with her breasts. plenty hanging.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the footsteps of the other servants arriving for breakfast, Charmaine strategically positioned herself to be seen from the back as they arrived. And in fact it was a delight for everyone to be welcomed with that privileged view.
<br><br>
After the meal, Charmaine hurries to serve Sir Richard and, as previously learned, she positions herself against the wall, with her arms behind her and legs slightly apart, awaiting guidance, fully committed to her task. After a signal from Sir Richard, she begins to collect the cutlery and clean the table while he observes, fascinated, the grace, nakedness and beauty of his new personal maid.
<br><br>
Charmaine spends the rest of the day focused on her tasks, but before the end of the afternoon she has some free time left and decides to go to the stables where she meets James who welcomes her with a big hug. Still hugging James says:
<br><br>
“I’m looking forward to our wedding.”
<br><br>
“I can’t wait either,” Charmaine responds, beaming with happiness.
<br><br>
They look at each other while a strong growing desire takes over both of their minds. James then slides his hands down his back to his fiancée's buttocks and firmly squeezes them, forcing her bare breasts to rub against her clothes. Charmaine feels her face burn and her modesty disappear to the point where her lascivious desires are noticeable. They both come to their senses with the neighing of the horse James was looking after. Charmaine and James let go and a little awkwardly James asks if she wants to ride for a bit. She, as always, accepted without hesitation.
<br><br>
In addition to the overwhelming pleasure of riding a horse, feeling the wind run through your hair and naked body, there was also the fun game of touching that occurred while James helped Charmaine onto the horse. James held it closer and closer to Charmaine's crotch who was only afraid that he would notice how wet she got on these occasions. James watched her completely naked galloping with her full breasts that rose and fell deliciously, but not only was his future wife's nudity fascinating, but so was the admiration of the stable boys who, even after some time, still looked attentively at all of Charmaine's exposed details. James realized there that Charmaine's exposure to other people also excited him and made him admire her doubly.
<br><br>
Charmaine, rode freely, like she had never felt before, without shyness, without pressure, she was where she wanted to be, the way she wanted to be, doing what she liked to do and now discovering a new pleasure, that of riding naked without any restrictions or fear. All the servants loved seeing her go by without clothes, even the women began to admire the lightness and elegance of her movements.
<br><br>
After riding for a long time, Charmaine returns to the stable and with James' help gets off the horse. She surprises him with a quick kiss and runs to the mansion saying that she needs to prepare and serve Sir Richard's dinner. It was difficult for James and the other servants to decide which sight was the most exciting, after all, which is better, seeing Charmaine running with or without a horse?
<br><br>
As night fell, Charmaine felt anxious that tonight would be a little different, as this time she had announcements to make. It was at a certain point during dinner that she stood up, revealing her lower nudity again, and with the help of the clink of a spoon in a glass she drew everyone's attention to her brief speech:
<br><br>
“I ask everyone for a little attention, I need to announce something important.”
<br><br>
Charmaine waited for everyone to remain silent and look at her. Even though she had been naked for so long, she still felt all those eyes on her body, causing a mix of shivers and addictive satisfaction.
<br><br>
"Yesterday, after Sir Richard's approval, James and I were allowed to get married", Charmaine looked smiling at James, who responded with another smile.
<br><br>
Everyone at the table celebrated, congratulated and proposed a toast for the good news, but before continuing, Charmaine interrupted:
<br><br>
“Calm down, calm down, I have something more to tell you”, she paused and looked at the faces of everyone in that place.
<br><br>
“Sir Richard also removed my punishment.” This new announcement made the atmosphere in the room change completely, the open and smiling faces began to transform into looks of discouragement and disappointment, although some tried to hide it and others even tried to mumble some false message of congratulations.
<br><br>
Charmaine had gotten the answer she wanted, the reading she did on those people's faces made her sure of her naked destiny in that mansion. It was no longer just her simple wish, Sir Richard approved and the servants wanted it too. Now even more confident she continued:
<br><br>
“From now on I will no longer walk around the mansion without clothes because of the punishment I received in the past, now I will walk around naked because this will be my new outfit.”
<br><br>
Some looked at each other, others were confused, not knowing whether they should regret or be grateful due to the fear of upsetting Charmaine, after all, even though she seemed very comfortable with her nudity, she might still prefer to go back to clothes like the others. Upon realizing that her announcement had not been received with enthusiasm, Charmaine began to feel embarrassed for having been excited about her new outfit until James intervened:
<br><br>
“What we have to know is whether you are happy with your new outfit.”
<br><br>
Charmaine was rekindled and without thinking much she replied:
<br><br>
"Clear! I'm very happy to know that I won't need to wear any more clothes!”
<br><br>
What was noticed next were faces with eyes wide in surprise and smiles appearing on the servants' faces. Noticing how excited her response was, Charmaine continued in a calmer tone:
<br><br>
“Everyone knows that it wasn't easy for me at first, but after so much time exposing my body I realized that this isn't such a bad thing, on the contrary, now it's very pleasant not to have fabrics restricting my movements or preventing me from feeling the gentleness of the body. wind"
<br><br>
One of the servants stood up and started clapping his hands saying:
<br><br>
“Congratulations on your courage Charmaine, I believe everyone will agree with me that your nudity is very welcome…”, pausing and looking at James he concluded "With all respect".
<br><br>
James nodded and another servant stood up saying:
<br><br>
“As we received two big news today it is important that we celebrate!”
<br><br>
There was then an outbreak of hugs and words of congratulations. Amid all the euphoria, some suggested that Charmaine and James dance to celebrate their engagement to the improvised music that their colleagues started banging on the table and pans. Although a little shy, the couple started holding hands and making some clumsy movements, but little by little they got into the rhythm and James got closer, holding Charmaine's waist firmly, pulling her close and giving agility to the dance accompanied by the palms of their hands. other animators who formed a circle around them. Charmaine felt her nakedness with each touch of James, the movement of her breasts and the brush of her thighs, it was being another incredible experience that she would love to continue enjoying indefinitely.
<br><br>
“Excuse me James, will you allow me the honor of also dancing with the bride?” - said one of the servants who had approached the couple.
<br><br>
“Of course, you just can’t steal her from me,” James joked as he transferred Charmaine’s hand to his colleague’s like a true knight.
<br><br>
Although Charmaine loved being touched by James while they danced, she couldn't deny that having different hands touching her naked body made her enjoy the moment even more, it became even more intense when another and another also asked to dance with her. Charmaine passed from arm to arm until it was Stanley's turn, where she didn't let him pass without first disturbing him a little bringing his lips close to his ear, whispering:
<br><br>
“I'm so excited that I might even wet your clothes”, then she slowly pushed him away, did a twirl and went into the arms of another servant to dance happily.
<br><br>
James was watching everything from outside the circle, he was getting very excited seeing his future wife naked and dancing spontaneously around so many men. He watched with pleasure every movement she made and the touch of other men on her exposed skin.
<br><br>
That night was a party, as Charmaine never imagined it could be, she was living in a moment completely opposite to what she experienced in her first days in that place, but her mind was so full of joy and excitement that she no longer remembered those unpleasant moments, it was a new life, a new experience that she desperately wanted to savor, but everyone had their obligations, the time was already forcing them to return to their beds, it was necessary to rest for the next day and with Charmaine it was no different, but this time James the He accompanied her to her room and before letting her in, he gave her a kiss that was returned with equal intensity. James didn't hold back and grabbed Charmaine's buttock and with his other hand squeezed her breast.
<br><br>
“I want to be yours” – Charmaine moaned breathlessly.
<br><br>
James squeezed her tighter, getting closer to Charmaine's ear and said:
<br><br>
“We can’t run the risk of you getting pregnant before our wedding, but that doesn’t stop me from giving you pleasure.”
<br><br>
With that James slowly slid his fingers down Charmaine's belly and went against her smooth and wet vagina, there he began to finger in a generous and calm way to the delight of Charmaine who was already lost in desire. James began to kiss her neck and gently moved down to Charmaine's breasts, who was going crazy and about to scream, but he gagged her corner of lust and immersed himself in the finally explored senses of her body. It didn't take much longer for Charmaine to collapse into spasms. James observed that she had gotten there and held her firmly, took her in his arms, took her to the bed, kissed her forehead and turned away on his back, absorbing that scene of a beautiful, naked woman trembling on the bed.
<br><br>
That was a night they would never forget.<br><br><br><br>
