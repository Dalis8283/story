<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Heather worked as a shop assistant in a women’s boutique, and had been doing so for about six months before she was offered a better job in a rival shop. Her departure had not gone down well with the owner, Miss Grey, so she wasn’t sorry that this was her last day. Closing time eventually came around and she said farewell to the other three assistants before heading for Miss Grey’s office as she had been requested to do earlier. She knocked and entered to find Miss Grey sitting behind her desk sorting through some paperwork. Miss Grey was in her mid thirties, nearly six foot tall with long black hair, she wore today, as she always did one of her navy blue business suits. She was not easy to get on with and never socialized with her staff, in fact her first name was completely unknown to any of the staff including Heather who now stood rather nervously in front of the desk. She was wearing the uniform provided for the shop staff which was quite a neat affair consisting of a matching navy blue jacket and thigh length skirt with black stockings and black high heeled shoes; a white blouse finished it off.. Miss Grey always had an air of authority about her and today was no exception as she looked up at the blonde 23 year old who uncomfortably avoided her gaze.
<br><br>
"Right," she began. "I’ve got a few forms for you to sign and then there are a couple of other matters to sort out before you leave, Heather."
<br><br>
"OK," Heather replied and she spent the next few minutes signing her name on various bits of paper as directed by Miss Grey. Once she had finished Miss Grey collected the papers together and put them in a drawer before once again addressing Heather.
<br><br>
" That’s the paperwork done which just leaves two other matters to deal with, the first being your uniform, we’ll need it back of course."
<br><br>
" No problem," Heather told her. "I’ll drop it in sometime next week, if that’s alright?"
<br><br>
Miss Grey was silent for a moment before she replied.
<br><br>
"I’m afraid it’s not, you see the last three people who have left all said the same thing but I’m still waiting for their uniforms."
<br><br>
"Oh but I’ll return it," Heather assured her.
<br><br>
Miss Grey looked thoughtful for a moment but then sighed and said, "No, I’m sorry, you’ll have to leave it now, I can’t afford to lose another one."
<br><br>
"But I’ve nothing else with me," Heather pleaded, "not even a coat."
<br><br>
"I can’t help that, Heather. I really must have the uniform before you leave."
<br><br>
Heather continued to plead with Miss Grey but deep down she knew it was a hopeless cause, Miss Grey was well known for not changing her mind and clearly she was doing this to get her own back on Heather. She eventually fell silent as her pleas were obviously falling on deaf ears and just stood there staring at her feet. Miss Grey finally broke the silence saying, in a icy tone, "I haven’t got all night Heather, the uniform please."
<br><br>
Fighting back the tears Heather began to slowly remove her jacket not really believing that this was happening to her. She remembered to take her keys out of the jacket pocket as she placed it on Miss Grey’s desk. She then undid the belt on her skirt before reaching behind her to unbutton and then unzip her skirt. She paused her and looked a Miss Grey, but the shop owner was busy, or a least appeared to be, looking through some invoices. Heather dejectedly let her skirt slide slowly to the floor, stepped out of it and then picking it up put on top of her jacket on the desk. The air felt cool on the bare flesh at the top of her thighs between where her hold up stockings finished and her rather brief white knickers began. Heather struggled with the buttons on her blouse as by now her hands were trembling and she was having difficulty controlling her fingers. The buttons on her cuffs caused the most trouble but eventually she succeeded and removed her blouse to reveal her 38C breasts which her white lacy half cup bra struggled to hold in place. She dropped the blouse on top of the rest of her uniform and stood back from the desk but before she could say anything Miss Grey, without looking up, curtly said, "The shoes are part of the uniform as well."
<br><br>
Suddenly Heather seethed with rage at the way Miss Grey was treating her and she wrenched the shoes from her feet and slammed them down on the desk.
<br><br>
"There you are," she hissed through clenched teeth.
<br><br>
Miss Grey looked up at her with a faint trace of amusement on her face before adding, "The stockings belong to this business as well." And then picked up her pen and began to write. Heather now red in the face could hardly control her anger as she virtually ripped the stockings from her legs and literally threw them at Miss Grey where they landed on the desk just in front of her. Miss Grey, with a look of distaste, carefully picked up one of the stockings with the end of her pen and deposited it in the rubbish bin. She then repeated the exercise with the other stocking before carrying on writing.
<br><br>
Heather stood in front of the desk in just her bra and knickers, her feeling of rage rapidly subsiding to be replaced by one of great anxiety.
<br><br>
"How was she going to get home," she thought desperately to herself, at least her car was in the underground car park below the shop. She felt a wave of panic sweep over her as she realized her predicament.
<br><br>
Her thoughts were then interrupted as Miss Grey put down her pen and said, "Thank you for the uniform, Heather, that just leaves one final matter."
<br><br>
"What’s that?" Heather spat out determined to put on a show of defiance despite her true feelings.
<br><br>
"The matter of the money that I lent you out of the petty cash," Miss Grey informed her.
<br><br>
"Well, I haven’t got any money, so you’ll have to wait, won’t you?" Heather replied coldly.
<br><br>
"I’d like to," Miss Grey continued, "but as I said earlier I have no guarantee that you will come back so perhaps you’d better leave something as security. Just for my peace of mind."
<br><br>
"But I don’t have anything," protested Heather. " I promise I’ll come back and pay you."
<br><br>
"I see you don’t even have a watch, " Miss Grey went on, "so you’ll have to leave something else instead."
<br><br>
"Like what?" Heather retorted.
<br><br>
"I’m afraid there is nothing else for it, you’ll have to leave your bra and knickers, they should more than cover the outstanding amount."
<br><br>
Heather was panic stricken. Surely Miss Grey wasn’t going to send her home without a stitch.
<br><br>
"Please, Miss Grey," she begged, " take my bra and knickers and I’ll be left with nothing."
<br><br>
"I’m very sorry, Heather, but I see no alternative. When you come back with the money, I’ll be happy to return them to you."
<br><br>
"Please, No!" Heather pleaded, "Don’t..."
<br><br>
Miss Grey said nothing but looked straight at Heather who could tell by the expression on her face that further argument was futile. So with tears welling up in her eyes she reached behind herself and unclipped her bra. Her breasts swung free as she slipped her arms very slowly out of the straps and put the white lace garment on the desk. She then hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her knickers and extremely slowly slid them down to her knees where she let them go to fall to the floor by themselves. Bending down she felt very vulnerable and put her arm across her naked breasts as she reached to pick up her knickers. These she put on top of her bra and then stood back, still covering her breasts, to await Miss Grey’s next move. Before Heather had much time to think about her predicament Miss Grey put down her pen and addressed her.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Heather, I’m sure you will be aware that I will be sorry to see you go and I wish you well in your new job." Heather couldn’t believe it, Miss Grey was talking to her as if nothing was amiss: yet she had jut made one of her staff strip naked in front of her. Heather could barely comprehend it as Miss Grey continued.
<br><br>
"Er, in view of your present situation, I’ll let you out of the fire exit directly into the car park. I believe your car is parked there."
<br><br>
"Yes," was all Heather could manage to whisper in reply not believing that this could be happening to her.
<br><br>
"In that case," Miss Grey went on, "as we’ve nothing else to do here I’ll take you down to the fire exit and bid you farewell."
<br><br>
Heather thought briefly about begging Miss Grey for her clothes but she knew that it would be a waste of time so instead she remained silent as her former boss came round from behind her desk, picking up Heather’s keys as she did so and headed for the office door. She opened it and walked out into the shop, Heather followed. As they walked through the store Heather looked at Miss Grey’s skirt swishing on her legs and wished she could feel a skirt doing the same on her own legs. In fact at that moment she would have settled for the feeling of any sort of clothing upon any part of her body. She felt strange as she followed Miss Grey, shoes clicking on the hard floor. In contrast Heather padded along silently behind with the floor feeling cold on the soles of her feet. Not that she really noticed as her thoughts had now turned to what would happen when she left the store. They eventually arrived at the fire exit and to Heather’s amazement Miss Grey turned and smiling held out her hand, "Well goodbye and good luck."
<br><br>
Heather with her mind in a turmoil found herself shaking the proffered hand and actually saying "Thank you."
<br><br>
Miss Grey then turned and pushed open the fire exit door. Heather felt herself involuntarily taking a step backwards as Miss Grey took a quick look around the car park before turning to Heather and saying, "All clear, off you go."
<br><br>
Heather took a deep breath and stepped through the door. To her horror she saw that there were still a few people around but as she turned to go back into the shop the fire door clanged shut behind her. She was well and truly on her own. Quickly she crouched behind a parked car and then carefully peered over it to see if she had been spotted. She hadn’t and after a good look round she set off towards her car in a crouching sort of run. As it was evening there were not many cars left and quite often she had to break from cover and make a dash in the open. Her progress was further hindered by being barefoot and not able to run very fast. So with several detours and one or two heartstopping moments when she was nearly spotted it took her nearly fifteen minutes to negotiate the car park. Finally she reached her car and still crouching she unlocked the door and thankfully slid inside. She had a quick look in the back but there was absolutely nothing to cover her nakedness.
<br><br>
"Oh well," she thought to herself, "It's dark outside and nobody will see me."
<br><br>
It was then she noticed the little green light on the dashboard.
<br><br>
"Damn I must have left the lights on this morning," she said out loud to herself.
<br><br>
About two seconds later a terrible thought hit her as she desperately jammed the key into the ignition and turned it. The engine did not even turn over, the battery was completely flat……………<br><br><br><br></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">
"Oh no," Heather wailed on the edge of panic. She was in a desperate situation and knew it, completely naked miles from home with a car that wouldn’t start. Her eyes glazed over and she slumped forward in defeat until her forehead was resting on the steering wheel. She racked her brains to see if she could think of a way out of her predicament but nothing came to mind. In a last desperate act she suddenly sat bolt upright and tried the ignition again but it was a futile gesture, there was no way the engine was going to start so she slowly leant back in her seat and began to wallow in self pity. For several minutes she sat there motionless staring into space until she was suddenly startled by a tap on the side window.
<br><br>
"Oh," she cried in fright and instinctively covered herself with her hands. Looking round she saw that Miss Grey was standing beside the car. A feeling of relief that it was not a stranger, passed briefly over her , but was rapidly replaced by one of extreme trepidation, this was, after all, the woman who had made her strip naked in the first place. Miss Grey indicated for her to wind down the window which Heather duly did.
<br><br>
"Having trouble?" Miss Grey enquired with a slight smirk on her face. "I thought you’d be long gone by now."
<br><br>
"My car won’t start," Heather explained, the despair evident in her voice.
<br><br>
"Oh dear, that’s unfortunate."
<br><br>
Miss Grey replied and was turning to leave when she was stopped by Heather saying, "Please….. please can I have my clothes back."
<br><br>
" The uniform belonged to me, remember?" Miss Grey responded, "and I’ll return your underwear when you pay me the money you owe."
<br><br>
"Please," Heather begged, "you can’t leave me stranded here naked."
<br><br>
"I could if I wanted," Miss Grey replied matter of factly.
<br><br>
"You wouldn’t," Heather gasped not believing what she was hearing.
<br><br>
Miss Grey stared intently at Heather for several seconds before breaking into a thin smile and saying, "No….. I suppose not."
<br><br>
"Thank you" Heather breathed with relief, "Where are my clothes?"
<br><br>
"They’re still in my office and I’m not going back for them," Miss Grey informed her and as Heather looked aghast she continued, "but I will give you a lift." This relieved Heather somewhat, she may still be naked but at least she could get home. She grabbed her keys from the ignition and was out of her car and locking it in a flash. As she finished a car engine starting over the other side of the car park caused her to flinch and crouch down slightly, reminding her of her nakedness.
<br><br>
"Where’s your car," she asked anxiously as she turned to face Miss Grey.
<br><br>
"Follow me," the store manageress answered and set off along the row of cars.
<br><br>
Heather looked around furtively and then scurried after Miss Grey, acutely aware of her lack of clothes. Fortunately for her, Miss Grey’s car was only parked about ten further along from Heather’s so they soon got there . But the clothed woman made a great deal out of rooting around in her handbag to find her car keys just to prolong Heather’s agony slightly longer. At long last she produced them, opened the driver’s door and got inside. She then lent across to open Heather’s door and as soon the lock was released Heather was quickly inside. Miss Grey buckled her seat belt and as she put the key in the ignition she looked at Heather who was sat there with her arms crossed over her breasts.
<br><br>
"Don’t forget your seat belt, dear," Miss Grey said condescendingly
<br><br>
Heather mumbled an acknowledgement and reached for her belt as Miss Grey started the engine and then reversed the car out of its parking place. They were soon out of the car park and driving down the road that was the way to both Heather’s flat and Miss Grey’s house. Miss Grey hummed contentedly to herself, as she drove. Heather just sat there in silence grateful that it was dark and that nobody could see in. They were about halfway home when, to Heather’s horror, Miss Grey turned into a supermarket.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" she asked in fright as they entered the well lit car park and her naked body was suddenly far more illuminated than Heather desired.
<br><br>
"I have some shopping to do," Miss Grey replied smugly.
<br><br>
"You can’t leave me naked in the car," Heather said in a shaky voice.
<br><br>
Miss Grey drove to the furthest corner of the car park, still well lit but devoid of other cars and turned off the engine before answering, "Certainly not, I have all the records for my shop in the back of the car, I don’t want you destroying them to get some sort of revenge whilst I’m gone."
<br><br>
"But I… I c.. can’t come with you like this," Heather stammered
<br><br>
"Of course not," Miss Grey laughed, "you can wait in the car park, there is a rubbish bin over there to shelter behind.
<br><br>
"You can’t be serious," Heather gasped.
<br><br>
"Yes I am, " Miss Grey snapped, "So get out of my car before I drag you out by your hair."
<br><br>
"Please," Heather begged
<br><br>
"OUT NOW!" Miss Grey shouted and so frightened was Heather that she was out of the car in a flash and heading for the relative safety of the rubbish bin which was about 10 yards from the car. Crouching down behind it Heather peered over the top to see Miss Grey striding off towards the supermarket. Close to tears she prayed that Miss Grey would not be very long, but deep down she knew that the shop owner would take great delight in prolonging Heather’s naked wait.
<br><br>
Heather spent most of her time slumped behind her bin. Occasionally she peered out from her hiding place in the vain hope that Miss Grey was returning, but each time there was no sign of her and she sat back down to wait some more. But then on one of her quick peeks she thought she saw a chink of light from the back of Miss Grey’s car. A faint glimmer of hope that the tailgate hadn’t been shut properly causing the light to stay on crossed her mind and looking across the car park once more to see if any one was near she plucked up her courage to go and investigate. If she could get it open perhaps she could hide in there until Miss Grey returned she thought to herself. She took a deep breath and after making one more check that nobody was nearby, darted out from behind the bin and scurried over to the car. She crouched down at the back of it and quickly tried the tailgate which to her utter surprise opened easily. But when she looked in she saw that it was full of books and records belonging to Miss Grey’s business and there was no way she would be able to hide in there as well. Despair almost overwhelmed her but then an idea hit her and for the first time that evening she broke into a smile. Ten minutes later she returned to her rubbish bin to await Miss Grey’s return.
<br><br>
At long last Heather spied Miss Grey approaching, carrying one small bag of shopping. She hadn’t really needed to stop at the supermarket at all. Heather noted. Miss Grey walked past her car and over to Heather’s bin.
<br><br>
"Still here," she enquired cheerily.
<br><br>
"Yes," Heather responded.
<br><br>
"Good," Miss Grey continued, "Well I’m afraid I met my friend Julie in the store and she has invited me back for dinner."
<br><br>
Heather had a good idea what was coming next.
<br><br>
"So I’m afraid I can’t take you home after all, you’ll have to make your own way." Heather now knew that she had planned to dump her naked.
<br><br>
But Miss Grey was rather taken aback by Heather’s response as she was expecting her to plead desperately rather than say, "Leave me here and your business is finished."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Miss Grey asked rather concerned.
<br><br>
Heather then explained that she had taken the liberty of removing all Miss Grey’s business records from her car boot and had hidden them.
<br><br>
"Give them back this instant," Miss Grey demanded trying to sound as if she was in control. But in reality she was now in trouble as she knew without her records she would at the very least have serious problems or more likely as Heather quite rightly stated she could be finished. She knew she had to get them back at all costs. She spent a minute walking around the immediate area to see if she could spot where Heather had put them, but to no avail. She finally returned to the bin and looked down at Heather.
<br><br>
"OK, you win," she said unpleasantly, "What do you want?"
<br><br>
"Clothes," Heather answered without hesitation.
<br><br>
"Right, I’ll go back into the store and see what I can get, they have a small clothes section," Miss Grey replied and turned away.
<br><br>
"STOP!" Heather ordered causing Miss Grey to freeze in her tracks, "I want your clothes."
<br><br>
Miss Grey gulped but said nothing.
<br><br>
"Come on," Heather added impatiently, "off with them."
<br><br>
"I’ll lend you my jacket" Miss Grey tried to bargain, the thought of being made to strip by Heather filling her with dread.
<br><br>
"No deal," Heather snapped back, "I want every stitch you’re wearing."
<br><br>
"Please, not here" Miss Grey pleaded, now it was her turn to beg and she did not like it."
<br><br>
"Right here, this instant," Heather ordered making the most of her new found power over her former boss. "or you’ll never see your shop records again."
<br><br>
Miss Grey hung her head in defeat, she knew there was no way out of this and she put her shopping down on the ground and then dropped her shoulder bag next to it. With shaking hands she began to remove her business suit jacket and as she slipped it off her arms Heather said, "Put all the clothes on the car bonnet for now"; so dejectedly Miss Grey did so.
<br><br>
Now it was her turn to look around nervously as she kicked off her shoes and then reached up under her skirt and with some difficulty wriggled her tights down over her hips. Bending over she pulled then down to her ankles and then off of her feet before placing them on the car bonnet. Heather watched with a trace of amusement as clearly she was removing first the garments that exposed her the least. Maybe she was hoping Heather wouldn’t make her go all the way, but it was a vain hope. Miss Grey then looked around again before undoing the waist of her skirt and stood there holding it up until Heather prompted her from behind the litter bin to "Get on with it"
<br><br>
Miss Grey then allowed the skirt, to fall to the ground revealing her slender lightly tanned legs in the process. Stepping out of it and then picking it up to place on the car bonnet she managed not to reveal her knickers due to the length of her blouse. She stopped again at this point, bare feet on the tarmac and looked round carefully before starting to undo the buttons of her blouse. Once they were all done she undid the cuff buttons and then took it off to leave her in just bra and panties. As the blouse landed on the car Heather tried to stifle a giggle as Miss Grey’s underwear was revealed to the world. Heather had always imagined that her former boss would wear very plain old fashioned underwear beneath her business suits yet her disrobing now left her displaying a bright red matching set of very skimpy lace trimmed silk bra and knickers. To Heather they seemed somewhat out of character for this prim and proper woman.
<br><br>
 Miss Grey was now extremely nervous, things had gone badly wrong for her, the humiliation of Heather had been great but now the tables were turned her stomach was churning.
<br><br>
"Can I keep these?" she begged of Heather in a last ditch attempt to keep her bra and panties.
<br><br>
"NO!" Heather answered in a commanding voice, " you stripped me, now its your turn."
<br><br>
Miss Grey knew she had no choice, and as her face burned red with embarrassment she undid and removed her bra which made her small pert breasts start to jiggle as she did so. Placing the garment on the car bonnet she then pulled her knickers down and off and hurriedly put them on the car bonnet before almost immediately crouching down behind her car. Heather wasted no time and came out from behind the bin and over to the front of the car. She picked up Miss Grey’s clothes and began to put them on. In a matter of minutes she was attired in the business suit that her former boss had been wearing a few moments earlier, it was a size too big but fitted quite well and was far better than being naked. The bra she had decided was of little use to her, Miss Grey was considerably less well developed in that area than she was, so once she had put the shoes on, which were also a size too big, she went and put it in the bin. A feeling of triumph filled as she casually strolled back over to the car and walked round to the side where Miss Grey was cowering.
<br><br>
She looked down at the naked woman and gloated. Miss Grey was on her knees, arms across her chest looking down at the tarmac, her long black hair hung down obscuring her face.
<br><br>
"Not very nice being stripped is it?" Heather asked
<br><br>
"No," Miss Grey replied in a whisper without looking up.
<br><br>
"No indeed," Heather continued, "And I think you deserve to be left here like you were going to do to me."
<br><br>
This caused Miss Grey to look up in fear
<br><br>
"N..n..oooo!" she howled which made Heather laugh.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Heather asked enjoying every second of Miss Grey begging on her knees.
<br><br>
"Y.yy. you can’t, I mean, woul… please," Miss Grey stammered close to panic.
<br><br>
"Of course I wouldn’t," Heather relented watching relief flood across Miss Grey’s face, "You can ride in the boot."
<br><br>
Miss Grey was about to protest but then thought better of it and under Heather’s direction she climbed into the boot and was still trying to get her naked body comfortable as the tailgate was slammed shut. Heather looked round briefly just to see if anybody had noticed what was happening but there was still nobody near so she walked over to where Miss Grey had put down her bags. Picking up the shoulder bag Heather rummage in it until she found a bunch of keys. She soon identified the car key and picking up Miss Grey’s shopping made her way to the car. Despite the boot being open the doors were still locked so she unlocked them with the key and threw the bags across onto the passenger seat. But then instead of getting in she crouched down and reached under the car. Several minutes later she had retrieved all Miss Grey’s business records from their hiding place under the car and put them on the back seat. Now it was her who was humming contentedly as she got in and in a short space of time was driving out of the supermarket car park.<br><br><br><br></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As Heather drove towards her home she stopped humming as the feeling of triumph began to fade and she started to wonder what to do next. She had successfully turned the tables on Miss Grey, now locked naked in her car boot, but didn’t know what her next move was going to be. As she wracked her brains it occurred to her that Miss Grey had fully intended to leave her stranded naked at the supermarket and she began to feel more than a little bit angry. Then she got stuck in the last of the evening traffic which always made her angry so by the time she turned onto the road that crossed the local park she was in a particularly foul mood. Half way across the Park which was more of a Common, due to there being very few trees, she saw the large car park that was provided for recreational purposes. At weekends it was usually full of families out for walks, people exercising their dogs and so on but on a dark mid week evening it was empty. A sudden flash of inspiration crossed Heather and she swung the car sharp left into the car park and then drove to the corner furthest from the road where she stopped and turned off the engine. She was about to get out when she saw Miss Grey’s shopping on the seat next to and out of some strange sort of curiosity she could not resist seeing what was in it. Picking it up she opened it and saw that it contained only a loaf of bread, some eggs and a large bag of flour. Heather became annoyed again, Miss Grey had deliberately left her in the supermarket car park and spent ages in the shop just to humiliate her further.
<br><br>
"The bitch," she muttered as she opened the car door, got out, and strode purposely round to the rear of the car. Pulling the tailgate up she looked into back of the car and saw Miss Grey lying there illuminated only by the small boot light.
<br><br>
"Heather!" Miss Grey began.
<br><br>
"Shut up," Heather snapped, "And get out of the car."
<br><br>
"Please Heather," Miss Grey whined, "Can I have some clothes?"
<br><br>
"No you can’t, Miss Grey," Heather replied curtly, "There’s only one set and I’m keeping them."
<br><br>
"Oh!" Miss Grey moaned
<br><br>
"And while I remember," Heather continued, "You can call me Miss Graham from now on," Heather smiled as Miss Grey nodded in acknowledgement.
<br><br>
"Good," she added and then a thought struck her. "What’s your first name? Calling you Miss Grey seems a little inappropriate in your current situation."
<br><br>
"Susan," Miss Grey whispered, somewhat fearful of Heather.
<br><br>
"Right then, Susan, get out of this car."
<br><br>
Miss Grey slowly and stiffly extracted herself from the car boot and finally stood in front of Heather. Despite the near darkness she still tried to cover herself as she looked about.
<br><br>
"Where are we, Heath… I mean Miss Graham?" she corrected herself.
<br><br>
"In the middle of the park, Susan," Heather answered making sure she emphasized the name Susan. After all she had never know Miss Grey’s first name all the time she had worked for her.
<br><br>
"Why are we h.. h.. here," Miss Grey stuttered knowing that she was not going to like the answer.
<br><br>
"Because this is as far as you're going by car," Heather told her.
<br><br>
"NO!" Miss Grey cried and dropped to her knees in front of Heather.
<br><br>
"Yes," Heather answered amused by the desperate look on her face. "You can walk from here, I take it you know the way to my house?"
<br><br>
Miss Grey pleaded and begged. "You can’t make me walk to your house naked," she wailed and started to cry. Normally Heather would have felt some sympathy, but the naked, tearful woman grovelling in front of her had earlier stripped her and then planned to leave her naked at the supermarket. Miss Grey would have shown her no mercy if she hadn’t managed to gain the upper hand so she had no intention of letting her off the hook now. Heather looked down.
<br><br>
"Shut up and listen," she ordered and Miss Grey still sniffing gazed up at her through tearful eyes, "and don’t interrupt!" she finished.
<br><br>
A small moan came from Miss Grey before Heather went on.
<br><br>
"You walk to my flat where I will leave your car, and business records, outside, I’ll leave the keys on top of the driver's side front tyre so you don’t have to come knocking. Understand?"
<br><br>
"Yes Miss Graham," Miss Grey replied and then added more desperately,
<br><br>
"Please can I have something to wear? Anything, please."
<br><br>
"Anything?" Heather teased her
<br><br>
"Yes anything," Miss Grey nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
"Hang on a second," Heather replied and went round to the passenger side of the car as Miss Grey’s hopes soared that she might get some clothing after all. Heather returned moments later carrying the shopping bag. Miss Grey still on her knees watched in puzzlement as Heather put the bag on the car roof and took out the eggs. She opened the carton took one out and quick as a flash broke it over Miss Grey’s head.
<br><br>
"Noo" Miss Grey squealed as the raw egg ran down her hair. She instinctively put her hands on her head and they of course got covered as well.
<br><br>
"Please, stop!" Miss Grey begged as the second egg broke over her head closely followed by the third. She shook her head wildly which just spread the goo further. By the time the sixth and last had been broken over Miss Grey the raw eggs were running down her body and she didn’t help matters by trying, in a futile effort, to wipe them off with her hands. In actual fact all she succeeded in doing was to spread it even more as she howled, "You cow."
<br><br>
"Language," Heather tutted, as she picked up the bag of flour and without Miss Grey seeing, moved up wind of her She then ripped opened the packet and emptied the contents over the forlorn Miss Grey’s head and quickly stepped back as the flour settled.
<br><br>
Miss Grey screamed in horror as the flour stuck to all the raw egg on her body.
<br><br>
"Oh god," she cried and shook her head causing more of the flour to fall and coat her body, "You rotten fucking bitch."
<br><br>
This momentarily startled Heather as she looked down at the flour and egg covered Miss Grey, she had never heard her swear before.
<br><br>
"Well, you wanted something to wear," she laughed as Miss Grey began to struggle to her feet. Heather slipped by her and got into the car; quickly starting the engine she spun the wheel and headed back to the main road.
<br><br>
"Don’t forget" she called, "I’ll leave the car outside my flat," and drove off
<br><br>
"Come back," Miss Grey cried and tried to run after the car. But she stopped, knowing it was hopeless, and watched in despair as it joined the traffic and disappeared. Miss Grey, who had started the day as a confident well dressed business woman was now dumped naked, covered in flour and eggs in the middle of a park. She sank to the ground and beat the car park with her fists in frustration.
<br><br>
Miss Grey knelt there for about ten minutes by which time she had regained her composure and to some extent her clinical business mind so as she finally hauled herself to her feet she was able to assess her situation. She reckoned it was about two miles to Heather’s flat, about a mile through the park and another mile through a housing estate. The first bit was easy, it being dark and there was unlikely to be anybody else in the park, whilst the second half through the estate she didn’t fancy at all. She also considered what she was going to do about getting even with Heather but then concluded that she, herself, had started the events that led to her being in this mess. Therefore she decided the beat course of action was to get to her car, get dressed and go home. Once there she could get cleaned up and forgetting all about Heather would probably be for the best.
<br><br>
She set off across the park, keeping some distance from the still moderately busy main road. She made good progress, although she frequently winced or cursed as her bare feet came into contact with a rock or twig. Being a dark cloudy night she couldn’t see very well but knew that conversely nobody would be able to see her. It was only as she approached the edge of the park that she started to become self conscious and involuntarily started to crouch more as she walked and cover herself with her hands and arms. As she got close to the road at the edge of the park Miss Grey realized she had come out at more or less the right place, she recognized the corner shop where one had to turn to get to Heather’s flat. A car pulled away from it as she watched and even several minutes later there was no other sign of activity so she decided it was now or never. She moved closer to the road and the shop until she was hiding behind the last tree there was and only about 50 yards away. Still nothing seemed to be happening so she took a deep breath and came out from behind the tree. She adopted a crouching sort of run with an arm across her breasts but had barely covered 15 yards when she tripped over something and fell head first into a pile of leaves. Miss Grey quickly regained her feet, only to find she now had dead leaves stuck to her as well as flour and eggs. She cursed Heather as she ran.
<br><br>
She reached the edge of the park and was half way across the road when to her horror two youths walked out of the shop. She stopped dead in a tracks right in the middle of the road, frozen to the spot, almost like a deer caught in car headlights. She stood there motionless watching the youths as they opened the tins of beer they had just bought. Both in jeans and tee shirts with close cropped hair they were not the types Miss Grey would have wanted to tangle with even if she was fully clothed One of the youths raised his tin and tipped his head back to take a swig but as he did he caught sight of the naked flour covered women stood in the road. He stopped dead and stared which resulted in him pouring a fair proportion of the contents of his tin down his front. He thought he must be seeing things at first but the damp feeling down his tee shit brought him to his senses and he nudged his mate without taking his eyes off of Miss Grey. The nudge caused the other youth to spill his beer.
<br><br>
"What the fu…." he shouted and then stopped as he saw Miss Grey.
<br><br>
At this point Miss Grey instinctively decided it was time to go and took to her heels and ran. The two youths immediately gave chase, they didn’t really know why, it just seemed the right thing to do and after all it wasn’t every day you came across a naked woman. Miss Grey ran as fast as she could she ran down several roads turning the corners at the end of them in an attempt to lose her pursuers. She could hear them calling after her which just spurred her on and it wasn’t long before the cries began to get fainter Eventually she dodged into a garden and hid behind a hedge. Gasping for breath she tried not to make too much noise whilst at the same time listening for the youths. Fortunately for her they were two hopelessly unfit specimens and had given up the chase several minutes before Miss Grey came to a halt. Once she was convinced they were not following she carefully came out from her hiding place and looked around. Anxiety began to gnaw at her as she made her way to the end of the road she was in and looked for the name of it. She found it and read it with ever growing despair. "Bristol Avenue" it said and it dawned on Miss Grey that she had no idea where she was. She knew the way to Heather’s house from the shop but that was it, she had been so preoccupied with losing the youths she had taken no notice whatsoever of where she was going. She decided to retrace her steps to the shop thinking that she would be able to find her way back from there so she set off in what she thought was the right direction.
<br><br>
Seconds later a car appeared and she quickly crouched down behind a parked van until it had passed. Miss Grey never got to the shop, for two hours she trailed around the streets not really knowing where she was, frequently hiding from passing cars and occasionally even having to avoid the odd pedestrian. She was tired cold and hungry and her feet were very sore when she came to yet another road end. Mournfully she looked for its name, "Clifford Road" her half numb brain registered as she started to cross to carry on along the road she was already on. Then it struck her and she looked again just to be sure, "Clifford Road", that was where Heather lived!
<br><br>
With renewed vigour she set off down the road looking for her car, knowing that Heather lived in about the middle. Miss Grey had never felt so relieved as when she spied her car parked outside Heather’s house. She ran up to the car and crouching down went round to the drivers side front wheel arch where she felt on top of the tyre. This was where Heather had said she would leave the keys and it was a relief when she felt them. She grabbed them and still crouching opened the car door before slipped inside. Before pulling the door shut she had a quick look round the interior whilst the light was still on.
<br><br>
"Shit!" she said out loud to herself when she realized that Heather hadn’t left her clothes. Pulling the door closed she toyed with the idea of going up to Heather’s flat to see if she could persuade Heather to give her them back. Then she thought it was unlikely Heather would so instead she put the key in the ignition and started the engine, driving home nude would not be that bad and in her state she would ruin any clothes anyway.
<br><br>
Heather looked out of her window when she heard the engine start and remained there as the Miss Grey drove off. She then turned round and picked up the mobile phone she had found in Miss Grey’s bag. She dialled a three digit number and a few seconds later said "Police". A short pause followed as she was connected before she continued, "Hello, I wish to report a car that has just been stolen…………………."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mark Johnson was 19 and lived with his father and stepmother. His father, however, was an engineer aboard a cruise liner and as a result was away for several months at a time and then spent several months at home. Mark's own mother had died quite some years ago and his father about 3 years earlier had got remarried to Julie, a still very attractive five foot tall red head in her mid forties. Contrary to popular belief Julie was not the traditional wicked stepmother, in fact her and Mark got on extremely well. Mark often reckoned he got on better with Julie than he had with his natural mother.
<br><br>
It was one of those evenings whilst Mark's father was at sea that Julie decided she needed to have an evening out. She wasn't a great one for going out, especially when her husband was away but every now and then she let her hair down and had "a night on the town". Therefore she contacted Elaine, their next door neighbour, and arranged to go out that evening. Elaine was in her early thirties a rather petite brunette, only 4 foot 8 inches tall , but she had a more than ample chest that Mark had noticed many times. His stepmother was not exactly flat chested but Elaine left her standing in the breast department. Their neighbour duly arrived just before 7 o'clock as Julie was finishing getting ready and Mark barely had time to exchange greetings with her before the doorbell rang again, their taxi had arrived. Mark bade them both farewell and settled down to watch the TV for the evening.
<br><br>
Mark awoke with a start. For a few seconds he wondered where he was, the room was almost dark with the only light coming from the flickering T.V. screen which was now showing some ancient film. He quickly realized that he must have fallen asleep in front of the T.V. and a glance at the clock on the wall confirmed this, it was three thirty in the morning. This didn't concern him, but what did was that he was sure he had been awoken by a noise outside. He listened for a few minutes and had just about convinced himself that he must have been dreaming when he heard a strange thumping noise coming from the front door. He froze where he was, every nerve in his body on edge, and listened' There it was again, an irregular thumping noise on the front door, someone or something wanted to get in. Almost shaking with fear he slowly got up and crept to the front door and stood behind it. Thump! He nearly shot out of his skin but quickly regained his composure and stood there breathing heavily, his heart going at a great rate of knots. There was only one thing for it, he decided after a short time, he would have to see what was on the other side of the door. Very quietly he put the security chain on and ever so slowly turned the latch before opening the door just enough to peek out through the crack.
<br><br>
The sight that greeted him nearly made his eyes come out on stalks. For outside was his stepmother kneeling on the doorstep completely naked with a piece of tape over her mouth and her hands secured behind her back. This explained the noise Mark had heard, Julie had been banging her shoulder on the door to try and attract his attention. After all there weren't a lot of other options open to her if she wanted to get into the house. Mark looked past her and saw Elaine cowering in the shadows displaying a similar lack of clothing. He stood stock still for several seconds and just gawped before his eyes focused on the pleading look on his stepmother's face, at which point a wave of panic swept over him. As he rapidly shut the door, and fumbled with the safety chain all sorts of horrible thoughts went through his mind as to the fate that had befallen the two women. He freed the chain and threw the door wide open, the two naked and bound women were not slow to enter the house and as soon as they were inside Mark slammed the door shut. He then went to Julie and pulled the tape from her mouth none too gently.
<br><br>
"What happened?" he asked, the panic more than apparent in his voice. "Shall I call the police?"
<br><br>
"Don't bother," Julie replied in a resigned voice, not failing to notice how worried he sounded, "Its nothing too drastic, we, err, lost rather badly in a game of cards."
<br><br>
"Lost at cards? You mean this is all your own fault?" he asked incredulously
<br><br>
"Well yes" she replied slowly, "although more Elaine's than mine," and glowered at the still gagged woman. Relief flooded over Mark and he sat down heavily at the bottom of the staircase shaking his head in disbelief , then he began to laugh.
<br><br>
"Nothing too drastic," he repeated. "You two go out for an evening and come back stark naked and tied up and that's not drastic. I'd love to know what you would call drastic."
<br><br>
With that he collapsed into fits of laughter and it was several minutes before he recovered enough to talk again.
<br><br>
"And another thing," he asked between giggles, "what happened to your hair?"
<br><br>
When Julie and Elaine had left they had both had had long hair. Julie's had reached quite some way down her back but Elaine's had reached nearly stretched to her waist. Now Mark noted they had both had it roughly hacked off at the back of their necks.
<br><br>
"I told you, we lost at cards," Julie informed him with more than a hint of annoyance in her voice, "now will you please cut this damn sticky tape off my wrists".
<br><br>
Mark was by now thinking straight again and he realised that he held the upper hand so instead of complying with his stepmother's request he I said
<br><br>
"Not a chance, until you tell me the full story."
<br><br>
"No way !" Julie responded
<br><br>
"OK, you can stop like that all night then," Mark told her, he knew when he was onto a winner. "Besides if I hadn't fallen asleep in front of the T.V. I'd never have heard you and then you'd have been out there all night."
<br><br>
After a few minutes of heated debate Julie conceded to his request to recount the evenings happenings and Mark led the two bound women into the lounge and helped them sit next to each other on the settee. As they shuffled about trying to get comfortable Mark couldn't help but notice their breasts. His stepmother's jiggled about as she shifted around but most of his attention was focused on Elaine's chest as he watched her pendulous tits swinging back and forwards at the slightest movement she made. Elaine was well aware that she was being watched and blushed bright red. She couldn't say anything, Mark was going to remove the tape from her mouth but Julie told him to leave it, she was clearly less than happy with her neighbour. Mark settled into an armchair opposite them and admiring the view told Julie to begin.
<br><br>
Apparently the taxi took them to their usual bar and everything went as normal for the first few hours as they had a few drinks and talked about nothing in particular. They were just beginning to feel the effects of the alcohol when about half a dozen male students came in, none of them older than 21, and began drinking together at the other side of the room After a few minutes of watching these students Elaine decide to introduce herself to them, no doubt given courage by the gin and tonics she had been consuming. Giggling to herself she grabbed Julie's arm and dragged her over as well and asked if they minded some company. The students naturally didn't and to cut a long story short they ended up going to a night club with the students and drinking rather more than they should have. although not enough to be incapable but certainly enough, especially in Elaine's case to cloud over rational judgement. One of the students then asked them back to their house, an offer which Julie tried to decline but which Elaine gleefully accepted on behalf of both of them! Not wishing to leave her friend alone Julie reluctantly agreed to go along so they left the night club and went back to this house went back to this house.
<br><br>
Once there, the drink flowed again although Julie tried to avoid it as much as possible. Elaine continued to knock back the gin; not that Julie was particularly worried, she knew from past experience that Elaine was well able to hold her alcohol. Actually she wasn't too worried at all as they seemed like a nice bunch of lads and when one of them produced a pack of cards and suggested they play poker she just nodded in agreement when Elaine enthusiastically cried, "What a wonderful idea!"
<br><br>
They then arranged themselves around the coffee table with Elaine and Julie next to each other on the sofa, two of the lads in the armchairs and the rest sat on the floor. Still Julie was not very worried, she was quite a good poker play and Elaine was no slouch either. The women emptied their money out of their purses, although they didn't have a vast amount left by this stage of the evening, and the students placed theirs on the table The cards were dealt and for the first few hands either Elaine or Julie won every time and it began to look as though it would be a short game. Then things started to turn around, slowly at first, Julie won the occasional hand as did Elaine, but the big wins were going to the lads. Finally Julie folded and was completely cleaned out, she sat back dejectedly, unless Elaine could pull off a miracle they would have to walk home as they would have no money for a taxi. The miracle didn't happen and two hands later Elaine was penniless as well.
<br><br>
"Well that's that guys," Julie announced "we'll have to be going now as it's a long walk home," and smiled grimly at them half hoping one of them would offer to pay for a taxi. Even if any of the six students was thinking that they would not have got the chance to speak as Elaine chimed in at this point, the gin now definitely having an effect.
<br><br>
"Right guys, I've got a deal for you. Lets play for clothes and if we strip two of you we get all our money back."
<br><br>
There was a bit of a murmur before one of the lads asked, "And what's in it for us?"
<br><br>
Julie opened her mouth to try and protest at what was unfolding but before she could utter a word Elaine responded.
<br><br>
"You get to see us naked of course and you can keep our clothes."
<br><br>
Julie was aghast
<br><br>
"WHAT!" she exclaimed in amazement, she couldn't believe what she had just heard.
<br><br>
Elaine lent across the sofa and whispered in her ear
<br><br>
"It's alright, I've been toying with them up till now," she giggled. This did nothing to allay Julie's fears but the cards were already being dealt and before she knew what was happening she was holding hers in her hand.
<br><br>
"I don't believe this," she thought to herself as she changed three of her cards. A a few minutes ago she had been facing a long walk home, now there was a likelihood she could be doing it naked.
<br><br>
Once again thing started off quite well for the women, they won the first few hands and the lads began to discard their shoes and in some cases their socks. In fact virtually all the male players were barefoot before Elaine lost her first shoe. She sighed and reaching down removed the article and tossed it into the corner of the room where all the other items so far lost had been thrown. Julie then lost both her shoes in the next two games to be followed by Elaine's in the next one. Several male socks were then lost and one of the lads lost his shirt leaving him in just trousers and underpants. Julie lost one of her stockings before another lad lost his shirt but this was then followed by her other stocking. She felt rather uncomfortable as she peeled it down her leg knowing that all male eyes in the room were upon her and she felt uneasy as she threw it into the corner. When one of the students lost his trousers, however Julie began to feel much more confident and she in fact quite enjoyed watching him take them off. This confidence was short lived as she had to dispense with her blouse after the next hand. This time all eyes were definitely upon her as with trembling hands she slowly undid the buttons of her white blouse before slipping it off and tossing it onto the growing pile. She felt extremely vulnerable as she sat there and couldn't help herself clutching her cards in the next round very close to her chest in a vain attempt to preserve her modesty. She wished to herself that she had put on a more practical bra that the half cup lacy item that she now displayed to everybody. The fact that Elaine was virtually fully dressed didn't help either. But things then went very badly for Elaine, in quick succession she lost her stockings and then her navy blue blouse. This revealed her black bra to the lads and she began to blush. Julie looked at her and decided that it served her right, her more than ample breasts were on the points of bursting out of her hopelessly inadequate bra. The flimsy material looked as though it would give out any minute and was barely managing to cover her nipples. Another of the lads lost his shirt before Elaine's losing streak resumed. She had a worried look on her face as she realised she had lost again, slowly she stood up, and reaching to her side she undid her skirt before letting it slide to the floor revealing her extremely scant black panties in the process. She then quickly stepped out of it and in one quick movement bent down picked it up tossed it into the corner, where there was now quite a pile of clothes, before hastily sitting down again. She pressed one arm across her chest as she did so, clearly the construction of her bra was giving her cause for concern !
<br><br>
The next hand saw another pair of trousers on the pile and the following a shirt and to Julie's relief the next another pair of trousers. The odds were starting to look better and despite the tension that was now evident around the table Julie couldn't help but notice the bulges in the underpants of those lads who now were down to their last item.
<br><br>
"In theory," she thought to herself, "they could win in two hands if the right lads lost."
<br><br>
But the next round saw Elaine lose and she had to take off her bra. Julie could tell she was sobering up rather rapidly now. She stared at her knees as she reached behind her back to release the catch and once she had done this she carefully wriggled out of her bra trying to cover herself with her arms. She failed in this as her breasts were too large and just swung free, realizing it was hopeless she sighed and took her arms away before tossing her bra away. The six lads just stared and Julie had to cough to return their attention to the game. The next two hands saw the remaining shirts go, the lads paying more attention to Elaine than their cards. Julie tried to capitalize on this but was dealt a disastrous hand leaving her to remove her skirt. She quickly did this well aware that Elaine was still the main focus of attention and besides her panties were nowhere near as brief as Elaine's. The game resumed and to both the ladies delight one of the lads had to remove his underpants. When the lad realised he had lost he just slipped them off to reveal an erect penis, obviously he wasn't particularly shy. As Julie gazed at the naked student she heard Elaine mutter, "One down, one to go."
<br><br>
The next round was a close run thing but another pair of trousers bit the dust. Of the five remaining students four were in their underpants and only one still possessed his trousers. Elaine, of course, was down to just her skimpy black panties whilst Julie still retained both her bra and pants. It was going to be tight.
<br><br>
The cards were dealt again and Julie picked hers up, another duff hand and it didn't improve so it came as no surprise when she was required to remove her bra. This she did unceremoniously as she was now fully intent upon the game rather than her modesty and wanted to get on. The next hand saw the last pair of trousers lost, leaving the women to win just once more. The following round was extremely close but to Julie's dismay Elaine lost her panties. Elaine just sat there and didn't move when she realised what had happened.
<br><br>
"Please" she began to mumble, "don't make me ta.."
<br><br>
"Just get them off," Julie interrupted in a menacing voice. Right now she needed to concentrate on the final hand and didn't need any distractions. Shocked by her friends command Elaine slipped rapidly out of her panties and sat nervously on the settee.
<br><br>
Julie watched as the cards were slowly dealt. Breathing heavily she picked them up and her heart leapt as she saw she had three eight. Once she had changed too cards she had acquired two sixes as well and felt able to relax a little. She might not have a winning hand but there was a good chance it wouldn't be the worst one either. She showed her cards first and then watched as the first lad declared his. She wasn't unduly worried when he produced three Aces but when the next lad had a Flush she began to feel the uneasiness creeping back again. She glanced at Elaine who was just sat there wide eyed watching what was happening. The next lad had three nines, now she began to seriously worry, it was all down to the last lad. If his hand beat hers then the two women were going to have to endure the most humiliating experience of their lives.
<br><br>
"Full House" the lad said jolting Julie from her thoughts.
<br><br>
"Me too" she heard herself say,
<br><br>
"What you got then"
<br><br>
"Eights and sixes" she almost croaked in reply, her throat had suddenly gone dry.
<br><br>
The lad looked at his cards and then at Julie before slowly breaking into a wide grin and as he placed his cards on the table said in a mocking voice, "Nines and tens, you lose" and then added "Lets have the panties."
<br><br>
Julie slid them down her legs and picking them up off the floor threw them onto the large pile of clothes. Her mind was reeling at the predicament they now faced. They had lost all their money and now had gambled away all their clothes in a futile effort to recoup their losses.
<br><br>
Julie watched in silence as the lads got dressed again. She tried to cover her nakedness as best as she could with her hands and looked forlornly at the pile of clothes lying in the corner of the room. She glared at Elaine who was failing miserably to conceal her naked body from the lads' gaze but her friend just grinned back sheepishly Julie looked away, she wasn't going to forgive Elaine for this in a hurry. She decided the only course of action was to swallow her pride and beg for her clothes back, so she took a deep breath and addressed the lads.
<br><br>
"The game's over now guys, so could we have our clothes back please."
<br><br>
The dark haired one who was more or less their leader turned towards her and replied, "Not a hope darling, a bet's a bet, your friend here agreed that we could keep your clothes if we won."
<br><br>
Another of them then added, "Yes and we won so we get to keep them."
<br><br>
"Please," begged Julie, " You can't expect us to go home like this."
<br><br>
"Its not really our problem" replied the first lad who was called Ian, " but I tell you what, we'll give you a chance to win them back, I can't say fairer than that can I."
<br><br>
"It depends on the deal, doesn't it," Julie replied grimly. "I'm not playing any more cards with you lot."
<br><br>
"No," Ian told her picking up cards. "We'll just cut this pack of cards here, highest card wins, easy as that."
<br><br>
"Yes, but what are the stakes.?" Julie asked nervously
<br><br>
"Simple" the lad continued, " You win and you get your clothes back."
<br><br>
"And if we lose'?"
<br><br>
"Then your friend here will have to cut off your hair and then you will have to do the same as her."
<br><br>
Julie didn't bother to protest, she did steal a quick glance at Elaine who was just sitting there and then said, "OK its a deal, but I shuffle the cards."
<br><br>
Ian handed her the pack, she shuffled them and then with her heart pounding placed them on the table. She heard the lad say, "Aces high" as he reached out and picked up some cards. Julie took a deep breath and slowly cut the cards herself. She turned the bottom one to face herself and felt relieved that it was a Queen.
<br><br>
"What you got then" she heard herself being asked.
<br><br>
"A Queen" she replied turning her card round to show everybody.
<br><br>
"Sorry dear" the lad said smugly, "I've got a king" and turned it to show her.
<br><br>
Julie groaned inwardly and she heard Elaine whisper "Oh No," to herself
<br><br>
"Please," she begged "We don't want to do that!"
<br><br>
Then Elaine found her voice and with more than a hint of desperation in her voice said, " Give us one more chance, just one, if we lose you keep our clothes, we'll cut off each others hair and we'll do anything else you ask."
<br><br>
Julie said nothing she knew this was their only chance as she watched all the lads huddle together and start to discuss Elaine's proposal. After a minute or two they broke up and Ian spoke, "Right ladies, you have two choices, you can cut the hair and leave now, as you are, or you can cut the cards one last time. If you win your clothes will be returned, but if you lose you'll leave this house not only naked and with cropped hair but also with your hands tied behind you and sticky tape across your mouth."
<br><br>
Elaine glanced at Julie, who nodded her agreement and Elaine then in a small voice said "We agree"
<br><br>
The cards were place on the table and this time Elaine cut them first, her breasts swung free as she reached out and picked up some cards. She didn't dare look at it, instead, clutching it to her chest. Both the women watched, hardly daring to breath, as Ian reached forward and cut the cards as well. He looked at his card before turning it to show everybody. Julie's heart leapt it was only a five. Elaine still had her card pressed to her naked breast.
<br><br>
"Well," Ian asked "what have you got," and then added, "Looks like you're in with a chance here." There was a pause, nobody moved, just stared at Elaine. Then without warning she suddenly slammed her cards face up on the table. Everybody crowded forward, then the lads cheered and the women sat back in shocked disbelief. It was a four!
<br><br>
Julie and Elaine just sat there not noticing as one of the lads disappeared into the kitchen to return moments later with a high stool and a pair of scissors. They just couldn't believe it.
<br><br>
Julie was snapped back into reality by Ian's voice,
<br><br>
"Who's first" he asked with a broad grin on his face and beckoned to the stool. Julie suddenly felt angry, after all it was Elaine who had got her into this mess.
<br><br>
"I'll cut hers " she announced and grabbing Elaine by the arm pulled her over to the stool and roughly plonked her down on it.
<br><br>
"As short as you can get it" one of the lads told Julie as she took the scissors from Ian. Julie needed no encouragement and proceeded to hack Elaine's hair off in a very short space of time. Elaine just sat there, she still could not believe what was happening and by the time she came to her senses her long hair was lying on the ground. The lads laughed at her and made rude comments before Ian told them to swap over. Julie wished she had been a little more generous when she had cut Elaine's hair a moment ago as she sat on the stool. The cool wood felt strange on her naked buttocks as she awaited with a feeling of dread the scissors in Elaine's hand. All too soon she felt Elaine take a handful of her hair and begin to cut and in a short a space of time her hair lay on the floor next to Elaine's.. Before the two women had chance to do much else Ian produced a roll of sticky tape and Julie watched as he turned Elaine round, crossed her wrists behind her back and then bound them together with copious amounts of the tape. He then did the same to Julie and as she felt the tape being wrapped around her wrists she knew they would not be able to free themselves. She was about to make one last desperate plea to Ian when he spun her round and taped her mouth up. At more or less the same time another of the lads taped up Elaine's mouth. Ian then laughingly said, "Well ladies, its been a most enjoyable evening, I hope you've enjoyed it as much as we have." All the lads laughed at this point as they admired the bound and naked women. Both of their breasts swung in front of them and there was nothing they could do about it. Once the laughing had died away Ian continued.
<br><br>
"Well, it's time for you to go home now so we will bid you good night," more laughs, "and if you care to follow me I'll see you out." Ian led them through the hallway to the front door. As Julie followed Elaine it she couldn't help but notice the way her arse wiggled and then she blushed as she realised the lad directly behind her was being treated to the same view of her arse! They arrived at the front door, Ian opened it.
<br><br>
"Good night ladies, we must do it again sometime," and then burst out laughing
<br><br>
Both women begged not to be put out of the house but with their mouths taped up it was unintelligible.
<br><br>
"No ladies, there is no need to thank us" Ian replied jokingly and with that the women were expelled from the house as with eyes as wide as saucers.
<br><br>
Julie fought back the panic as she heard the door shut behind her. Quickly she calmed herself and then suddenly realised that Elaine had gone.
<br><br>
"The stupid girl has run off in a panic" she thought to herself and hurried to the bottom of the garden and out onto the pavement. She looked wildly up and Dow the street but saw no sign of her neighbour and was just wondering what on earth to do when she spied her hiding between two parked cars. She went over and gave Elaine a kick up the backside, she nearly lost her footing in the process but it made her feel better and after all she couldn't speak to her. It was clear that the inability to communicate was going to seriously hamper their efforts to get home. Julie fought back the urge to panic and took stock of their situation, they were going to have problems but they were not insurmountable ones she decided after a few minutes. Fortunately she knew more or less where they were and therefore the way home, reckoning they had about a four mile walk of which about half was through a large park. That was the good part, the bad part was the fact that they were completely naked, bound and gagged, also Julie realised that if they didn't get going immediately there was a good chance dawn would break before they got home. Two other thoughts nagged her, firstly what would they do when they got home, the only way they could get in would be to wake up Mark and she didn't relish the thought of him seeing her in this condition. Secondly she was more than a little concerned that they might be caught in their current state, she was a shop manageress and the adverse publicity would very likely finish her career, Elaine was a teacher, she stood to lose her job. She managed to banish both thoughts from her mind and concentrate on the more immediate problem of getting home.
<br><br>
She grunted at Elaine through the tape and managed to get her to follow as she set off down the road. There was nobody around at that early hour so they made rapid progress as they headed towards the park. Twice they heard cars approaching and quickly hid behind parked cars hoping they wouldn't be spotted. They weren't and the cars passed by, their occupants totally unaware of the two naked women. They were within two streets of the park when things took a turn for the worse. By now their confidence was growing and they weren't as cautious as they had been when they set out. Therefore when they reached a street end they just walked round a corner instead of peeking first. Julie turned the corner and stopped dead in her tracks as she came face to face with an elderly woman. A second later Elaine bumped into the back of her. All three women froze for what seemed, to Julie, like an eternity, that was until the elderly woman recovered her senses.
<br><br>
"Of all the disgusting things," she spluttered, "You should be ashamed of yourselves, exposing your bodies."
<br><br>
"Great," Julie thought. "We would have to meet some old prude at this time in the morning."
<br><br>
"I'm going to call the police," she announced. "Your sort need locking up."
<br><br>
Julie decided it was time to go and ran down the street in the direction of the park, she didn't need to look round to know that Elaine would be hard on her heels. Luckily the park was not far away as they could not have run a great distance with their mouth taped up. They reached the park went through the gates and hid behind the first large tree they came to. If they could have gasped for breath they would have done instead both women tried to get as much oxygen into their lungs through their noses resulting in them making loud snorting noises. It took them some time to recover their breath and Julie was on the point of setting out again when a car pulled up outside the park gates. She peeped round the tree trunk and froze in horror. It was a police car and two officers were heading into the park. The old cow they met on the street corner had called the police after all. Julie slid down to her knees and then dropped onto her chest in an attempt to get as close to the ground as possible. She didn't know what Elaine was doing and at that moment she didn't really care, all her efforts were going into saving herself. As she lay there pressing her breasts into the ground she could see the policemen's torch beams as they systematically shone them around the area. She held her breath as one of the beams passed inches over her head but she wasn't spotted. Then she heard their footsteps on the gravel path heading nearer to her hiding place. She held her breath again and could feel her heart pounding when they stopped not ten feet away from her.
<br><br>
"There's no-one here," one of the policemen said to his colleague, as they shone their torches around again.
<br><br>
"You're right," he replied. "Two naked women running around, I knew it was too good to be true, that old girl must be barmy, lets go."
<br><br>
"She's not that barmy," Julie thought grimly to herself as she listened to the receding footsteps. A moment later the police car departed and Julie struggled to her feet. Turning round she saw Elaine getting to her feet and she exchanged glances before setting off across the park.
<br><br>
The rest of the journey was as uneventful as could be expected for the pair. They had to hide on numerous occasions from cars and also a few people on foot but at least nobody saw them. As they turned, at last, into their own street Julie made up her mind that she would have to wake Mark and to hell with the consequences. Besides she didn't want to be sat on her own doorstep when it became daylight. She made her way up her drive and tried to ring the doorbell by turning round and pressing it with her bound hands but it was too high to reach so she resorted to thumping on it with her forehead until it was opened.
<br><br>
"And that's basically it," she finished. "Now will you please release me."
<br><br>
"Just a sec," Mark responded, "I'll just get some scissors." And with that he left the room. He soon returned, and as well as the scissors brought a dressing gown and helped his stepmother to her feet and then carefully cut the tape from her wrists. Julie flexed her arms and wrists rather stiffly before taking the dressing gown from Mark.
<br><br>
"Thanks" she said as she did up the belt.
<br><br>
"What about her," Mark asked pointing to the still bound and gagged Elaine.
<br><br>
"She can stop like that until the morning," Julie said. "I'm going to get some sleep and then I'll deal with her."
<br><br>
"Sounds fine to me," Mark told her. After listening to Julie's story he didn't envy Elaine one bit, his stepmother would be out for revenge and he didn't blame her one bit.
<br><br>
Julie left the room and Mark followed her lingering long enough to blow Elaine a kiss and say "See you in the morning."
<br><br>
Elaine just sat there her eyes as wide as saucers over her tape gag and her breasts swinging around. She tried to talk through the tape but it was unintelligible and Mark just smiles as he switched off the light plunging Elaine into darkness.<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Was it all a dream?" Mark wondered to himself as he lay in bed and thought about the events of the previous night. The sight of his stepmother and Elaine naked bound and gagged with their hair cut short was something he was not going to forget in a long time. As he lay there he listened for several minutes but there was not a sound coming from anywhere else in the house.
<br><br>
"The other two must still be asleep," he decided, "after all they did have a hard night." Then he remembered that Elaine was still trussed up in the lounge and in a flash he was out of bed and hurriedly getting dressed.
<br><br>
"Somebody ought to check she is alright," he told himself as he buttoned his shirt, but really he just wanted to get another look at his neighbour’s naked body, especially her magnificent breasts….. As he pulled on his shoes he recalled that Julie had decreed that Elaine be left tied for the night.
<br><br>
"I’ll get some sleep and deal with her in the morning" were her exact words and Mark knew that today was going to turn out to be very interesting. In fact it was going to turn out far more interesting than he could ever have imagined.
<br><br>
Mark crept down the stairs and quietly opened the lounge door. He put his head round the door to see that Elaine was fast asleep on the sofa, still naked and still bound although he was rather disappointed to see that her back was facing towards him to him . He toyed with the idea of waking her but then heard movement from upstairs, Julie was obviously awake, and he decided that it would definitely be more fun to let his stepmother rouse their sleeping neighbour. So he slipped out of the room and went into the kitchen with Julie appearing about 5 minutes later just as Mark had finished making some coffee.
<br><br>
"Is she still asleep?" Julie immediately asked
<br><br>
"Yep," Mark replied trying to sound casual.
<br><br>
"Good, I’m going to make sure she really regrets last night," Julie added.
<br><br>
Mark was excited, "This is going to be fun," he thought to himself, knowing that his stepmother could be a devious bitch when she put her mind to it.
<br><br>
Julie poured herself a coffee and sat down at the kitchen table opposite Mark to drink it.
<br><br>
"Err, what are you going to do about your hair?" Mark asked her, looking at the remains of her hairstyle.
<br><br>
"I’ll sort that later," Julie replied, "but right now I intend to sort that stupid cow in the lounge, she really dropped me in it last night." And with that she downed the last of her coffee, slammed the mug on the table and marched through to the lounge. Mark made sure he was not far behind her and entered the room just in time to see his stepmother tip the still sleeping Elaine off the sofa. She awoke with a muffled cry as she hit the floor and this was closely followed by a rather higher pitched scream, although still stifled by the tape across her mouth, as Julie gave her neighbour a sharp kick in the back. Elaine was coming to her senses as Julie said, "Let me help you up," and with that hauled Elaine to her feet by her hair, causing her to emit yet another muffled cry. Still holding the bound woman’s hair Julie brought her face close to Elaine’s, Mark could see that there was a certain amount of fear in her eyes, and said, "Now listen to me very carefully. Last night you caused me to lose all my clothes , have my hair cut off and then be bound and gagged before being left to walk across town completely naked. Not only that but we were nearly caught by the police and when we finally got home I had to expose myself to my stepson, and it is all your fault!"
<br><br>
Elaine tried to say something but it was completely unintelligible through the tape.
<br><br>
"What did you say?" Julie asked in an angry voice as she grabbed a corner of the tape and ripped it from Elaine’s mouth in one vicious pull.
<br><br>
This time Elaine’s cry was not muffled and when she had recovered from the shock of having the tape suddenly removed she repeated in a small whisper, "I’m so sorry I really am, what can I do to make it up to you?"
<br><br>
"Well I don’t know," Julie replied, stringing the nervous woman along. "What do you think Mark?"
<br><br>
Mark who had been thoroughly enjoying the unfolding spectacle was suddenly rather taken aback at being included in it.
<br><br>
"I.. er.. I don’t really know" he stammered thinking rapidly. "How about if she cleans my bedroom for me," he finished lamely, not really sure how far he could go.
<br><br>
"That’s a bit tame," his stepmother retorted, "but if you like she can clean your room for the next month. She’ll also be doing it naked starting as of tomorrow."
<br><br>
Elaine didn’t dare argue
<br><br>
"But right now, I have something a little more daring for you, Mark get the scissors from the kitchen, she’ll need her hands for this."
<br><br>
Reluctantly Mark complied as he wanted to hear what his stepmother had planned, and he had just got the scissors from the kitchen drawer when he heard Elaine utter a pleading "NO!. Please don’t make me do that."
<br><br>
Mark hastily headed back to the lounge only to collide in the doorway with a naked Elaine being manhandled out of the room by Julie. He could resist a quick feel of her breasts as he pushed up against her, they felt so good.
<br><br>
"Cut her arms free," Julie told him and he did as he was told easily cutting through the tape and then pulling it off of Elaine’s wrists. Mark didn’t have chance to ask what was happening before Julie frog-marched the stark naked woman through the kitchen and literally threw her out of the door locking it behind her. He watched in amazement as Elaine pounded on the door and begged to be let in . Julie stood with arms folded for a minute with an amused smirk on her face before telling her, "I’ll let you back in when you’ve done what I’ve told you to do," and then she turned on her heel and walked past Mark back into the lounge. Curiosity finally overcame him and he rushed after Julie.
<br><br>
"What does she have to do?" he blurted out as soon as he entered the room.
<br><br>
Julie, who was just settling down on the sofa, looked up at him and grinned.
<br><br>
"Oh, nothing that difficult. I just want my car washed."
<br><br>
Mark was stunned for a moment and then laughed. "Lucky for her it's parked on the drive beside the house and not on the road at the front," he joked.
<br><br>
"Shit," Julie replied, "I wish I’d thought of that and I’d have moved it"
<br><br>
"Christ!" Mark thought to himself she probably would have as well!
<br><br>
"Well," Julie said suddenly standing up, "are we going to stay here or are we going to watch the entertainment outside." There was no need for Mark to reply, he just smiled at his stepmother. Julie decided that they would get a good view from her bedroom window and led the way upstairs, Mark’s heart was pounding as he followed her, this was better than he could have ever expected. Once in the bedroom they went straight over to the window and looked down .Julie was right, Mark decided almost immediately, there was a good view from this window, they would be able to see all that happened from their vantage point. The car was there and so was an uncoiled hose, but at first Mark could not see Elaine. Then he spotted her peeking round the end of the garage, a few seconds later she scurried out from her cover, clutching a bucket of soapy water, and went over to the car. It was clear that she had realized that the only way to get back inside was to wash the car as quickly as possible and she was sponging the soap on as fast as she could, pausing only occasionally to glance up the drive to see if anybody was watching her from the road. She wasn’t aware that Mark and Julie were watching her, although that wouldn’t have bothered her, she was far more concerned about being spotted by a passer by, or worse still somebody she knew. This last thought spurred her on to wash the car even faster and in no time she was turning the hose on to rinse off the suds, washing a car stark naked in broad daylight was not her idea of fun, but she knew Julie was mad at her and most likely had even worse in store.
<br><br>
Up in the bedroom it was apparent that Elaine was nearly finished and Julie said "I’d better go down and make sure she’s done it properly." But when she had gone half way across the bedroom she stopped and turned to Mark,
<br><br>
"On second thoughts, you can go if you want."
<br><br>
Marks confidence was growing all the time and he readily agreed.
<br><br>
"Good, it’ll be even more embarrassing for her" Julie added.
<br><br>
As Mark went down the stairs she called after him, "And make sure you take your time checking the car, keep her waiting."
<br><br>
"OK," Mark called back.
<br><br>
He reached the kitchen door, took a deep breath, unlocked it and stepped outside just as Elaine was turning off the hose. She looked round and blushed slightly when she saw it was Mark, after all he was not much older than some of the pupils she taught.
<br><br>
"I’ve finished," she said quietly at the same time as unconsciously shielding her breasts from Marks gaze with her left arm, "Can I come back in?"
<br><br>
Mark put on his sternest voice and replied, "Not until I’ve made sure you have washed the car properly, now follow me."
<br><br>
Mark then spent several minutes walking round the car finding fault with it, he made Elaine follow him and drew her attention to the bits she had missed. The naked woman was growing increasingly nervous and kept glancing towards the road, still fearful of being spotted as she followed Mark around. Finally Mark stopped and looked at her.
<br><br>
"Not good enough, do it again."
<br><br>
"NOOOO!" Elaine wailed as Mark set off towards the kitchen door. She grabbed hold of his arm to stop him and begged to be allowed back in.
<br><br>
Mark pushed her away and laughed. "Only joking," he laughed. "It will do."
<br><br>
Virtually sobbing with relief Elaine headed for the comparative safety of the kitchen but was stopped as Mark said, "But first you can put away the hose." Elaine didn’t argue but coiled the hose up as fast as she could before hurrying into the kitchen. Her relief was short lived, however, as stood in the middle of the kitchen floor was Julie with her hands on her hips.
<br><br>
"Having fun?" she enquired of her naked neighbour. Elaine did not reply but looked nervously at the floor. "I’m glad you're so interested in my floor," Julie continued, as Mark came into the room behind Julie, "because you're going to get on your hands and knees and scrub it for me in a few minutes." She then paused before adding "with this" and held up a nail brush. Elaine didn’t protest; it was considerably better than being outside.
<br><br>
"Before you start, Mark and I are going to have a coffee and think up more things for you to do so you can go and kneel in the middle of the hallway with your hands on your head while we talk about you." Mark and his stepmother watched as she did as she was told without protest and Julie then closed the door but before she could utter a single word the phone rang . She opened the kitchen door she had just closed and went into the hall to answer it.
<br><br>
Julie picked up the phone.
<br><br>
"Hello," she said, and then, "Oh Hi, Dave, whereabouts are you." It was her husband calling from some foreign port. "South Africa, well it will a few weeks before you’re back home then".
<br><br>
"Just as well," Mark thought to himself, "It’ll give your hair chance to grow."
<br><br>
"No, nothing of excitement happening round here," Julie said continuing her conversation and glancing at the naked Elaine kneeling in the middle of the hall. Mark shot her a withering look and Julie grinned back sheepishly before continuing her conversation. Mark wandered off into the lounge whilst Julie chatted to her husband but after about 5 minutes he heard his stepmother call, "Mark, your father would like to talk to you."
<br><br>
Mark wandered back to the hall to be met by Julie holding out the phone to him. Her finger was firmly on the mute button as she hissed, "For gods sake, don’t tell him what has happened."
<br><br>
At that moment a devious idea flashed into Mark’s mind, prompted by the events of the last 24 hours, and instead of promising his stepmother not to spill the beans he said, "Unless you're out of your clothes in the next thirty seconds and kneeling next to Elaine, I’ll tell him all that there is to tell.
<br><br>
Julie’s mouth dropped open in a mixture of shock and amazement and Elaine was heard to gasp loudly. "You wouldn’t do that to me?" Julie asked extremely nervously, Mark just grinned in reply. Julie clearly didn’t know whether he was bluffing or not and hesitated for several seconds. Then she thrust the phone at Mark having decided that he was not going to tell.
<br><br>
"Hi Dad" Mark spoke into the receiver,
<br><br>
"Hi, Mark" came a very clear reply from Dave despite the fact he was in South Africa. "You keeping alright?"
<br><br>
"Yes fine thanks," Mark replied,
<br><br>
"Good, and looking after Julie for me, I trust?" Dave asked laughingly.
<br><br>
"Looking after Julie," Mark repeated as he watched an expression of horror spread over his stepmother’s face.
<br><br>
"Just a second," and punched the mute button.
<br><br>
"Well, what’s it to be?" Mark asked the wide eyed Julie, at the same time he noticing a slight smirk on the still kneeling Elaine’s face. Julie decided she couldn’t take the chance as to whether or not he was bluffing.
<br><br>
"You bastard," she spluttered and very quickly pulled her jumper over her head frantically tossing it behind her, it had hardly touched the ground before her sandals were off and her skirt was on its way past her knees. At this point Mark resumed the conversation with his father.
<br><br>
"Sorry about that, some idiot at the door, where were we?" he continued. "Oh, I remember, Julie is behaving herself most of the time," he told his father. This brought another gasp from her as her bra flew across the room. His father laughed at his son’s seemingly joking remark.
<br><br>
"Good," he said, "make sure she stays out of trouble." It was Mark’s turn to laugh, firstly at his father’s comment and secondly at Julie as she virtually ripped her knickers off and unceremoniously plonked herself on the floor next to Elaine. She looked up at him and in response Mark motioned to her to put her hands on her head like Elaine whilst continuing to talk to his father.
<br><br>
It wasn’t long before Dave had to finish the phone call and Mark said his goodbyes before holding the phone up for Julie to do likewise. Quite what Dave would have done if he had known his wife had been stripped naked during his call but he was totally ignorant of the goings on of the past night which Mark decided was probably for the best. He put the phone down and there was silence.
<br><br>
Julie eventually broke it by saying, "I suppose you think that is funny," in a rather angry voice.
<br><br>
"No, not really," Mark replied, " I just thought that as you’ve had your revenge on Elaine here, it was now my turn to pay you back for the fright you gave me last night."
<br><br>
"Piss off," Julie retorted and started to get up.
<br><br>
"STOP!" Mark ordered in a loud voice that did actually make Julie stop and also Elaine flinch. "You’d better do as I say or I’ll tell the full story to Dad when he gets back," and broke into a broad grin.
<br><br>
Julie dejectedly resumed her position on her knees and looked up at Mark, she knew when she was beaten.
<br><br>
"Before Dad rang," he began, at the same time walking round behind the naked women, " You were going to get Elaine to scrub the kitchen floor on her hands and knees, well, now you can help her." He let that sink in before ordering them both to crawl into the kitchen and watched in delight as their did so with breasts swinging in front of them and bottoms wiggling behind. Mark wandered into the kitchen a moment later to see his stepmother and neighbour stood at the sink filling a bucket.
<br><br>
"Hurry up," he ordered in the most authoritative voice he could summon up and in a short space of time both woman were on their hands and knees scrubbing. Just for good measure he wandered over and picking up a plastic ruler that was on the table applied it lightly to their upturned bottoms.
<br><br>
The response was a couple of yelps followed by Julie hissing, "Bastard" between clenched teeth . He was just sitting down to watch them when the phone rang again. Julie stared to get up but was stopped by Mark.
<br><br>
"Don’t stop," he ordered, " I’ll get it." And went into the hallway to answer it shutting the kitchen door behind him..
<br><br>
The two women heard him talking on the phone but the door ensured they could not hear exactly what was being said. They presumed it was one of his friends and continued to scrub the floor . Both felt extremely foolish to have ended up like this but neither said a word to the other, Julie still blamed Elaine for the whole sad affair and Elaine did not want to antagonize Julie even further, so they just scrubbed. They were almost half finished when Mark strode back into the kitchen.
<br><br>
"Get up" he said sounding very serious, "We’ve got real trouble."
<br><br>
The naked pair exchanged puzzled glances and did as Mark asked, they could tell by his voice that it was no longer a game. As they rose Mark continued, "That was that pratt Ian on the phone, the one you "entertained" last night," the two women were now very worried.
<br><br>
"What did he want." Julie asked anxiously.
<br><br>
"He said he had one or two little ideas on how you might like to get back the clothes you lost last night."
<br><br>
"No chance," Julie retorted.
<br><br>
"He can keep the clothes," Elaine added.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately," Mark interrupted, "there is a catch." Both women turned ashen as he went on, "Apparently Ian and his chums had a hidden camera and if you don’t want to attempt to get your clothes back they will post pictures of the whole evening on the Internet." Elaine gasped in horror whilst Julie just stared at Mark in disbelief.
<br><br>
"That’s blackmail," she cried
<br><br>
"I suppose your right," Mark agreed sadly, "but do you really have any choice?"
<br><br>
There was silence in the room for over a minute whilst they all tried to think of a way out of the situation. Nothing was forthcoming and at last Elaine sighed and said, "What do we have to do for him?"
<br><br>
Mark looked at her and replied " I don’t really know, all I have is a place we have to go to."
<br><br>
"We?" Julie queried, "What’s it got to do with you?"
<br><br>
"I don’t know," Mark answered, "but I was told I have to drive you."
<br><br>
"Oh well" Julie said, " We’d better get some clothes and prepare to be humiliated again."
<br><br>
"I’m afraid not," Mark told them uneasily. "Ian said you are only to wear shoes and coats and nothing else."
<br><br>
"I’m not doing that." Elaine blurted, " He can get lost"
<br><br>
"Oh shut up," Julie ordered putting on her stern voice. "Remember it was you who caused all this."
<br><br>
Elaine didn’t respond, she knew Julie was right.
<br><br>
"I’ll lend you a coat and shoes since you didn’t bring any with you," she added her voice softening again. Mark smiled inwardly at his stepmother’s veiled sarcasm and a mental image of Julie and Elaine standing on the doorstep naked and bound that previous night flashed before his eyes.
<br><br>
"Neither of you came back with anything," he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Julie’s voice brought him back to the present
<br><br>
"Where have we got to go?" she asked
<br><br>
"Quite a few miles out of town," Mark replied, "well into the country"
<br><br>
"Oh dear, I don’t like this at all, " Elaine added nervously.
<br><br>
Julie just glared at her and went to get some coats and shoes.
<br><br>
Five minutes later the two women walked nervously out of the house and went and stood by the car, they waited for Mark to lock the house and then unlock the car. Both were just wearing coats and shoes, as they had been instructed, being completely naked underneath. They were extremely nervous not at their immediate predicament, to a passer by they only looked slightly odd wearing big winter coats on a bright summer day, but instead dreading what lay ahead of them. Mark joined them unlocked the car and they all got in, Mark driving, Julie in the front passenger seat and Elaine in the back. As they set off out of the drive and down the road Mark explained to them that they were to go to a place where Ian had told him to take them and instructions would be there as to what would happen next.
<br><br>
"Bit mel<br><br>odramatic isn’t it?" Elaine said
<br><br>
"Yes," Mark agreed, "this Ian is one weird guy."
<br><br>
They drove quite some way out into the country before Mark turned of the main road and took them down some narrow country lanes, eventually they turned of these and went down a track which wasn’t even tarmaced, into a forest. Mark drove the car down the track for about three miles until they came to a gate, they all saw an envelope taped to the gate. This was obviously the right place so Mark turned off the engine and they all sat there, nobody speaking. Finally Julie broke the ice.
<br><br>
"Well, go and read it then, we can’t sit here for ever."
<br><br>
Mark just nodded in response, got out of the car and strode to the gate. The women hardly dare breathe as he pulled it off and tore it open . He then studied the contents before slowly shaking his head and returning to the car. As he got in Elaine could contain herself no more,
<br><br>
"What does it say?" she almost squeaked in a high pitched voice.
<br><br>
"Just get out of the car and take off your shoes and coats," Mark replied, "It says here I can’t tell you in advance." Julie shrugged and got out , immediately starting to unbutton her coat . Mark got out of his side of the car and walked round to the front to meet his stepmother. Julie removed her coat, handed her coat to Mark and then put her hand on the car bonnet to steady herself whilst she took off her shoes. At this point she noticed that Elaine was still sitting in the car and angrily told her, "Get out of there now or I’ll drag you out by what is left of your hair." Elaine needed no more encouragement and quickly joined the once more naked Julie at the front of the car. She was soon out of her coat and shoes and couldn’t help but glance around furtively . Julie stood there with her hands on her hips, she was no longer bothering to try and hide her nakedness.
<br><br>
"Now what, Mark?" she asked none too pleasantly, clearly wanting to get on with it. "I suppose you're going to have to drive off and leave us here?"
<br><br>
"Actually, no," Mark responded, "and don’t take it out on me, none of this is my fault."
<br><br>
"Sorry," Julie apologized "but lets get on."
<br><br>
"Right" said Mark, got into the driving seat again. He turned the ignition but did not start the engine instead pushing the button to wind down the passenger side electric window. Julie and Elaine exchanged puzzled glances but said nothing.
<br><br>
"Stick your heads through the window" Mark told them.
<br><br>
"Why?" Julie asked
<br><br>
"Just do it please" Mark sighed. Both women did so and Mark pressed the button to wind up the window.
<br><br>
"Whoa!" they both cried and quickly pulled back.
<br><br>
"What do you think you're doing?" Julie asked angrily, bending down to look through the window at Mark.
<br><br>
"As instructed," Mark said simply
<br><br>
"O shit," Elaine was heard to mutter under her breath as both women resigned themselves to their fate and placed their heads back through the window. Mark raised it once more stopping once the window was far enough up to stop Elaine and Julie removing their heads but allowing them plenty of room to breathe. He then turned off the ignition .
<br><br>
"What happens now?" Julie asked, nervousness clearly apparent in her voice.
<br><br>
"Er, I pick up your clothes and leave," Mark replied.
<br><br>
"MARK!" Julie cried
<br><br>
"Bye," was all Mark said and with that he picked the coats and shoes and walked off down the lane.
<br><br>
"Don’t go," Elaine cried desperately .
<br><br>
"Mark, don’t leave us," Julie called after him.
<br><br>
Mark ignored their pleas and walked about 15 yards down the lane before stopping and turning round. He was treated to the delicious sight of two naked female bodies squirming and writhing as they tried to free themselves. He stood and watched for several minutes as the women’s and bottoms gyrated around and their breasts swung back and forth as they tried desperately to extricate their heads. Then with one last look he turned smiling and set off once more down the lane.
<br><br>
Elaine and Julie were mortified when Mark bid them farewell, both tried to free themselves for several minutes before realizing it was futile.
<br><br>
"What are we going to do?" Elaine wailed
<br><br>
"There is nothing we can do except wait" Julie replied mournfully as the full impact of their situation began to sink home. Here they were in possibly a worse situation than the previous night. They were completely naked and trapped in a car window unable to do anything except stand there. At least the night before had seen them able to move around despite their bound wrists and taped mouths. Now they were helpless and at the mercy of anybody who came along. Elaine tried to get her arm through the window to press the window button but Julie pointed out that it wouldn’t work with the ignition off so they ended up just standing bent over and contemplating their vulnerability. It wasn’t very comfortable standing bent over at the waist looking at nothing but a car seat and after about 20 minutes both women were feeling very stiff. To make matters worse they were pressed close together to get their heads through the same window and as they moved to ease the aches their naked bodies rubbed together something that neither of them relished having no tendencies in that direction at all.. They spoke very little preferring to immerse themselves in their individual thoughts and wondering what would happen next. It was over an hour later, although the women had lost track of time, when they both stiffen as the sound of a car was heard coming down the lane. Their hearts began to beat rapidly and both broke into a sweat.
<br><br>
"O god" Julie moaned as the sound of the car grew louder.
<br><br>
Elaine screwed her eyes shut and just started saying, "Oh shit, oh shit" over and over again.
<br><br>
The car pulled up behind the one imprisoning the hapless pair and someone got out, frustratingly the women were powerless to see who it was only able to look at the passenger seat. They heard footsteps come round behind them, Julie held her breath, Elaine just kept repeating "O Shit!"
<br><br>
Julie took a deep breath and plucked up courage to speak.
<br><br>
"Can you help us please?" she asked in a wavering voice
<br><br>
Silence greeted her.
<br><br>
"Please," she asked again.
<br><br>
"I was just admiring the view, besides I recognize those hair cuts anywhere" a voice behind them spoke, Julie felt a mixture of relieve and apprehension, it was Ian.
<br><br>
"Comfy, ladies?" he asked
<br><br>
"No, let us go and give us our clothes," Julie told him
<br><br>
"Yes", Elaine joined in, " haven’t you had enough fun at our expense?"
<br><br>
"I haven’t got your clothes," Ian informed them, "but if you do what I ask you’ll get them back."
<br><br>
"No way," Elaine retorted
<br><br>
"Yes, go to hell," Julie joined in.
<br><br>
"Right then, if that’s how you feel then I’ll be off," Ian curtly told them.
<br><br>
As the women heard his footsteps leaving they conceded defeat and Julie called out, "Come back, don’t leave us, we’ll do what you ask."
<br><br>
"Yes we will," Elaine added in a panicky voice.
<br><br>
The footsteps returned.
<br><br>
"I thought you’d see it my way," Ian said mockingly and went round to the drivers side of the car. He leant in turned the ignition and then lowered the window to allow the women to get their heads out. As they carefully stood up stretching their stiff backs Ian raised the window of the car again before going to the rear and opening the boot. Much to the puzzlement of Julie And Elaine he then took the spare wheel out and went and put it in his own car before returning and locking up Julie’s. The naked pair stood there and watched but didn’t dare ask what was happening, they just knew they wouldn’t enjoy whatever Ian had cooked up. As he put the keys to Julie’s car in his pocket he turned to them and said, "Right, get into the back of my car, we’re going for a ride."
<br><br>
The two women stood there and didn’t move.
<br><br>
""Come on," Ian urged, "unless you want to be left here naked and locked out of your car."
<br><br>
That did the trick and they quickly got into the back of the car. Ian got behind the wheel, started the engine and set off down the track.
<br><br>
Julie and Elaine said nothing as they trundled down the track, they exchanged worried glances but remained silent, Ian began to whistle tunelessly to himself and started to aim for the potholes in the road. It was a poor surface and there were plenty of them, each time the car lurched through one he glance in his rear view mirror and caught sight of two pairs of naked breasts swinging wildly . After a while Julie realized what was happening and blushing she put one arm across her chest to block his view, Elaine soon copied her. Finally they reached the end of the track where it joined the narrow county lane and turned into a small car park. Julie and Elaine shrank down in their seats as they realized there were several cars parked there already but fortunately there was nobody in them, the occupants were no doubt walking in the forest. Ian turned off the engine and turned round to the women.
<br><br>
"Time to get out," he said smiling.
<br><br>
"What’s going to happen?" Elaine asked nervously, "Where are our clothes?"
<br><br>
"Yes, please can we have them now," Julie added.
<br><br>
"Come on out of the car and I’ll explain what you have to do." Was all Ian said in reply. Both women groaned and slipped out of the car before crouching down behind the side that shielded them from the road. Ian went to the boot opened it, removed the spare wheel and a length of chain and then went round to the hiding women. "All you have to do is walk back down the lane," he began to tell them, "Then get in your car and drive back here, I’ll leave your clothes behind that tree over there."
<br><br>
Julie felt a sudden flush of anger.
<br><br>
"So its as simple as that," she spat. "We just walk down a lane completely naked and then drive back down it equally naked, what guarantee have we got that you will leave our clothes here."
<br><br>
Ian didn’t bat an eyelid at Julie’s outburst; instead he replied, "Your clothes will be here, and that’s a promise, if I wasn’t going to leave them I’d tell you. But I thought an ordinary walk down the lane would be a bit boring so I’ve made it a bit more of a challenge."
<br><br>
With that he picked up one end of the chain grabbed Elaine’s wrist and snapped on a handcuff which was fastened to the end of it. Elaine snatched her wrist away but it was too late she was secured.
<br><br>
"I made these specially," Mark told them as he threaded the other end of the chain through the spare wheel and then approached a retreating Julie.
<br><br>
"Wrist, now!" he ordered, "or I leave you both here as you are."
<br><br>
Julie slowly held out her arm and Ian fastened the other handcuff to her. He then took her car keys out of his pocket, tied a piece of string to them and hung them around Elaine’s neck so they wouldn’t get lost. "There we are" he said standing back to admire his handiwork, "That should make things a bit more interesting." Both women pulled on the chain which was about ten feet long and then realized that not only would they have to walk back to the car naked but they would be chained together and also have a car wheel for company.
<br><br>
"You can’t do this," Julie pleaded, "It must be miles to our car, somebody might see us"
<br><br>
"I can and I will," Ian replied, " and anyway its only 2 ½ miles to your car so stop moaning and get walking .
<br><br>
"Oh no!" Elaine wailed
<br><br>
"Just get going," Ian ordered, "or I’ll not leave you any clothes at all, and by the way the keys to the handcuffs are in your car boot."
<br><br>
Elaine stated to plead again but was cut short by Julie, "Come on lets get going before somebody sees us."
<br><br>
Elaine saw her point and between them they picked up the spare wheel, and set off, carrying it flat they managed to pile the excess chain on top to save them tripping over it. As they left the car park and set off down the track it was soon apparent that progress was going to be slow, in fact, painfully slow; bare feet on a rough track meant that they were soon hobbling along with very painful feet.
<br><br>
Ian watched as they disappeared out of sight down the lane, smiling to himself. As he did a figure emerged from the nearby trees and came and stood by him.
<br><br>
"I can’t believe they’re actually doing this," the new arrival said.
<br><br>
"Well it was your idea," Ian responded, "you’ve got a mind more devious than mine."
<br><br>
"Yes, I suppose I have," came the reply, "and I wonder what they’ll do when they find out there never was a camera at all."
<br><br>
"I would rather know what will happen when they find out this was all your idea," Ian laughed
<br><br>
"Who says I’m going to tell them........" replied a grinning Mark.
<br><br>
Elaine and Julie were struggling, the tyre was getting heavier and they’re feet were killing them. Both women were covered in sweat as they headed down the track, they said little other than to encourage each other to keep going, it was obvious that the quicker progress they made the sooner their ordeal would be over . But they were soon flagging and then Elaine stumbled and fell, she lay flat on her face and sobbed, "I can’t go on, I just can’t."
<br><br>
"Get up please" Julie pleaded, "We’ve got to keep going."
<br><br>
"No, I can’t," Elaine just lay there and Julie lost her cool.
<br><br>
"GET UP NOW, YOU FUCKING BITCH," she yelled, "OR I’LL KICK YOU ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CAR."
<br><br>
Elaine had never heard Julie speak like that before and looked up at her in amazement. Julie was about to unleash another tirade when the both heard voices ahead of them.
<br><br>
"Quick, into the trees," Julie ordered in a hushed voice as they frantically picked up the wheel and headed for relative safety of the trees. Unfortunately they forgot about the chain connecting them and it caught around Elaine’s ankle as they were about to cross a very large ditch. She tripped and went headfirst into it and in the process the wheel and Julie followed. It was about half full of muddy water, and both women spluttered as they spat some of it out of their mouths. They froze as the voices were heard again and then sunk as low as they could into the water which meant that only their heads were not immersed. They held their breath and listened.
<br><br>
"Mummy, I heard a noise from over there, do you think it’s a wild animal?" a child’s voice enquired.
<br><br>
"It could be, Kathleen, after all we are in a forest" the mother answered
<br><br>
"Can we go and look?" a small boy asked. The women sunk even lower into the ditch, that was all they needed, to be discovered by a family out for a walk, they hardly dare breath.
<br><br>
"No you can’t," a voice that belonged to the father replied. "You leave the animals alone." And with that the voices got fainter as the family continued along the track. Both women breathed out in relief but they dared not move for at least another five minutes. Finally they decided the coast was clear and struggled back onto the track complete with their wheel only now they were covered from head to toe in mud which in the sun soon began to dry on their bodies. The rest of the journey whilst slow was uneventful and their hearts soared as they rounded a corner to see the car sat there. They covered the last 100 yards in double quick time . Elaine collapsed exhausted against it as Julie grabbed the key hanging around her neck and unlocked the boot. The handcuff keys were there and in no time at all they were free and heading down the track. When they got to the car park there were no cars left but a figure was sat next to the tree where their clothes were hidden. They recognized it as Mark and drove over. He stood up as they stopped the car.
<br><br>
"You made it then?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Elaine replied as she ran over to get their clothes.
<br><br>
"Fall in a ditch," Mark enquired noting her muddy form.
<br><br>
"More or less," Julie answered him, "I’ll tell you on the way home but where have you been all this time?"
<br><br>
As the two women dressed Mark told them how he had had to walk down the lane and until he met Ian . He had then been driven miles away and made to walk back to the car park . It wasn’t true but the women believed him.
<br><br>
"I’ll ride in the back wear the seats are clean," he laughed getting in.
<br><br>
The women got in the front and as they drove off Julie asked, "Did you get the photos?"
<br><br>
"Apparently, there never were any," Mark informed them trying to sound sad.
<br><br>
"SHIT!" both women cried simultaneously.<br><br>

Marion was just finishing making lunch for herself and her husband when the phone rang. She put down the cloth she had in her hand and headed for the phone that was mounted on the kitchen wall. As she did so she glanced at the clock and noted that her husband Brian would be home in 15 minutes. She picked up the phone and said, "Hello"
<br><br>
"Marion Leigh?" a gruff voice asked
<br><br>
"Speaking" she replied
<br><br>
"Do exactly as you are told or you'll never see your husband again."
<br><br>
"WHAT' w... who is this?" she stammered suddenly feeling extremely scared.
<br><br>
"Never mind who, we have your husband, do as you are told or else."
<br><br>
"But I '..who'.?" she tried to speak coherently but failed her mind in a turmoil.
<br><br>
"Just listen , do as you are told and he'll be fine," the voice commanded. "If you try anything clever then your husband gets it."
<br><br>
"Please , why us? We don't have any money," Marion pleaded in desperation.
<br><br>
"We don't want money," came back the reply
<br><br>
"Then what?" Marion asked
<br><br>
"You have a cordless phone in your hand, don't you?"
<br><br>
"Yes," she replied mystified as well as very scared.
<br><br>
"Right, then go out of your house and walk down the drive and go and stand on the pavement ."
<br><br>
"Why, w.. what for."
<br><br>
"You do as you are told without question," the voice answered in a menacing tone.
<br><br>
"I'm s.. sorry," Marion apologised not wanting to antagonise the mystery voice any further.
<br><br>
"That's better, now do as I said and make sure you lock the door behind you"
<br><br>
Marion wondered what was happening but dare not ask as she did as she was told and in a couple of minutes she was stood on the pavement outside her house. It also crossed her mind that she was locked out of her house, but she decided that was currently the least of her worries. Her main concern now was to do what she was told so as to get her husband back, she was convinced that he had been kidnapped but did not know why and could not understand why she had not been asked for a ransom.
<br><br>
She stood at the end of her drive and looked up and down the street, she could see nothing out of the ordinary, it was early evening and living on a main road there was a constant stream of vehicles passing in both directions. In fact even she was not out of the ordinary, any passing motorist would have seen an attractive 5 ft tall curly blonde woman in her late twenties stood at the bottom of her drive talking on a cordless phone. She was looking again, conscious of her heart pounding, to see if she could spot anything unusual when she heard the voice on the phone speak. She pressed the phone to her right ear and placed her other hand over her left ear to cut out the sound of the passing traffic.
<br><br>
"Can you still hear me?" the voice asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," she answered simply, at the same time noticing that the manhole cover in front of her was missing. Despite her predicament the thought that somebody might fall down it flashed through her mind, but was quickly banished as the voice spoke again.
<br><br>
"You may have noticed that the manhole cover in front of you is missing."
<br><br>
"Yes, I have," she replied quietly
<br><br>
"Good, then be careful not to fall down it, the sewer is at least 25 feet down," the voice told her almost mockingly.
<br><br>
" I'll be careful," she assured the voice
<br><br>
"Excellent," the voice continued, " now I want you to remove your apron and drop in down the manhole."
<br><br>
"Do what?" Marion asked unable to comprehend the order.
<br><br>
"You heard," the voice said suddenly turning angry, "and no more questions or your husband gets it."
<br><br>
"Ok! ok!" Marion quickly replied as she hurriedly undid her apron with one hand whilst holding the phone with the other. She managed to pull it off and drop it down the manhole as instructed .
<br><br>
"I've done it," she said nervously placing the phone back to her ear.
<br><br>
"Right then, and now your boots," the voice told her in reply. She was about to argue when she remembered the threats she had already had so instead , with an uneasy feeling in her stomach ,she balanced on her right foot and unzipped her black patent ankle boot on the opposite foot. She pulled it off and threw it down the manhole and as she switched the phone to her other hand to enable her to remove her right boot she heard the splash as it reached the bottom. Her right boot soon followed it and she waited for the splash before putting the phone back to her ear. She couldn't but wonder as to the point of this but didn't dare ask.
<br><br>
"They're gone," she said dejectedly.
<br><br>
"Are you wearing stockings or tights?" the voice immediately asked.
<br><br>
"Er, tights," she almost whispered and blushed at the same time, discussing her underwear with a stranger was not something she really wanted to do.
<br><br>
"Take them off."
<br><br>
A feeling of shock passed through her body as the latest command sunk in and all she could think to say was, "Why?"
<br><br>
"Do you want to see Brian again?" the voice said in response and with a sniff Marion put her hands under her skirt and began to wriggle out of her tights. She was acutely aware that her she was undressing next to a busy road , yet she had no choice if she was to save her husband. The pavement was cold on the soles of her feet but she barely noticed as she held the tights over the manhole and reluctantly let go of another piece of her clothing.
<br><br>
"That's a nice skirt your wearing," the voice told her. Marion looked around wildly, her tormentor could see her!
<br><br>
"Where are you?" she asked desperately
<br><br>
"None of your business. As I said, nice skirt"
<br><br>
"Oh please no," Marion was distraught
<br><br>
"Come on, get it off."
<br><br>
"Please."
<br><br>
"NOW!"
<br><br>
With a sob Marion put the phone on top of the garden wall behind her and unzipped the back of skirt. She stood there for a moment clutching the waistband. The thought of leaving the phone and just running off crossed her mind, but then an image of Brian flashed though her mind and she knew she had no choice. She was just about to let the skirt fall to the ground when to her horror she saw a middle aged couple walking their dog coming towards her. She stood knees trembling , barefoot and holding her skirt waistband, as they approached
<br><br>
"Good evening and mind the hole," she said and forced a smile, at least it was no-one she knew.
<br><br>
"Evening," the man replied warily looking at her bare feet as he avoided the open manhole. The woman just looked at her with disdain and they both passed by. As soon as they were a safe distance away she grabbed the phone with her left hand while still holding her skirt with the right.
<br><br>
"I can't do this," she hissed into it, "I was nearly seen."
<br><br>
"I see," the voice said, "it really depends how much you love your husband doesn't it." Marion felt as though she had been punched in the stomach , whoever was on the other end of the phone had her over a barrel .She didn't try and argue further, instead she let go of her skirt and felt it slide down her legs. Stepping out of it she kicked it down the manhole as she said into the phone,
<br><br>
"Happy now?"
<br><br>
"I see you're wearing a slip" the voice said ignoring her question.
<br><br>
"Obviously," she said watching the traffic go by and wondering if anyone was noticing her.
<br><br>
"In that case you won't mind taking off your blouse, will you."
<br><br>
"I suppose I won't," she agreed grimly knowing that arguing was pointless and she clung to the hope that if she co-operated she might get to keep at least some of her clothes. Putting the phone on the wall again she unbuttoned her light pink blouse , undid the sleeve buttons and in one swift movement slipped it off and dropped it down the hole. She then quickly picked up the phone and said, "Surely that's enough" as she stood on the pavement in just bra panties and a very flimsy full length slip.
<br><br>
"I'd like to know what coloured underwear you've got on," the voice replied.
<br><br>
"Matching white bra and panties" Marion said without hesitation, she wanted to get this nightmare over as quickly as she could.
<br><br>
"I need proof," the voice said with more than a hint of sarcasm. Marion groaned inwardly.
<br><br>
"Take your knickers off."
<br><br>
Marion felt a small amount of relief at this , she was expecting to be told to take her slip off . At least she would still look decent from a distance she thought to herself as she put the phone back on the wall and carefully began to take down her panties trying to do it without making it too obvious to any passing motorist what she was actually doing. She got them off and leaving them lying on the pavement retrieved the phone.
<br><br>
"I can't see them down there," was what she heard as soon as the phone was up to her ear. "Pick them up and hold them up in front of you."
<br><br>
Marion did as she was told blushing bright red as she stood next to a busy road holding her panties in one hand and the phone pressed to her ear in the other. As she waited for her next order she began to shiver realising that it was getting quite cold , a gentle breeze was blowing on her uncovered arms and legs and her slip gave no protection to the remaining covered parts ,but there was nothing she could do about it as she displayed her most intimate garment to the evening traffic. Fortunately for her no one seemed to notice but when the voice said
<br><br>
"Down the drain with them," she didn't hesitate and let them go in an instant.
<br><br>
"What size is your bra?" the voice asked almost immediately.
<br><br>
"32B," she replied , again without hesitation.
<br><br>
"Nice, I don't like breasts that are too big," the voice continued, "and tell me what make is it?"
<br><br>
"Pardon," Marion asked not sure she had heard right.
<br><br>
"I asked you who made your bra."
<br><br>
"I.. I.. don't know" Marion stuttered , confused by the question
<br><br>
"Remove it and look at the label," the voice ordered
<br><br>
Marion sighed , once again put the phone on the wall and began to extricate her bra from beneath her slip. It took her several minutes before she finally pulled it out via the hem of her slip. She looked at the label, grabbed the phone and breathlessly said, "Playtex".
<br><br>
"Thank you," a condescending voice acknowledged. "No point in putting it back on is there."
<br><br>
"No," agreed Janet and without being told threw it down the manhole.
<br><br>
The breeze had now increased to a gusting wind and Marion was getting colder, a fact attributed to by the state of her nipples which were most prominent through the sheer material of the slip. The hem of the slip was also trying to blow up and she pressed it down on her thighs with her free hand,
<br><br>
"I've done as you asked, please let my husband go," she pleaded desperately.
<br><br>
"I take it you love him a lot," the voice said.
<br><br>
"Yes I.. I.. do," Marion answered as her teeth began to chatter with the cold.
<br><br>
"Well do the following and you get him back," the voice started, "when I say, you are to switch off the phone put it on the wall and then close your eyes and stand with your hands on your head facing the road. Got that?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Marion replied, relieved at still having her slip, however flimsy it was.
<br><br>
"Good, and on no account are you to move or open your eyes until the phone rings again, is that clear?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I understand," Marion acknowledged.
<br><br>
"Oh, and one more thing if you want Brian back"
<br><br>
"What's that?" Marion asked.
<br><br>
"Make sure the slip goes down the sewer as well."
<br><br>
"Oh please no, let me keep it on," Marion begged on the verge of panic.
<br><br>
"Not if you want your husband back."
<br><br>
"No please , I'll do anything else not that' hello'.. hello."
<br><br>
Marion sobbed silently to herself, the kidnapper had hung up. She put the phone on the wall and just stared at it for several seconds as she rubbed her arms in a vain attempt to warm them up. Then she slowly turned round and glanced up and down the road, there were no pedestrians but plenty of traffic. She bent slightly crossed her arms and took hold of the hem of her slip with both hands. She then stood motionless like that for a good 30 seconds before she cried out, "Oh Jesus" and with tears in her eyes she pulled her slip off over her head and then threw it down the manhole. Two seconds later she was standing locked outside her house completely naked, eyes closed with her hands on her head, displaying her body to the passing cars. She tried to shut what was happening out of her mind, she desperately wanted to run away but knew she couldn't, her ears strained to hear for the phone ringing but it remained silent. Despite the cold she could feel her face burning with humiliation and when a car went past piping its horn she knew she had been spotted. She kept her eyes tightly closed as several more vehicles blew there horns on sighting her naked form, her face continued to burn and her legs felt like jelly, her feet lost all feeling on the cold pavement as she willed the phone to ring. She lost track of time then suddenly a shocked voice beside her said
<br><br>
"MARION! What on earth are you doing?"
<br><br>
Marion immediately recognised the voice of her husband and opening her eyes saw him stood in front of her with a look of horror on his face.
<br><br>
"Oh. Thank god you are alright," she blurted out and threw her arms around his neck. "They haven't hurt you have they?"
<br><br>
WHAT' hurt who?" Brian was virtually speechless and in shock at having just discovered his wife standing naked outside their house.
<br><br>
"The kidnappers," Marion told.
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?" Brian asked.
<br><br>
"The kidnappers who rang me up and made me strip out here before they would release you."
<br><br>
"But Iï¿<br><br>½ve not been kidnapped , kindly explain what the hell is happening."
<br><br>
The phone started ringing before Marion could continue. She picked it up and timidly said "hello."
<br><br>
"You really are one gullible lady" a laughing voice told her and then promptly hung up.
<br><br>
Marion hung her head ,she had just undergone the worst humiliation of her life and it turned out to be a hoax.<br><br><br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Peter Simpson sighed as he put down the phone and lent back in his chair, the papers on his desk forgotten for the time being.
<br><br>
"I've got problems," he thought to himself, "Real problems."
<br><br>
Peter was well up the Executive ladder at the company where he worked , a position he had attained over quite a few years of hard work and a year ago he was certain to get a seat on the board.
<br><br>
Twelve months later things weren't looking as rosy, not that Peter had done anything wrong, he was doing his job just as well as ever; the problem was that he now had some serious competition. Peter didn't mind fair competition and if he had been beaten to the board by "a better man" then he would have accepted it but it was not "fair" competition he was up against now. There were two thorns in his side, one called Jessica Yates and the other Mary Bennett, and the phone call he had just had from the Chairman of the company had confirmed his worst suspicions.
<br><br>
The Chairman had just spent the last 15 minutes telling him how wonderful Jessica Yates and Mary Bennett were and what an "asset to the company they were" and he had finished by saying that they were "destined for the top". Peter knew better but could say nothing, there was no doubt that Jessica and Mary were talented but they also were a couple of scheming bitches who would trample over any one to further their own careers. They were both extremely good looking, Jessica being a redhead and Mary a brunette, and always dressed in expensive business suits and it was not surprising that their rise through the corporate ranks was at the very least meteoric.
<br><br>
James decided they needed taking down a peg or two, nothing that would totally ruin their careers, but something that would put them on hold for a while, or at least until he was safely on the board. He sat and gazed into space and thought, then an idea came to him. He got up and went over to a cupboard, unlocking it he then rummaged around in one of the drawers within it before finding what he wanted. Returning to his desk he placed the old leather bound address book on top of his paperwork and began to leaf through the pages.
<br><br>
He came across the one he wanted and picking up the phone dialled the number. He hadn't used this man's services in years and he hoped he could still contact him because if he could this would be the answer to his current dilemma. A gruff voice answered, his heart leapt, he was in luck and a few minutes later he was explaining the problem he had. Things were looking up.
<br><br>
A few days later a very flustered Mary burst into Jessica's office. "My house was broken into last night," she blurted out.
<br><br>
"Oh No," Jessica replied. "Anything taken?"
<br><br>
"Yes, but you'd better shut the door first," the highly agitated Mary told her.
<br><br>
Jessica did so before returning to her chair and saying, "Well, what have you lost?"
<br><br>
"You know those pictures we took last year."
<br><br>
"O god! No," Jessica interrupted. "Tell me you are joking!" She knew exactly which pictures Mary referred to.
<br><br>
Mary nodded dumbly.
<br><br>
"O shit," was all Jessica could say.
<br><br>
They had been celebrating their latest victory together at Mary's house one Saturday, and had got rather drunk.
<br><br>
They had turned on the T.V. at some stage and found that there was a horse race about to start on one of the channels.
<br><br>
"Quick pick a horse," Mary had shouted.
<br><br>
"What are we betting with?" Jessica had replied.
<br><br>
"The loser has to strip naked and pose for my new instant camera," Mary giggled in response.
<br><br>
"Its a deal," Jessica said and they both chose a horse seconds before the start.
<br><br>
Both women watched the race avidly and as it reached the last furlong it was neck and neck between their two horses. They were bouncing up and down and cheering as the horses crossed the line, it was a photo finish and so they had some more wine while waiting for the result. Very unusually it turned out to be a dead heat and on hearing the result Jessica said "We both win."
<br><br>
Mary immediately replied, "No we don't, we both lose," and with that she stood up and started to get undressed. "We'll pose together. I can set it on automatic."
<br><br>
Jessica who was well inebriated by then needed little persuasion and to cut a long story short they stripped and took about a dozen photos of themselves sat naked on Mary's sofa.
<br><br>
"What shall we do?" Mary whispered in desperation.
<br><br>
"There is nothing we can do," Jessica told her. "We just have to see what if anything happens. Right now I have a meeting, we'll discuss this later."
<br><br>
The two women then went about their business and tried to put the photos out of their minds.
<br><br>
A fortnight later it was Friday night and Jessica and Mary were feeling somewhat more optimistic, they had heard nothing about the photos and were becoming more confident by the day that they would not. Besides they were in the process of preparing a report for the Company Chairman and knew that if they played their cards right on this one then they would be in with a serious chance of seats on the board.
<br><br>
They both reckoned they could be on the board before boring old Peter Simpson, however good he was. It was late when they decided to call it a day and they had still not finished so Jessica invited Mary to her house for the night so they could complete it in the morning. Mary agreed and they packed the report into their briefcases and picking up their coats departed from the office. A taxi soon had them at the railway station and they caught their train with a few minutes to spare.
<br><br>
Being late on Friday night they had a compartment to themselves or at least they did until about 30 seconds before departure time when the door of their compartment flew open and a dark haired man in his forties got in closed the door and sat on the opposite side of the carriage to the women.
<br><br>
He glanced in their direction but they chose to ignore him. What they didn't know was that this man was the one Peter had spoken to over a month ago and furthermore, they would have been very worried if they knew that he was also the one who had broken into Mary's flat. The man settled down in his seat and made a couple more glances in the direction of the women just to confirm in his own mind that he had got the right pair. He was certain he had and settled back as the train began to move. As it accelerated he took a closer look, they were certainly an attractive pair, the taller of the two was a redhead and she wore a smart dark blue business suit with a skirt that stopped just above her knees.
<br><br>
Under her buttoned jacket the man could see a white blouse. The other woman wore a beige suit and hers also finished above her knee and was complemented by a light pink blouse. He picked up his paper and pretended to read it.
<br><br>
The train stopped at two stations and was just pulling away from the third when the dark haired man made his move. He knew that he just about had time to carry out what he had discussed with Peter Simpson before the train arrived at the next stop.
<br><br>
"Good evening, ladies," he began
<br><br>
Both women gave him a distasteful look and Jessica said with more than a hint of contempt, "Get lost creep."
<br><br>
"Snotty cow," the man thought to himself, "I'm going to enjoy this," before he spoke out loud, "Er I think it would be in your best interests to talk to me."
<br><br>
"And why is that?" Mary queried in a condescending voice.
<br><br>
"Because I am acting on behalf of a client, who wishes to remain anonymous, and he has something which I suspect you two would very much like back."
<br><br>
"The photos," Mary gasped.
<br><br>
"Correct," the man replied, "and my client wishes me to inform you that unless you do exactly as you are told the said photos will be sent to your Chairman."
<br><br>
Jessica and Mary looked at each other, no words were exchanged but they both knew they had to do whatever this man wanted or their careers would be finished. The Chairman was known to be a religious man and if he got the photos they might as well start looking for a new job. Jessica slowly turned to the man and said in a quiet voice, "What do you want?"
<br><br>
"Everything you have," was the simple reply,
<br><br>
OK, we'll sell our houses and all our worldly goods but it will take a few days," Jessica scoffed, although the anxiety in her voice was easy to detect. Mary just laughed nervously.
<br><br>
"No, no, you misunderstand me. My client requires that you hand over everything you have at this present moment in time."
<br><br>
"We've only got our briefcases," Mary said somewhat mystified.
<br><br>
"Unless your going to steal our handbags," Jessica added sarcastically
<br><br>
"As I said, you're are required to hand over everything including your briefcase, handbags and of course all your clothes," the man told them in a matter of fact voice.
<br><br>
"Piss off," was all Jessica could think to say.
<br><br>
Mary was a little more eloquent and managed, "I don't think so."
<br><br>
"Well, I'm afraid its up to you unless you want the chairman to see the pictures."
<br><br>
The two woman looked indecisively at each other. Then Jessica asked, "Basically if we strip naked for you we get the photos back."
<br><br>
"That is correct."
<br><br>
Jessica leant closer to Mary and whispered, "Well?"
<br><br>
Mary head bowed thought for a few seconds and then said, "We don't have a choice" and with that she reached down and removed her shoes before tossing them to the man's side of the coach. Jessica did not move until Mary said, "Come on, lets get this over with, give this pervert his cheap thrill and get the photos back."
<br><br>
Jessica then followed Mary's example and removed her shoes.
<br><br>
They both stood up and virtually simultaneously removed their jackets. As they did so the man stood up and walked over to their side of the compartment and he held out his hands to take the jackets from them. He then turned round and placed them on the seat behind him. Jessica undid her skirt and slid it down her thighs allowing it to drop to the floor revealing the fact that she was wearing stockings and suspenders. Picking it up she handed it to the man who placed it on top of the jackets.
<br><br>
Mary took a bit longer, her skirt had a belt and the buttons were a bit more difficult to undo. But she eventually managed and removed her skirt to reveal a pair of tights. These came off very quickly and instead of handing them to the man she screwed them into a ball and threw them across the train so that they landed on top of the other clothes. She then paused and watched as Jessica, who had sat back down, unclipped one stocking from its suspenders and peeled it off before passing it to the man. She did the same with the other one and then stood up, reached behind her and unclipped her suspender belt.
<br><br>
As she handed it to the man he noticed her hands were shaking, clearly she was far more nervous than she was letting on, and he was also aware that she avoided looking him in the face. Mary he surmised was more confident, and it was her who began to unbutton her blouse first and she was nearly out of it before Jessica started to undo her buttons.
<br><br>
Mary handed her blouse to the man leaving her in just her bra and panties and she paused whilst Jessica caught up. As soon a the man took the blouse from Jessica, Mary unhooked her bra and slipped it off, she threw it at the man and then slipped out of her knickers.
<br><br>
"Happy now?" Mary she enquired as she passed them to him.
<br><br>
"Your colleague still has some clothes remaining," was the simple reply.
<br><br>
"Come on, Jessica," Mary began, "I don't want to stay like this any longer than I have to." But Jessica didn't move, she just stood there as if frozen.
<br><br>
"Jessica!" Mary ordered, anger starting to show in her voice, "Get your bra and pants off now." Still Jessica did not move.
<br><br>
"Bloody Marvellous!" Mary exclaimed and without further ado she spun Jessica around and stripped her bra off
<br><br>
herself. She tossed it to the man and then with a sharp tug pulled Jessica's knickers down to her ankles.
<br><br>
At this point Jessica came to her senses and mumbled "Oh, no."
<br><br>
"Oh yes!" Mary responded, "Step out of these, the quicker we do this the sooner we can get dressed again."
<br><br>
Jessica did as she was told and the two high flying business executives stood completely naked in a railway carriage being eyed by an anonymous man.
<br><br>
"We've done as you asked," Mary told the man making no attempt to hide her body..
<br><br>
"Yes, come on, give us the photos and let us get dressed," added Jessica with one arm crossed over her breasts and her other hand covering her crotch.
<br><br>
"I don't have the photos, my client does and he will return them to you when he is ready. Besides there are some other requirements"
<br><br>
"Like what" Mary spat.
<br><br>
"You are to hand over your briefcases to me. I am aware they contain sensitive company information and they will be returned to you prior to your meeting on Monday morning."
<br><br>
Both women picked up their cases and handed them to the man, the enclosed papers were of no use to anyone but them and anyway standing their naked they had little choice.
<br><br>
"Can I have your handbags please?"
<br><br>
"No you can't," an angry Mary retorted, "give us the photos and let us get dressed."
<br><br>
"We've done as you asked," added Jessica.
<br><br>
"True," the man conceded, "but I don't have the photos, my client holds them and he will return them once he has a seat on the board of your company."
<br><br>
"Peter Simpson!" the women exclaimed in unison.
<br><br>
"That's right and he engaged me to take you down a peg or two and ensure he got onto the board before you two," The man finished.
<br><br>
"The bastard!" Mary began but the man interrupted.
<br><br>
"There is one more thing he requested if you would kindly sit down and shut up!"
<br><br>
The women sat down opposite each other rather taken aback by the man's forceful tone. They were not used to being spoken to like that.
<br><br>
"Now listen carefully. There will be no second chances," the man explained. "In a minute I am going to do something that you most certainly will not like. On no account are your naked bottoms to leave those seats you are sat in now."
<br><br>
The women looked perplexed.
<br><br>
"If you do," he continued, "Mr Simpson will send the pictures to your chairman."
<br><br>
He stared at them and then said in a loud voice, "IS THAT CLEAR?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Mary whispered, Jessica just nodded.
<br><br>
"Good," and with that he picked up the women's discarded shoes opened the window and threw them out!
<br><br>
"Nooooo!" Jessica howled and started towards him.
<br><br>
Mary pushed her back in her seat and hissed, "The photos, stupid."
<br><br>
The man smiled "I'll overlook that little indiscretion but from now on you remain seated."
<br><br>
"O Christ," Mary moaned as she watched her coat and Jessica's skirt disappear into the darkness. The women begged and pleaded but the man systematically threw all their clothes out of the window. Then to the complete horror of the women their handbags followed the clothes. Jessica began to cry as the man closed the window.
<br><br>
Mary, now deathly pale, spoke in a quiet voice. "What do you expect us to do, you've left us with no clothes or money. and we can't even get into our houses."
<br><br>
"I don't know," came the reply, "and to be honest it's not my problem." The man then looked out of the window as the train ran into a station.
<br><br>
"This is where I get off," he said, picking up the briefcases. "Be in Mr Simpson's office 9 o'clock on Monday morning if you want these back."
<br><br>
The train halted and without another word the man got out and shut the door behind him.
<br><br>
Jessica and Mary sat there speechless and it wasn't until the train was pulling out of the station that Jessica with
<br><br>
tears running down her cheeks sobbed to Mary,
<br><br>
"What are we going to do?"
<br><br>
"I don't know," Mary replied, herself close to tears. "I just don't know."
<br><br>
The two naked women sat there and desperately tried to think of a way out of their situation as the train accelerated into the night.<br><br><br><br></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Peter Simpson sat at his desk looking through some papers. It was five to nine on Monday morning, and outside Jessica Yates and Mary Bennett were waiting to see him. They were expecting to get their briefcases and reports back that they had had to give up the previous Friday night. Peter had thought long and hard about it over the weekend and had finally decided to move the goal posts. He fully intended to exploit the position he had got the two women into and make certain he got that coveted seat on the board for himself. He decided to keep them waiting for several minutes and as he did so he wondered how they had got home on the previous Friday. He had after all arranged to have them stripped and left naked on their train home and had got a full report when their briefcases had been delivered to him on Saturday morning by the man he had contracted. In fact he was very curious as to how they had got out of the situation they had been left and had already devised a way of finding out. He lent back in his leather executive chair and smiling pressed the button on his intercom.
<br><br>
"I'll see Jessica and Mary now, Sheila."
<br><br>
"Very Good, Mr Simpson," came an almost immediate reply from his secretary and seconds later the door of his office opened and the two women strode in. Both were dressed as smartly as ever; today they were clothed in almost identical blue suits with white blouses, the main difference being that Jessica's skirt covered her knees whereas Mary's finished several inches higher; dark stockings and black patent shoes with a small heel completed their outfits. Peter had to concede that they were two very attractive women but as soon as the office door was closed behind them they flew into a tirade.
<br><br>
"Where is our report?" Jessica demanded,
<br><br>
"Yes, you arranged to have it stolen, give it back," Mary added.
<br><br>
When they had finally subdued enough he simply said, "I have the photos, so I call the shots around here from now on." Which just provoked another tirade of abuse from the women.
<br><br>
Peter had had enough, although he was interested that both were more concerned about their report than their stripping and subsequent complete loss of clothes.
<br><br>
"SILENCE!" he shouted, and somewhat startled they promptly shut up.
<br><br>
"Right," he continued, "Let me explain how things are going to work around here."
<br><br>
"But," Jessica started.
<br><br>
"Don't interrupt," Peter abruptly cut her off and then continued once he had their full attention. "As you are well aware I have photos of you in er.. lets say, 'a compromising position' and it is therefore in the best interests of your future careers that you do as I say."
<br><br>
"Surely we can come to an arrangement on this," Jessica replied suddenly all sweetness and light as she started to lower herself into one of the chairs opposite Peter's desk.
<br><br>
"I didn't say you could sit down," Peter told her icily. He watched Jessica rise to her feet again, somewhat flustered at being treated like a naughty schoolgirl before continuing once more.
<br><br>
"I intend to have the next available seat on the board and until then you two are going to do nothing to get in my way - the photographs are my insurance policy."
<br><br>
"Bastard," Mary muttered under her breath.
<br><br>
"You can also be nice and pleasant to me and your other colleagues as welL," Peter added in reply to Mary's comment.
<br><br>
"Fuck you," she retorted angrily. Neither womAn was used to being in a situation where they could not be in control, it both annoyed and scared them at the same time, they had not been expecting this.
<br><br>
"You are treading on very thin ice, ladies. right now your futures depend on me so I'd start being nice to me right this instant."
<br><br>
"Go to hell," Jessica muttered.
<br><br>
"OK, that is it, you've had your chance. Evidently you have learned nothing from Friday night," Peter told them. "I'm going to present your report for you, with a few minor changes and a bit of tidying up"
<br><br>
"WHAT!" Jessica exploded.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" Mary added angrily.
<br><br>
"Listen, damn you," Peter promptly interjected to stop them before they launched into yet another tirade.
<br><br>
"I will present you report, and I will tell the board that you two are indisposed." He paused but this time the women said nothing, just a look of anger was apparent on both their faces. James took a sip of water from the glass on his desk and then went on.
<br><br>
"I was going to make you wait here but since you haven't learnt to be civil yet and obviously Friday night hasn't had the desired effect, perhaps a further little lesson is needed."
<br><br>
"Such as?" Jessica asked warily. She all of a sudden had a nasty feeling about this.
<br><br>
"Well you can still wait here whilst I present your report, but now when I am upstairs you will be waiting without your clothes!"
<br><br>
"You are not serious," Mary gasped. "You can't strip us here in the office."
<br><br>
"Damn right he can't," Jessica cut in taking an altogether more defiant stance. "You can't make us."
<br><br>
"True," Peter agreed, "but I'll just distribute your photos to the Board." Jessica immediately crumbled.
<br><br>
You wouldn't, would you?" she asked desperately.
<br><br>
"Not if you do as you are told," Peter assured her
<br><br>
For once the two high flying executives were speechless.
<br><br>
"I've got ten minutes before the meeting starts, so if you'd like to disrobe now I'll put your clothes away in one of my cupboards," he told them and then finished by saying, "I'll lock it so you won't be tempted to get dressed after I have gone."
<br><br>
The women did not know what to do, here they were about to be made to strip again and there was nothing they could do about it.
<br><br>
"I'm waiting," Peter Simpson reminded them as he leaned back in his chair and looked at the pair stood nervously in front of him. He was going to enjoy this.
<br><br>
In a repeat of Friday night on the train it was Mary who made the first move. She kicked off her shoes and slipped out of her jacket and placed it on Peter's desk. She then began unbuttoning her blouse, clearly realising that any further argument was futile, instead deciding to get it over with. She had undone her blouse to the waist, giving Peter a tantalizing glimpse of her white lacy bra, and was undoing the buttons on her cuffs before Jessica began to remove her jacket. Jessica was undressing at about half the speed of Mary so as she put he jacket on the desk, Mary had completely removed her blouse. Mary then undid her skirt and with a quick wiggle to get it down over her hips let it drop to the floor, then stepping out of it she placed it on the desk. Peter couldn't help but notice that she was wearing matching underwear which was skimpy enough to leave little to the imagination. As Mary started to pull down her tights she noticed that Jessica was still virtually fully clothed and fumbling with the buttons to her blouse. Mary paused once she had completely removed her tights and stood in front of Peter's desk holding them in her left hand while she waited for Jessica to catch up.
<br><br>
The tall redhead was undressing slowly, almost as though she was in a trance, having finished undoing her blouse she slipped out of it and put it on the desk in front of her. Then she undid her skirt and slipped it down her stocking clad legs but unlike Mary she didn't pick it up, instead leaving it lying on the ground at her feet. Putting one hand on the desk to steady herself she then raised each foot in succession to remove her shoes with her other hand. She placed the first shoe on the desk but with the second it toppled over as she put it down and it fell on the floor. She didn't bother to pick it up. As she ever so slowly started to peel down her left hold up stocking Peter noted that Jessica's underwear was altogether more conservative and definitely didn't come into the category of skimpy, being far more functional than her colleague's. About the only thing in common was that both sets were white.
<br><br>
Jessica continued to slowly remove her stocking. Mary was sure she was getting slower by the minute and she could have screamed out loud, "Get a move on you stupid cow", but she managed to restrain herself and after what seemed like an eternity Jessica finally finished removing her stockings and both women stood before Peter clad in just bras and knickers . Nobody moved in the office, Peter was just watching the unfolding spectacle but neither of the women wanted to be the first to bare their breasts to a man who was now their bitter rival.
<br><br>
In the end it was Peter who moved things on by addressing the half naked twosome, "Come on ladies, I did tell you I was rather pressed for time." And to emphasize the point he glanced at his watch. Mary glared at him but Jessica just stared blankly ahead as they simultaneously reached behind themselves and unclipped their bras. In unison they slid them down their arms, Mary's 32B breasts jiggling whilst Jessica's 34C's tended to swing a bit as they became unconstrained. Both bras hit Peter's desk at the same moment but when it came to knickers once again Jessica lagged behind. Mary did not pause, as soon as she let go of her bra her hands went to her waistband. Hooking her thumbs in the top of her knickers she pulled them down to her ankles in one swift movement. Peter got a quick glimpse of her neatly trimmed pubic hair before her bending over caused her head to obscure his view. As she stood up again he was able to study her now naked body in more detail especially as she made no attempt to cover her body. Jennifer on the other hand clutched one arm across her chest as she tried to wriggle her knickers down her legs and still protect her breasts from Peter's gaze. When she finally succeeded she stepped out of them but did not pick them up, her free hand flew to her crotch but not before Peter saw that she was a true redhead! He eyed them both for a moment before realising that he really was short of time.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Ladies," Peter said smiling, "now I'm a bit tight for time" he continued rising from his chair, "so if you would pick up your clothes and follow me."
<br><br>
He went across his spacious office to the side that had a row of built in cupboards, taking a small bunch of keys out of his pocket as he inserted a key in one of the locks. He swung open the door to reveal a virtually empty cupboard with several shelves upon which were just. a few papers. He turned just in time to see the naked women pick up the last of their clothes, Jessica collecting some of hers from the floor, and head towards him. Nothing was said as they put their clothes in the cupboard, Mary placed hers on the top shelf and Jessica put hers on the shelf below.
<br><br>
As they stood back Peter closed the door and locked the door, both women had a sinking feeling in their stomachs as they watched Peter remove the key and place it in his pocket.
<br><br>
He walked briskly over to his desk and picking up his briefcase headed for the door. He was half way across his office when the door opened and in walked Sheila. Mary gasped and quickly covered her breasts with one hand and her crotch with the other. Jessica on the other hand let out a high pitched scream and hurriedly ran behind Peter's desk and then hid under it.
<br><br>
"They're ready for you." Peter beamed at his secretary and then turning to the naked executives he said "Whilst I'm gone you are going to give Sheila the full details of how you got from the train last Friday to your homes."
<br><br>
"Oh no we're not," Mary replied defiantly despite her nakedness.
<br><br>
"If you haven't provided full details by the time I get back I will personally throw your clothes out of the window and then throw you out of my office," Peter told her and then added, "Oh, and you are both to do exactly as Sheila tells you." Then without waiting for a reply he exited his office and headed for the board meeting.
<br><br>
For several seconds after he left neither of the three women spoke then Sheila, the only clothed one, seized the initiative.
<br><br>
"I'd like both of you to stand in the middle of the office, please" she told them.
<br><br>
"We are doing nothing for you, you're just a secretary," Jessica was heard to say, none too pleasantly from under the desk.
<br><br>
"If you don't get out from under there this instant I'll drag you out by your hair." Sheila informed her in a commanding voice. This did the trick and shortly the two top senior female executives stood embarrassingly naked trying to hide themselves from a secretary. Needless to say they both blushed red, Mary was more embarrassed being naked in front of another women than in front of Peter, Jessica just wished the floor would open up and swallow her. Sheila then went over and sat in Peter's chair and then reclining back in it she surveyed Mary and Jessica standing cringing in front of her.
<br><br>
When Sheila had answered her phone on Sunday morning she was very worried when she heard Peter's voice. He never phoned her at home and, at first, she thought something must be seriously wrong. But then as Peter recounted what he had done to Mary and Jessica her Sunday morning suddenly became very interesting. Sheila liked working for Peter, he was good to work for and always very fair. She never had any problems if she wanted to have time off or finish early. Conversely she would work late for him if she had to and as a result Peter put a lot of trust in her. She was a medium height dark haired women in her late thirties, not thin but equally not fat and whilst attractive she was not what you would call stunning. She enjoyed her work and had no ambition to climb any higher up the ladder, unlike some of her colleagues who thought they should be higher up the company than they were. She was not jealous of those above her but what she could not stand were those who treated those below them like dirt. Unfortunately for Jessica and Mary, in Sheila's opinion they were the worst culprits for this in the whole building. They did indeed have a reputation for trampling over anybody who got in their way and treating their subordinates very badly. She was delighted that Peter had decided to take them down a peg or two and even more delighted that she was to be involved too. Several of her friends had suffered in the hands of these two.
<br><br>
An overwhelming feeling of power came over Sheila as she relaxed and watched Jessica and Mary. Their clothes were locked away out of their reach and they had no choice but to do what she told them too.
<br><br>
"Right, girls," she began, calling them "girls" just to emphasize the power she had over them. "Just to recap, if you want to leave this building dressed you have to do what I say. I take it you understand."
<br><br>
"Please give us our clothes," Jessica asked in a pathetic voice.
<br><br>
"Yes," Mary joined in, "we'll make it worth your while."
<br><br>
Sheila laughed. "Not a chance, and anyway I don't have the key, so tough."
<br><br>
"Bitch," Mary muttered
<br><br>
"PARDON?" Sheila asked loudly.
<br><br>
"Nothing," Mary hastily replied.
<br><br>
"Don't lie. I distinctly heard you refer to me as a 'bitch'."
<br><br>
"Sorry," Mary whispered, she regretted her remark as soon as she had made it, realising that antagonizing Sheila would only make things worse.
<br><br>
"You will be," Sheila replied ominously, "but right now we have more pressing matters. I need complete details of how you got home the other night."
<br><br>
"What if we don't want to?" Mary asked
<br><br>
"I don't think I need to answer that, but considering your reluctance to co operate so far I think a little incentive to make sure you tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
<br><br>
The two naked women exchanged worried glances.
<br><br>
"What do you mean, incentive?" Mary asked nervously.
<br><br>
"I'll show you," Sheila answered standing up suddenly and walking over to the cupboards. Mary and Jessica's eyes followed and they watched as she opened the cupboard next to the one where their clothes were securely locked out of their reach.
<br><br>
"Now," Sheila began to explain, "one of you is going to tell me exactly what happened and whilst they do the other one is going to be shut in this cupboard."
<br><br>
"Why?" Jessica interrupted in a tiny voice.
<br><br>
"Well, once I have the story from one of you, you will change places and the other will tell me what happened. This will ensure you tell the truth because if you don't..." Sheila paused for effect at this point and was able to detect a scared look in both women's eyes before continuing. "I'll superglue your hands to your backsides, put you in the lift, and send you down to the lobby."
<br><br>
Mary opened her mouth to protest but then saw the look in Sheila's eyes, thought better of it and remained silent.
<br><br>
"Now which of you is going in the cupboard first?" Sheila asked.
<br><br>
Neither women spoke, they both avoided her gaze so after a short period of silence Sheila decided for them.
<br><br>
"Mary, my girl, get in there," and pointed at the cupboard.
<br><br>
"Oh no, please," Mary begged, "I can't go in there, look, it's got shelves, there's no room."
<br><br>
"Rubbish," Sheila informed her, "you can squash in here," and pointed to the gap beneath the bottom shelf.
<br><br>
"I can't," Mary wailed
<br><br>
"You've got ten seconds or you don't get your clothes back."
<br><br>
Eight seconds later Mary was under the bottom shelf. She was curled up on her knees in a foetal position, the shelf above her pressed down on her back, it was a very cramped and uncomfortable position. Not that this bothered Sheila as she closed the cupboard door on Mary, and returned to the chair behind Peter's desk. Sitting down she looked at Jessica and said, "Lets begin."
<br><br>
"Do I have to?" Jessica pleaded, "it's not something I want to remember."
<br><br>
"Yes, you do," Sheila snapped back, "and I shall be making notes so I can type it all up for Mr Simpson later."
<br><br>
Jessica stared at her feet, she was out of her depth here and being separated from Mary made her feel even more vulnerable.
<br><br>
"Oh bother," Sheila exclaimed, "I've left my pad on my own desk, be a good girl and get it for me."
<br><br>
Jessica's eyes nearly came out on stalks,
<br><br>
"Out th.. b.. b.. but, I might be s.. seen," she stammered near to panic at the thought of having to go out of Peter's office.
<br><br>
"You know the alternative," Sheila warned her.
<br><br>
Jessica did and summoning up all her courage she went to the door of the office and opened it just enough to peek out. She could see nobody so she opened it a little bit more, still not a person in sight so she took a deep breath, opened the door wide and scurried in a crouching run to Sheila's desk. She saw the pad grabbed it and quickly hurried back into the office. Quickly closing the door she hurried over to the desk and handed Sheila her notepad.
<br><br>
"Thank you" Sheila said curtly, "now we can begin but first I'd like you to put your hands on your head."
<br><br>
Dejectedly, Jessica did so.
<br><br>
"Good girl," Sheila mocked. "Now start talking."
<br><br>
Jessica felt tears in her eyes as she stood naked with her hands on her head in front of Sheila, her colleague was shut naked in a cupboard and all their clothes were locked away. Worst of all she was powerless to do anything about it. She took a deep breath and began to recount the events of Friday night.
<br><br>
Jessica gave as much detail as she could as she recalled that Friday night and as it turned out the small hours of Saturday morning. Standing naked in the middle of an office with her hands on her head made it hard to concentrate. As she continued she began to feel a touch of anger, she had to stand there whilst Sheila sat in Peter's leather chair, fully clothed, making copious shorthand notes. Here she was being humiliated by a mere secretary and her anger nearly boiled over when she at several points in her story Sheila started laughing. It took her 20 minutes to tell Sheila all she could remember and once she had finished the secretary asked her if there was anything she had left out. Jessica thought for a moment then replied that there wasn't.
<br><br>
"Good," Sheila said, "then its time to change over," and stood up
<br><br>
"Oh please, not the cupboard," Jessica begged but Sheila just ignored her and went to the cupboard containing Mary.
<br><br>
She opened the door and said in a tone of voice that one would use on a pet dog, "Out you come then."
<br><br>
Mary needed no second invitation although it took her several seconds to extract herself from the cupboard and even longer to straighten her cramped limbs and stand up blinking as her eyes adjusted to the light. It had been horrible in there, she couldn't move and it had been dark and hot. Her incarceration had seemed like an eternity and she was just glad to be out.
<br><br>
She looked on silently as Jessica got on her hands and knees, breasts swinging beneath her and her bottom stuck up in the air as she crammed herself into the cupboard. Despite being taller than Mary she somehow squeezed herself into the small space and once in Sheila laughingly said, "Now don't go anywhere will you?" and closed the door. She immediately turned and spoke to Mary.
<br><br>
"Go and stand there," she said pointing to the middle of the office where Jessica had stood a short while earlier. Sheila herself returned to the chair and as she settled herself in once more she told Mary to put her hands on her head.
<br><br>
Mary thought about being defiant for a second but knew it would achieve nothing so she did as she was told.
<br><br>
"Thank you," Sheila began. "Now I'm sure you know the score but in case you don't I'll remind you." Mary stood naked and silent.
<br><br>
"You are going to tell me what happened and I will compare it with Jessica's account and if they don't agree then you don't get your clothes back. Understand?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Mary replied
<br><br>
"Right then, begin."
<br><br>
Mary told her version of their trip home and watched more than a little nervously as Sheila compared it with the written account in front of her. She felt just as humiliated as Jessica had done standing naked in the middle of the office as she recounted her version of events. Occasionally Sheila made a quick note on her pad that made Mary even more nervous but she eventually managed to finish. Sheila made her stand there for a minute as she closed her pad and put it on the desk. Mary couldn't bear the suspense very long and blurted out, "Was my account alright, did it match Jessica's?"
<br><br>
Sheila gave her a condescending look and just said, "I'll let you know later"
<br><br>
Mary moaned, she and Jessica would have to wait to find out their fate. Sheila smiled inwardly at the way she had the two women on tenterhooks and completely at her beck and call. She would type up their accounts, both of which did tally (but she had no intention of telling them yet), in a few minutes but she decided to have some fun with the two women who were technically her superiors whilst she did it.
<br><br>
"Get your friend out of the cupboard," she suddenly snapped at Mary who immediately went over, breasts jiggling, and opened the door.
<br><br>
"Time to come out," Sheila called from her seat behind the desk and Jessica began to extract herself. When she was finally stood up and rubbing her naked limbs Sheila began.
<br><br>
"While we are waiting for Mr Simpson to return I don't want you two standing around idly so I'd like you to get on your hands and knees and crawl round and round the office."
<br><br>
"Do what!" Mary asked in horror.
<br><br>
"You heard, crawl round the office."
<br><br>
"May I remind you that we are senior executives of this company?" Mary told Sheila in a haughty voice.
<br><br>
"That's right," Jessica, having found her voice, added in support. Sheila smiled, enjoying Jessica and Mary's small show of defiance.
<br><br>
"Well you don't look like senior executives from where I'm sitting and if you're not crawling by the time I get to the door I shall return with the superglue."
<br><br>
The naked pair hastily got on their knees and started to crawl. Sheila watched as Jessica, her breasts swinging as she crawled, followed Mary whose smaller breasts just jiggled beneath her. Both their backsides wiggled provocatively as they continued round the room and their faces burned red with the humiliation although this was hidden from Sheila by the fact that both women's hair fell down and covered their faces. Sheila watched as they completed one lap and then had a better idea.
<br><br>
"Jessica, turn round and start going the other way," she ordered. Jessica didn't look up she just did as instructed. Then standing up Sheila pressed a button on Peter's intercom and walked over to the door where she stopped and turned round.
<br><br>
"Now girls," she started, "I'm going to type up your stories, and most interesting they are too, but while I am you two will keep on crawling and each time you pass each other you will both say 'Hello, I am a naughty girl'." The naked executives both moaned audibly, Sheila was heaping humiliation upon humiliation onto them, Jessica in particular was getting close to tears. Mary was wishing it was all a bad dream and that she would wake up any minute but she knew it wasn't.
<br><br>
As they approached each other behind Peter's desk Jessica said in a wavering voice, "Hello I'm a naughty girl."
<br><br>
Then Mary repeated it, "Hello, I'm a naughty girl," in a slightly stronger voice.
<br><br>
"Excellent," Sheila laughed, "now no slacking and I've switched the intercom on so I'll be listening." And with that she went out of Peter's office, closed the door behind her and sat down at her own desk. As she opened a new file on her computer she heard, "Hello, I'm a naughty girl" twice in quick succession come out of her intercom. Smiling, she began to type.
<br><br>
"Hello, Sheila."
<br><br>
"Woah!" Sheila nearly jumped out of her skin, she had been so engrossed in her typing that she had not noticed somebody come up the corridor to her desk. She relaxed as she saw it was Teri, one of her friends and also the poor unfortunate who had the job of being secretary to both Jessica and Mary.
<br><br>
"What brings you down here?" Sheila asked making conversation as she surreptitiously switched off the intercom.
<br><br>
"Oh, my two tarts aren't in at the moment so I thought I'd have a wander round," Teri replied, "actually I thought they came to see your boss. Is he in?"
<br><br>
"No, gone to a board meeting."
<br><br>
"That's odd, wonder what happened to my pair?"
<br><br>
Sheila did not reply for a minute, she was deep in thought as to whether she should tell Teri or not. Teri deserved it she decided, after all she had to put up with Jessica and Mary all the time.
<br><br>
She took a deep breath and said, "They are still in there, Teri. Peter made them take off their clothes and then he locked them away before he went to the board meeting."
<br><br>
"Ho, ho, very funny," Teri retorted at what she thought was a joke.
<br><br>
"Right now they are crawling round Peter's office stark naked." Sheila persisted and switched the intercom back on. "Listen."
<br><br>
"If they're doing what you say I'll crawl round this whole building stark n-."
<br><br>
"Hello, I'm a naughty girl," came from the intercom.
<br><br>
"What was that?" Teri asked in amazement.
<br><br>
"Exactly what I said," Sheila answered and briefly explained the scenario.
<br><br>
Teri just looked at her in astonishment then once it had sunk in she regained her wits and said,
<br><br>
"Let me see."
<br><br>
"Are you sure?" Sheila asked
<br><br>
"Too right I am," Teri immediately replied. "I never thought I'd see the day when those two bitches got their comeuppance."
<br><br>
"Bitches," Sheila thought to herself, "that reminds me, one of them called me a bitch earlier." Then she stood up and said out loud to Teri, "Come on then, let me show you."
<br><br>
Both Jessica and Mary's knees and arms were aching like mad. They did not know how long they had been crawling and they felt even more ridiculous each time they passed each other and uttered the phrase Sheila had ordered them too. They weren't sure if she was outside listening but dared not take the chance; there was nothing else to do if they stood a chance of regaining their clothing. As Jessica approached the door it opened in front of her, she didn't look up, as a pair of feet which she recognized as Sheila's enter, but a second later she let out a shriek as a second pair came into her field of vision. Wildly she looked up and her blood froze as she saw that they belonged to Teri. From the other side of the room an "O, Jesus" was heard as Mary recognized the new arrival.
<br><br>
"Don't let her see us like this," Jessica begged Sheila, tears in her eyes.
<br><br>
"A bit late isn't it?" Teri answered, "and by the look of it I don't think you are in any position to make demands."
<br><br>
Jessica hung her head, she was too embarrassed to look at Teri, it was just too humiliating for her being naked in front of her secretary. Matters were made worse by the fact that the petite dark haired Teri was only just turned 20.
<br><br>
"I didn't tell you to stop," Sheila reminded Jessica. "Keep crawling."
<br><br>
Jessica <br><br>sobbed and began to crawl again and when she met up with Mary once again they both repeated, "Hello I am a naughty girl" at which Teri burst out laughing.
<br><br>
"I never thought I'd see this," she said to Sheila and then added in a quieter voice, "will they really do whatever you say?"
<br><br>
"O yes, <br><br>they have no choice," Sheila assured her, "and they'll do what you want as well."

"Oh right," Teri<br><br>'s eyes lit up. "In that case, Jessica, Mary, get your sorry arses over here." And pointed to the floor in front of her. The two embarrassed executives crawled over and remained on all fours in front of her, neither could bring herself to look up at Teri.

"Well, well, well," Teri<br><br> mocked folding her arms and looking down at her bosses, "I never thought I would see the day when the high and mighty Jessica Yates and Mary Bennett were grovelling at my feet, and naked as well. I bet you're wishing you'd been nicer to me now?"
<br><br>
Neither of them responded so Teri continued,
<br><br>
"So as a small measure of atonement for all the times you have treated me like shit you can kiss my feet and apologize."
<br><br>
Both women looked aghast at Teri's latest idea but before anybody could do or say anything more the door to the office opened and they all looked round as Peter walked in. He glanced round and immediately got the measure of the situation.
<br><br>
"Hello Teri," he said without batting an eyelid, "Having fun?"
<br><br>
"You could say that," Teri replied smiling.
<br><br>
"Well don't let me interrupt," Peter added as he put his briefcase on his desk and then went round behind his desk and sat down. Teri turned her attention back to the kneeling women.
<br><br>
"Get on with it," she ordered, "one foot each."
<br><br>
Mary slowly bent forward and pressed her lips to Teri's left foot, Jessica followed her lead and did the same to her right foot. Both of them felt utterly humiliated but knew there was nothing they could do about it.
<br><br>
"Excellent" Teri told them, looking down at them, " Now apologize."
<br><br>
"Sorry," Jessica mumbled, lifting her head slightly.
<br><br>
"Sorry," Mary was heard to say only marginally louder.
<br><br>
"Sorry for what?" Teri asked sharply, enjoying every moment of her boss's embarrassment.
<br><br>
"Sorry for treating you badly," Mary mumbled.
<br><br>
"Louder," Teri ordered.
<br><br>
"Sorry for treating you badly," Mary repeated in a louder voice.
<br><br>
"Now your turn Jessica." Teri addressed the redhead.
<br><br>
Whilst Teri kept Mary and Jessica occupied Peter spoke to Sheila.
<br><br>
"You got their stories then?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Oh yes," Sheila grinned, "you'll enjoy reading them. I'll go and finish typing them up now if you like."
<br><br>
"No, it can wait," Peter replied, "how about if I take you and Teri out for lunch."
<br><br>
"Sounds good to me," Sheila responded, "but what about these two?" waving her arm in the direction of Mary and Jessica.
<br><br>
"Oh stick them in a cupboard," Peter answered offhandedly and was then somewhat bemused as Sheila burst out laughing. She quickly explained what she had done earlier at which point Peter started laughing as well. They had a brief discussion and decided that they couldn't get them both into the cupboard that Sheila had used so settled on using the one where Peter hung his coat. They reckoned that they could squeeze both women in standing up. Sheila went to inspect the cupboard whilst Peter ordered the women to their feet. As they stood up he once again admired their bodies but was interrupted when Sheila called them both over to the cupboard. Neither of the unclothed pair said anything as they went over to Sheila, they knew with a sinking feeling what was going to happen.
<br><br>
"You should both fit in," Sheila told them, "although its a good job you're close friends."
<br><br>
Sheila, Teri and Peter watched as the two women forced themselves into the cupboard. They succeeded without too much trouble and stood, facing each other their breasts squashed together and faces millimetres apart, not really knowing where to put their hands, afraid to touch each others naked flesh.
<br><br>
"Have fun," Sheila said and then closed the door plunging them into darkness. The three of them then headed out of the office.
<br><br>
Several hours later Peter and Sheila returned; it had been a very long lunch. Teri had left them as they came out of the lift and returned to her own desk to check up on various things. Peter went to his desk and Sheila sat at hers and began to finish off typing up her notes of Jessica and Mary's exploits. Inside the cupboard the occupants heard their return and listened in anticipation as they expected to be released any moment. Their hopes were soon dashed as everything quietened down again.
<br><br>
"I can't stand much more of this," Jessica whispered in a small voice.
<br><br>
"We have to," Mary whispered back. It was hot in the cupboard after nearly five hours and both their bodies were by now quite slippery with sweat, Mary could feel her hair plastered to her scalp and knew her make up must have run all over her face, she knew Jessica would be in exactly the same state. Every time Jessica breathed, both women had been panting for some time due to the heat, Mary felt her hot breath on her face, and as Jessica's chest heaved it caused her breasts to rub against Mary's. Their hands however remained firmly by their sides, neither women wanted to touch the other, they just wanted to be let out. There was silence in the cupboard apart from the sound of breathing as they strained their ears to listen for any noise outside that might signal the end of their imprisonment.
<br><br>
Sheila quietly wandered into Peter's office and waved a wad of papers at him, Peter looked up and silently mouthed, "Finished?"
<br><br>
Sheila nodded in answer, neither wanted the two in the cupboard to hear. Peter smiled and rose from his chair without making a noise and then as quietly as he could headed over to the cupboard. He grasped the handle, paused and then suddenly wrenched it open.
<br><br>
"Wake up!" he shouted causing both Jessica and Mary to let out a scream.
<br><br>
"Out you come," Peter ordered and then stood back to watch as they slowly and stiffly extricated themselves. Teri came into the office just in time to see the naked women get out of the cupboard. Simultaneously she and Sheila burst out laughing at the state of Mary and Jessica. When the two executives had arrived in the office that morning they had been immaculately dressed, now they had been systematically reduced to two naked sweat covered wretches. Their expensive hair styles had long since ceased to exist and instead they were left with bedraggled hair that was stuck to their heads and down their backs. Their eyeliner had run down their cheeks and their lipstick was all around their mouths and this coupled with the way they stiffly moved after so long a confinement and the fact they could hardly see due to their eyes not being used to the light meant they gave an accurate portrayal of two utterly defeated women.
<br><br>
Peter returned to his desk as they stood their blinking and Sheila handed him a pile of papers which he separated into two heaps. These were the accounts of Jessica and Mary. Or at least that was what they were meant to look like. In truth both their accounts had been identical so Sheila had just typed up one, and then printed it twice!
<br><br>
Peter pretended to compare the two reports and as Mary and Jessica's eyes became accustomed to the light they saw what he was doing and began to worry. Peter didn't keep them in suspense for long, he suddenly looked up,
<br><br>
"These are pathetic," he said in an angry voice, "they don't agree at all" and picked up one pile of papers and waved it in the air.
<br><br>
"No," Mary gasped
<br><br>
Jessica just stood there dumbstruck.
<br><br>
"I've had enough of you both for today," he continued, " so I'll leave it to Sheila to deal with you." Then looking towards Sheila he said, " Get them out of my sight."
<br><br>
"Certainly," Sheila replied and marched over to a speechless Mary and grabbed her by the upper arm. Teri needed no encouragement and did the same to Jessica who was equally lost for words, and before the naked executives knew what was happening they had been bundled out of Peter's office. Sheila picked something off her desk as they went by and then frog-marched Mary down the corridor towards the lift, Teri and Jessica followed close behind.
<br><br>
The whole building was by now virtually empty as it was well past the normal finishing time for most of the workers but Mary and Jessica had lost all track of time and did not know this. As the realization of what was happening to them sunk in they began to look around desperately, on the verge of panic, to see if anybody was watching them. All four stopped in front of the lift and Teri pressed the call button and whilst they waited both naked women pleaded to be let go of and given some clothes. But their pleas were ignored, Sheila and Teri remained silent retaining a firm grip on the arms of their respective charges. Their hearts nearly stopped as the lift arrived and the doors slid open but there was nobody in it and they breathed out in relief. They were led in and taken up two floors and when the lift doors opened again Jessica and Mary could see that they were on the way to their own offices. As they were led down the familiar corridor it felt deeply embarrassing to be heading towards their own offices under these circumstances. Normally they would be wearing a business suit and carrying an aurora of power, maybe stopping off en route to give instructions to some fearful subordinate. Now, however, they were naked, bedraggled and could feel carpet beneath their bare feet as they were led, dejectedly, by a couple of secretaries towards their offices. Fortunately for them the place was deserted and shortly they found themselves in Mary's office. Teri released Jessica's arm and closed the door behind them. Sheila wasted no time and sat in Mary's chair and then immediately addressed the cringing women, they knew something unpleasant was going to happen to them.
<br><br>
"So your stories didn't tally."
<br><br>
"We're sorry, give us another chance," Jessica begged.
<br><br>
"Yes, please," Mary added in a piteous voice.
<br><br>
"You've had your chance," Sheila replied icily, "You should have got your stories straight."
<br><br>
"But we did," both women whined.
<br><br>
"Rubbish," Sheila snorted and then added, " I take it you remember what I told you I'd do if your stories didn't agree."
<br><br>
Mary and Jessica looked blank
<br><br>
"Well let me remind you," Sheila told them after a lengthy pause and produced a tube of superglue, she had remembered in the nick of time to pick it up off her desk as they had passed. The effect on the two executives was electric.
<br><br>
Jessica's hand flew to her mouth in horror whilst Mary cried out, "Oh god!"
<br><br>
"Surely" they both thought she wouldn't really carry out her threat to glue their hands to their backsides and them put them in the lift. But they watched in mute fascination as Sheila slowly removed the cap.
<br><br>
"Who's first?" she looked up smiling.
<br><br>
"No, you can't," Mary pleaded and started backing towards the door, Jessica still with her hand to her mouth stood rooted to the spot. Mary felt Teri grab her arm and start to propel her towards the desk, Mary began to struggle but Teri despite her smaller stature was much stronger, and had no difficulty in controlling her. Mary felt herself bent face down over her own desk with Teri holding her down by her neck. Sheila rapidly came round to the same side and squirted several blobs of glue on Mary's right buttock and without pausing grabbed her right arm and with a brief struggle pressed the palm of Mary's hand onto the glue. She then pressed with all her might for a good thirty seconds before releasing the pressure.
<br><br>
"Nooooo," Mary cried as she tried to detach her right hand from her backside and failed., the glue had done its trick. The performance was repeated with the left side of Mary and this time after thirty seconds she was released by both Sheila and Teri and helped to a standing position. Mary tugged so hard that she was staggering round the office as she kept losing her balance but her hands were firmly glued and once she realized this she stood still and burst into tears. Sheila and Teri laughed at her but this was cut short when Jessica who had not moved through the whole episode of gluing Mary's hands suddenly came to her senses and made a bolt for the door. She had the door half open when Teri, who had shot across the office to intercept her, crashed into her back forcing her up against the door and closing it at the same time. Teri grabbed her hair and held her head sideways to the door at which point Sheila arrived and went to work with the glue. In less than two minutes Jessica was in the same predicament as Mary, and also crying.
<br><br>
"Shut up and listen," Sheila called out and both women managed to control their tears and stood there sniffing.
<br><br>
"Good," Sheila said once she had their attention and then continued. "Teri and I are going now." Both the naked women groaned at this. Sheila went on, "but we will wait 20 minutes in the car park for you, if you don't make it by then... well, I'll leave that to your imaginations."
<br><br>
Mary and Jessica glanced at each other and Mary was opening her mouth to say something only to hear her office door close as the secretaries departed.
<br><br>
"Oh shit!" she wailed..
<br><br>
Two floors below Peter finished what he was doing and picked up one of the copies of the two women's account. He settled back in his chair and with a smile on his face began to read......<br><br><br><br></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 22pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Executive Stress - Part 3</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"What do we do now?" Jessica sobbed and looked at Mary with tears running down her cheeks
<br><br>
"We've just got to get to that car park or we've had it," Mary replied, she was in tears as well but was managing to think rationally.
<br><br>
"But we don't stand a chance like this," Jessica said between sniffles, "and what if we are seen."
<br><br>
Mary had to concede that she had a point. They had been told they had twenty minutes to get themselves down to the ground floor and out into the car park. Under normal circumstances this would have been easily accomplished but unfortunately for Mary and Jessica they were going to have to attempt this completely naked with their hands superglued to their backsides.
<br><br>
"You got a better idea?" Mary asked Jessica mournfully.
<br><br>
"Er, no," was all the reply Jessica could come up with.
<br><br>
"Well, we have to go for it because if we stay here we're bound to be discovered, sooner or later," Mary decided for both of them.
<br><br>
"I suppose you're right," Jessica agreed and summoning up her reserves of courage added, "Lets go for it then."
<br><br>
With that both women, hands stuck to backsides, headed for the door and then promptly stopped again, their eyes glued on the shiny brass round door handle. Getting out of the office was going to be their first problem and they both rapidly realized how helpless one was without the use of ones hands. After a moment Jessica turned round and backed up to the door, she then crouched down until the door handle was wedged in her left armpit. Then by pivoting her upper body and gripping like mad she tried to turn the handle. She got it to move but not far enough, taking another grip and with pain showing in her face she tried again.
<br><br>
"Go on," Mary cried in encouragement and to her joy Jessica succeeded and as the door swung open the redhead collapsed in a heap on the ground.
<br><br>
"Ouch," she cried as she hit the floor.
<br><br>
"Well done," Mary congratulated her and moved forward to help her colleague but upon realising she couldn't, instead stood and watched as Jessica struggled to regain her feet.
<br><br>
Once back upright Jessica hissed, "Lets go then," and led the way through the deserted offices.
<br><br>
It was bad enough when they had been led towards their offices by Teri and Sheila but going the other way alone and helpless was even worse. If there had been anyone watching, the two women would have been quite a sight. Neither could cover themselves and in a vain attempt at modesty they both scurried along the corridor in a sort of crouch. Jessica, in the lead, displayed the fact that she really was a redhead, her exposed breasts swung in time to her run. The less well endowed Mary had breasts that could be best described as jiggling as she followed Jessica. As soon as they got to the lift Jessica dropped to her knees and hit the call button with her forehead, somewhere high above the lift motors burst into life. Unfortunately for them due to modern technology, many floors below, they were spotted ! Brian Stevens, the night security man, was gazing idly at his bank of monitors when a movement on one of the screens caught his eye. His eyes came out on stalks as he took a closer look and then he quickly punched some buttons on his key board and the image he was interested in came up on the screen on the desk in front of him.
<br><br>
"I'm not dreaming," he thought to himself, "I am looking at two naked women."
<br><br>
Brian, an ex-policeman, although in his late fifties, was still extremely quick witted and in a short time he had zoomed in on the two women and as they waited nervously he recognized them. "Jessica Yates and Mary Bennett," he said out loud and then laughed. Like most of the people in the office he knew them as a stuck up pair of cows and in his case, being a mere Security guard, they didn't even acknowledge his presence. He also knew quite a few people who had fallen foul of them and come off second best. Chuckling, he concluded that somebody had finally decided it was time they got their comeuppance, this was backed up by the fact that they appeared to have their hands glued to their bottoms. He resolved to have a bit of fun himself.
<br><br>
While Mary and Jessica were kept occupied elsewhere in the building Peter Simpson sat reclined in his chair reading their accounts of the previous Friday night when he had arranged to have them left stark naked on a train. Sheila had done an excellent job of typing up their story and he almost immediately became totally absorbed in it.
<br><br>
Both women were on the verge of panic as their train sped through the night, they had been blackmailed into stripping naked and then had watched in horror as their clothes and all their personal possessions were ejected from the window. Once the anonymous man had left the train they both cried at the situation they were in but were brought back to reality as the train rolled into the next station. They both squashed down in their seats and Mary put her arms across her breasts and crossed her legs in an attempt to hide herself. Jessica drew her knees up under her chin and covered herself like that. But fortunately for them, nobody got into their compartment and they relaxed slightly as the train set off once again. Mary by now was thinking reasonably straight and this rubbed off on Jessica who calmed down to some extent as well and they began to discuss the best way out of their predicament. Things were made worse by the fact that they had lost not only their clothes but also their handbags containing all their money credit cards and most importantly keys. They were in effect stranded naked and penniless on a train and unable to gain entry to their homes assuming they could get there at all. When they had left the office their plan was to go to Jessica's house to finish off their report, now however they had a lot more to worry about. After careful deliberation which was interrupted by another heart stopping halt at a station they devised a plan of sorts. They would travel to the station beyond the one that Jessica normally got off at and then head back to her house from there. This they reckoned would be their best option as to get to Mary's house would have entailed going right to the end of the line, to a busy station, and then a 5 mile walk part of which was through a town centre. Jessica's normal station was quite busy which was why they agreed to go one stop further to a station that whilst being further from her house, about 3 miles further, was much quieter and therefore there was less chance of being spotted. Plan devised, they sat there in silence, both lost in their own thoughts with mental images of what might befall them constantly flashing through their minds which did nothing to lessen their apprehension. They had to endure two more stops one of which was at the station that Jessica normally got off at, but on both occasions they were undisturbed.
<br><br>
But their hearts really began to pound as they got closer to the station where they knew they would have to get off, the train started to slow and their mouths went dry. They both knew that this was where things would start to get very difficult and as the train came to a stand they nervously glanced at each other. Mary nodded in the direction of the door and they stood up and moved across to the door. Looking out Mary quickly assessed the situation, and knowing that time was not on their side, made a decision. As predicted the station was quiet with only a handful of passengers alighting and heading for the exit, also being a more rural station it had a nicely tended flower bed and for the first time that evening the women's luck was in as they had stopped opposite a large rhododendron bush.
<br><br>
Mary turned the door handle but held the door closed, she waited as long as she dared for the platform to clear before whispering to Jessica who was standing behind her, "Follow me to the bush" and without waiting for a reply swung the door open and made a dash across the platform and the relative safety of the rhododendron. Jessica who was hard on her heels had the sense to slam the train door shut behind her, but then disaster, as the door closed she swung round to follow Mary only to trip headlong over her, Mary for some reason was lying on the ground. As Jessica picked herself up her blood froze as she saw that the naked Mary was lying on top of a dark suited business man!.
<br><br>
"O shit," she said out loud as she regained her feet and made a dive for the bush, Mary was not far behind her and before the poor fellow on the platform knew what had happened they both disappeared behind the bush just as the train accelerated out of the station.
<br><br>
The chap who had consumed a few drinks before catching his train rather slowly sat up and looked around, "Was I really knocked over by a naked woman?" he thought to himself, still looking round. But he could see nothing and picking himself up he resolved to cut down on his drinking before trudging towards the exit and the ticket collector. Behind the bush however crouched two naked business women who couldn't believe that they had just got away without being discovered. Taking a couple of minutes to compose themselves, or at least as best they could when hiding naked behind a bush, and also to make sure the platform was absolutely clear they debated how to get out of the station. Surveying the platform from their hiding place it soon became apparent that due to a high fence the only way out was via the main exit which was manned by a ticket collector.
<br><br>
"How do we get past him," Jennifer enquired when it was clear there was no other way out.
<br><br>
"We run as fast as we can and keep on running," Mary replied.
<br><br>
But we might be seen," said Jessica in a startled voice.
<br><br>
"Damn right we will," Mary snapped back, "but as long as we are not caught we should be OK."
<br><br>
The thought of being caught, naked in her home town filled Jessica with dread but she couldn't dwell on it long as Mary asked, "Are you ready?"
<br><br>
"Well I..."
<br><br>
"It's now or never," Mary cut her off and without waiting for a reply dashed out from her hiding place. Jessica didn't bother thinking but on impulse immediately followed her. They both set off hands over breasts and pussies but, almost together, realized that speed would be preferable to modesty and taking their hands away sprinted for the exit. They were going flat out when they reached the exit and were past the ticket collector and onto the station forecourt before they realized it. The ticket collector was standing open mouthed not able to believe his eyes, had he really seen two naked women dash past him? By the time he had regained his wits they had disappeared into the night.
<br><br>
There were few people in the station and only one actually saw them as they flashed through. The man in question stared in amazement as Jessica and Mary passed him.
<br><br>
"At least I'm on my feet this time," he muttered to himself, and once again resolved to cut down on his drinking.
<br><br>
Out of the station they crossed the empty taxi rank and then Mary slowed, unsure of her surroundings. Jessica took the lead red hair streaming out behind her.
<br><br>
"Follow me," she called over her shoulder. Mary needed no encouragement and did so. Jessica then led them down the footpath of what was a busy road away from the station, if any passing motorists saw them, which was highly likely, they probably wouldn't have believed their eyes. After 150 yards she dodged to her right into a dark side alley and stopped. Mary followed her and hiding in the shadows they both gasped for air as they recovered their breath.
<br><br>
"What now?" Mary asked when her breathing had slowed enough to speak.
<br><br>
"Its about three miles from here," Jessica responded between gasps, clearly she was the less fit of the two. "If we go down this alley it leads to the canal and we can follow the towpath to within about half a mile of my house."
<br><br>
"Then what?" Mary asked
<br><br>
"You don't want to know," Jessica replied grimly then added, "Come on, let's get on," and led them down the alley.
<br><br>
It was very dark and now that there was less chance of being caught and they were no longer on smooth tarmac they soon became acutely aware of their bare feet as they groped their way down the alley to the canal. By the time they got to the canal they were hobbling , both had caught their toes on stones and to make matters worse they began to notice the cold. For a clothed person it would have been a cool evening but in their state it was definitely considerably worse.
<br><br>
Jessica turned left and trudged along the towpath, Mary followed silently behind. They were heading back towards the town centre. As Jessica lived on its edge, by alighting at the station they had done they would not actually have to go through the centre to get to her house. As they walked on, passing under the occasional bridge, matters were made slightly better by the emergence of the moon. This meant that they could at least see reasonably well where they were going; it also highlighted the fact that they had high walls and buildings on one side and only the canal on the other, there was nowhere to hide. They were making good progress when they approached another bridge where the canal passed under a road. At these points the canal narrowed to pass through the arch of the bridge and the towpath also dipped down nearer to the water level to squeeze through as well. With things going as well as could be expected under the circumstances neither women were exercising the caution they had done previously so it came as a great shock when coming out from under the bridge Jessica bumped into a man and a woman walking arm in arm towards them.
<br><br>
"Ow," the man cried as Jessica collided with him. Mary managed to stop but then the other women switched on a torch and the two naked executives froze, caught like deer startled by car headlights. Nobody moved or said anything for what seemed like an eternity and it was finally the clothed women who spoke first.
<br><br>
"How disgusting," she told them angrily, "you should be ashamed of yourselves. I suppose this is some silly prank"
<br><br>
"No, er, actually.." Mary began but the woman cut her off by saying to her partner, "George, call the police."
<br><br>
The man then produced a mobile phone and began to dial. Mary decided that the time for explanations was over and shouting, "RUN!" took off down the towpath; Jessica was right behind her.
<br><br>
"What do we do now?" Jennifer called out to Mary as they sprinted down the side of the canal.
<br><br>
"Get away from her as fast as possible," came the reply.
<br><br>
They passed under one bridge and without slowing carried on down the towpath. They went round a bend in the canal and were about 150 yards away from the next bridge when Mary suddenly stopped and Jessica crashed into the back of her.
<br><br>
"What the hell!" Jessica cried angrily.
<br><br>
"Look!" Mary told her and pointed to the bridge upon which a car had just stopped. A car with blue flashing lights on its roof, a police car!
<br><br>
"O shit," Jessica said on the edge of panic, they would never live it down if they were caught like this. As they stood there they saw the torches of the police come down the steps from the road and onto the towpath. They couldn't go back because of the couple who had reported them and there was a large factory on the canal side with no doors or windows. Again Mary made a decision for both of them,
<br><br>
"Into the canal," she hissed
<br><br>
"Get lost," Jessica replied incredulously
<br><br>
"We've no choice," Mary told her, crouching down ready to lower herself over the side of the towpath. "If we keep close to the side and hide behind these reeds they may not see us."
<br><br>
Jessica was undecided but another glance at the approaching lights was enough to convince her. As she got onto her knees Mary was already slipping into the murky water so Jessica followed her and it took all her self control to stop herself crying out as the cold water rose up her body. The canal was heavily silted up and as they pressed as close to the bank as they did so they felt thick mud pressing against their bodies. The torches came closer and they both lowered themselves until their chins were at water level., they hardly dared breath and had to concentrate to stop their teeth chattering. A torch beam swung across the top of their heads and they both stopped breathing for several seconds and involuntarily closed their eyes.
<br><br>
When they dared to open them again the beams had gone and Mary lifted her head up just enough to get a peek along the towpath, she was glad to see the torches receding into the distance. They stayed in the water, teeth chattering uncontrollably, until they saw the police car drive off. Getting out proved to be interesting, as it proved quite an effort for them to break the suction between their bodies and the thick mud they had been lying on beneath the waters surface. They succeeded, with a bit of a struggle, and hauled their mud covered bodies onto the towpath and then without a word set off once more on their way, Jessica leading once more. The rest of their trip alongside the canal passed without incident and soon they found themselves stood at the point where Jessica informed Mary that they would have to leave the canal for the final half mile to her house.
<br><br>
"This is the bit you told me not to ask about," Mary said as they cautiously climbed some steps from the towpath up to a road. "Why is that?"
<br><br>
"Take a look for yourself," Jessica replied as they reached the top and carefully peeked round the corner of a building.
<br><br>
"Oh my god," Mary groaned. She found herself looking at rather busy supermarket car park, Friday was late night shopping for a lot of people.
<br><br>
"We don't have to go across there, do we?" Mary asked, looking nervously at the size of the car park and the number of people there were in it.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid we do," Jessica answered.
<br><br>
"There must be another way," Mary said still looking in horror.
<br><br>
"No there isn't," Jessica informed her, "my house is over there, " and she waved her arm in the vague direction of some houses at the other side of the supermarket.
<br><br>
"We'll just have to wait" Mary said emphatically, "until the supermarket closes."
<br><br>
"OK," Jessica agreed and both women slipped back down he steps to wait in the shadows.
<br><br>
Ten minutes later, following their dip in the canal, they started to get cold and shiver. By twenty minutes they were virtually frozen to the spot.
<br><br>
"It's ages till the supermarket closes," Jessica said through chattering teeth, "we'll freeze to death if we stop here."
<br><br>
"Well I'm not going out there yet," Mary replied between shivers, but Jessica had had enough, she could stand the cold no longer and started to climb the steps.
<br><br>
"I'm going to make a run for it, you can come or stay here," she said as she reached the top of the steps.
<br><br>
""Jessica, come back!" Mary cried but instead Jessica glanced at the traffic on the road in front of the supermarket and on seeing a gap ran across it in the direction of the car park.
<br><br>
"NOOOO," Mary howled in despair as Jessica disappeared from her view but she was following as she knew being left on her own would be even worse than the naked run to Jessica's house. Mary started to cross the road as Jessica ran through a flowerbed on the other side and entered the car park . There was a cacophony of vehicle horns as motorists saw not one but two naked women flash in front of them. Traffic came to almost a standstill as the two's progress was tracked across the supermarket car park. Mary tried to shut out what was happening around her, instead she concentrated on Jessica's naked form sprinting along about 20 yards in front of her, she was however strangely conscious of the sound of her naked feet slapping on the tarmac. She wished it was all a bad dream and that she would wake up in a minute but she knew she wouldn't. Jessica was more aware of her surroundings as she sped past people unloading shopping into their car boots or returning trolleys. Surprisingly a lot of them never noticed the naked pair pass them, but there were those who definitely did. One teenage boy taking a trolley back for his mother was glad he had been made to help with the shopping that night, he got a good look at both women and stood in amazement as they receded into the distance. A man pushing a trolley back to his car stood in amazement as he saw the two approach and his eyes followed them as they passed him. He only came to his senses when his wife gave him a sharp dig in the ribs. It must have been no more than ninety seconds before the women left the car park and went round the end of the supermarket itself. They crossed the completely empty lorry loading bays without a break in their pace but were breathing very heavily as lungs gasped for air and exited the supermarket premises directly opposite Jessica's street. They shot across another road without looking causing a car to screech to a halt, Jessica didn't see but Mary was acutely aware of the look of amazement and then one of disgust on the woman driver's face. She hoped it was nobody who lived near Jessica.
<br><br>
The redhead then led them down the street which luckily was empty and with a feeling of relief turned into her own driveway and came to a halt, Mary was not far behind. Both women then bent over at the waist trying to regain their breath, although Jessica had the sense to lead them both down the side of the house out of sight of any nosy neighbours.
<br><br>
"How do we get in?" Mary, who recovered first, asked as they hid, shivering in the shadows at the side of Jessica's house.
<br><br>
"Round the back," Jessica replied through chattering teeth and started to lead the way. Once she reached the back door she stopped and turned to see if Mary was following.
<br><br>
Mary was and enquired, "Have you got a key?"
<br><br>
Jessica did not reply, she tried the door handle just in case but as expected it was locked so instead she stepped back, picked up a large rock from the edge of the garden and without hesitating hurled it through the pane of glass in the top half of her kitchen door. The glass shattered and very carefully, so as not to cut her feet, Jessica went back and reaching in unlocked her back door and went inside. Mary didn't wait to be invited and equally carefully stepped into the darkened kitchen. As she did so, from somewhere else in the house she heard Jessica punch in the code to disable her alarm before it went off. Mary went through into the hall and then suddenly found herself blinded as Jessica flicked on the light. It took several minutes for the two women's eyes to adjust to the sudden brightness and went they finally did they stood looking at each other in astonishment. Following their dip in the canal they were both plastered in a thick black oily mud which by now was caking itself to their bodies. In addition they had a green slime also from the canal in their hair and on their shoulders, the few remaining traces of makeup was smeared around their faces. It would have been difficult for anybody to recognize them as the smart, self confident executives that had set off to work that morning.
<br><br>
"Bath time," Jessica announced and went up the stairs, Mary followed.
<br><br>
The rest of the weekend was spent cleaning themselves, and then the house where they had trailed mud. They in addition got the back door repaired had new locks fitted, bathed their sore feet and organized replacement credit cards. They also found plenty of time to see if they could find a way out of the mess they were in but came to the inevitable conclusion that all they could do was show up at peter Simpson's office on Monday morning as instructed. They resigned themselves to their fate by Sunday lunch time so Mary departed for her own house, wearing borrowed clothes, having arranged to meet a locksmith there! Neither of them wanted to contemplate what Peter had in store for them.
<br><br>
Peter smiled as he put down the accounts, he then decided he'd better get on and do some of the work he was paid to do and was soon engrossed in it.
<br><br>
Jessica and Mary waited what seemed like an eternity for the lift to arrive. All the while they were constantly looking up and down the various corridors that met at the lift in fear of being seen, neither of them had the faintest idea they were being watched via a security camera. At last the lift arrived and the doors slid open, quick as a flash the naked pair hurried inside and Mary located the button for the basement and after several seconds of trying managed to press it with her head. The doors closed immediately and the lift headed for the basement car park. A feeling of relief passed over them as they watched the numbers above the door indicate the steady descent of the lift. They smiled nervously at each other in an attempt at mutual reassurance but then the lift ground to a halt on the second floor. Their feelings of relief instantly vanished to be replaced by one of extreme trepidation. Had somebody pressed the button on the second floor? They squashed themselves against opposite sides of the lift and waited in dread for the door to open. A minute later they looked at each other quizzically as the door had failed to open, both were aware that the lift did not normally behave like this. Nervously, and still in silence, Jessica gingerly made her way over to the control panel and used her head to press the basement button,. The lift remained motionless so she tried again this time with a little more force, still nothing and finally in frustration she banged the panel with her head The thought of being stuck in a lift in their current predicament was something neither woman dared even contemplate.
<br><br>
Two floors below them Brian picked up a bunch of keys and headed for the second floor via the stairs. For some reason best known to themselves the designers of the building had thought it necessary to incorporate a facility whereby all the lifts could be overridden and operated from the security console. Brian had played with this before to amuse himself at night but had never come up with a practical use for this lift control, until tonight! He took his time and trudged up the two flights of stairs knowing that the occupants of the lift would be getting more worried by the minute. On reaching the second floor he went through the door from the stairwell and turning left arrived outside the lift. He wasted no time and selecting a key from the bunch he had brought with him inserted it into a slot just below the "Call lift" button. The door slid open and he was confronted with a full frontal sight of the two naked executives staring back at him. Nothing happened for several seconds and then Jessica screamed, spun round and desperately pushed herself into a corner of the lift. Mary then did the same in the opposite corner.
<br><br>
Brian laughed and said, "Good evening."
<br><br>
"Go away," Mary squealed going red with embarrassment at being caught naked like this.
<br><br>
"Why don't you come out of the lift?" Brian asked ignoring Mary's comment.
<br><br>
"Piss off and leave us pervert," Jessica called out from her corner attempting to put on a show of bravado.
<br><br>
Brian looked at the pair squirming in opposite corners trying to hide their nakedness from him and then said, "If I go, I shut the lift door and as I've isolated the controls you'll still be in there tomorrow morning."
<br><br>
Silence greeted him so he went on.
<br><br>
"The choice is yours, Ms Yates and Ms Bennett."
<br><br>
The fact that he knew who they were startled Jessica and Mary and removed any further thoughts of resistance, slowly they turned and faces burning red exited the lift and stood staring at their feet in front of the security guard.
<br><br>
"What exactly are you two doing?" Brian asked.
<br><br>
"We're trying to get to the basement car park," Mary mumbled in reply.
<br><br>
"So why are you in this condition?" Brian queried
<br><br>
"Er, we lost a bet," Mary hastily told him not wanting the security guard to know the truth.
<br><br>
Brian, being an ex-policeman, knew she was lying but didn't press the matter; instead he came straight to his point.
<br><br>
"Do you remember George Hallett?" he asked.
<br><br>
Neither Jessica nor Mary looked up; they just shook their heads and Mary muttered, "No."
<br><br>
"I didn't think you would," Brian continued, "he was a friend of mine and you lost him his job."
<br><br>
No response from the women as Brian paused for effect and admired their bodies before carrying on.
<br><br>
"So now I'm going to get even for him." A slight sigh greeted this last comment but Brian then shocked them both by asking, "Are you two lesbians?"
<br><br>
"NO!" came an outraged reply in unison from Jessica and Mary.
<br><br>
"Good," Brian said more to himself than anybody else and then directed Mary to sit on a receptionist chair that he dragged out from behind a desk for the purpose. Mary sat there as instructed, knees pressed together as Brian called Jessica over. Both were mystified but remained silent.
<br><br>
"Kneel down in front of your friend here," he ordered and as she came over he placed a hand under her left armpit to help her down. Once he had both women in position he explained what he wanted.
<br><br>
"Ms Yates," he started, "I'd like you to demonstrate oral sex on Ms Bennett."
<br><br>
Jessica recoiled in horror nearly falling over backwards in the process and Mary nearly fell off the chair.
<br><br>
"You've got to be joking," she said in a shocked voice.
<br><br>
Brian eyed them both and then spoke.
<br><br>
"I'll give you a choice," he said, "Ms Yates here can get her pretty little face between your legs in the next minute, or alternatively you both go back in that lift until you are found tomorrow, its up to you."
<br><br>
Mary looked down at Jessica kneeling before her, she saw the look of defeat in her colleague's eyes and without a word she slowly spread her legs. She watched almost as if in a trance as Jessica, a look of revulsion on her face, ever so slowly shuffled forward a few inches on her knees before even more slowly leaning forward to get her head between Mary's legs. At this point Mary tore her eyes away from Jessica and throwing her head back fixed her eyes on the ceiling directly above her head. Jessica paused when her mouth was about 2 inches away from Mary's pussy, this was as close as she had ever been to another women and she had no desire to be there. The redhead was about to back away when she considered the alternative of being left in the lift and it also occurred to her that time was running out for them to get to the car park. Taking a breath she lent forward and pressed her lips against Jessica's pubic hair, feeling an involuntary twitch and a sharp intake of breath from Mary, as she did so, she could also feel the heat from her face as it burned red with humiliation.
<br><br>
"Lick," she heard the guard order her and so she gingerly slid her tongue inside Mary which this time caused a groan from her and then having no idea what to do next she just wiggled it about a bit.
<br><br>
Brian smiled to himself as he looked down at the redheaded Jessica with her head between Mary's legs.
<br><br>
"Two Stuck up cows getting what they deserve," he thought to himself, "and my very own private lesbian show, too."
<br><br>
After about five minutes, by which time Jessica's tongue was getting tired he called a halt to proceedings and allowed the two women to stand up. They were both far more embarrassed than when the lift doors had opened and didn't look at Brian as he told them could go. Both women were by now very aware of the time that had elapsed since they had left Mary's office and headed for the stairs. Brian watched them go, returned the chair behind the desk and then took the lift down to the ground floor and his desk using his control override key. Once there he set about rewinding the security camera tapes!
<br><br>
Jessica and Mary descended to the basement as fast as they could and pushed through the doors to the car park. They didn't bother checking to see if anyone was out there, knowing that time was very short but ran into the middle of the car park and looked around wildly. Sheila and Teri who were sitting in Sheila's car on the far side of the basement giggled as they saw the two burst into the car park. One would scarcely have believed that the two naked females in front of them could be top executives, this thought made them giggle even more. Sheila started the engine, which instantly attracted Mary and Jessica's attention as they stood rooted to the spot trying to work out which car had started. As Sheila slowly pulled out of the parking space and cruised towards them they watched closely and then relaxed as they saw who was driving. Sheila pulled up along side them and wound down her window. Teri leant forward slightly and looked across at the pair stood beside the car.
<br><br>
"23 minutes," she told them, "You're too late."
<br><br>
"Sorry," Sheila added smiling and then said "Goodnight" as she gunned the engine and drove off in the direction of the exit. Looking in the rear view mirror she saw that Jessica and Mary were running after her, looking utterly ridiculous with hands glued to backsides and looks of utter desperation on their faces. Half way to the exit she pulled up and waited for Mary and Jessica to catch up.
<br><br>
"Please" Mary gasped as she came alongside the car, "don't leave us."
<br><br>
"No need to panic" Sheila told her as she and Teri got out of her car, "I should tell you that your stories did tally, we just decided to have some fun with you, that's all." Neither Mary or Jessica said anything as Teri told them to turn round and released their hands using a small bottle of releasing agent that she kept in her desk drawer in case anybody accidentally glued themselves to anything. As both women flexed their arms Sheila said,
<br><br>
"Your clothes are in your car, Jessica" and handed her the keys. Both Jessica and Mary had come in Jessica's car that day due to the fact that their season train tickets had been ejected from a train window the previous Friday. Jessica hurried over to her car which was very near to where Sheila had stopped and in a very short space of time was pulling on her clothes. Sheila turned to Mary and sternly ordered.
<br><br>
"Hold out one of your hands" and when Mary didn't comply she reached forward and grabbed her left wrist pulling it toward her. Turning it palm up Sheila started to apply more glue to it this time in larger quantities than before.
<br><br>
"W.. w.. what are you doing," Mary stammered
<br><br>
"I told you you'd be sorry for calling me a bitch this morning. " and before Mary could argue, in a deft movement, Sheila turned her hand over and pushed it hard into Mary's crotch. She held it there for about a minute , to allow the glue to set before letting go, leaving Mary with one hand glued to her pubic hair. Mary tried to pull her hand away and then winced as all she did was pull on her pubic hair.
<br><br>
"You can either pull your pubic hair off and get dressed or ride home naked and cut yourself free when you get there," Sheila told her in a matter of fact voice. Mary didn't wait for a reply but ran over to Jessica's car and got into the passenger seat, next to a now fully clothed Jessica. It wasn't long before they drove off frightened that Teri and Sheila might dream up something else for them to do. Sheila and Teri watched them go and then got back into their car and headed for home.

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">John Tate was not enjoying himself. He was in the school gym being put through a number of hard exercises by Mrs Tyson, his English teacher, to whom he had been cheeky in her lesson that morning. It wasn't the first time for John, he knew the drill, three quarters of an hour hard exercise instead of a lunch break. Mrs Tyson was a rather good looking 24 year old who had a reputation for standing for no nonsense, although her principle claim to fame with the boys at the school was her 38D size breasts. It was well known that she preferred to make boys sweat it out in the gym as a punishment rather than give out detentions. The only slightly odd thing was that any boy undergoing one of her punishment sessions was permitted only to wear his gym shorts and nothing else. As the gym was in an old building it only had a few windows very high up and as a result nobody could see in so there was no chance of being overlooked. There was a rumour that once a boy had forgotten his shorts and Mrs Tyson had made him exercise completely naked, but it was only a rumour.
<br><br>
"Right, that's enough, John, go and shower and don't let me have you back here again," Mrs Tyson called across the gym. John collapsed on the floor as he did the last of 30 press ups and looked up at Mrs Tyson as she leant nonchalantly on the wall.
<br><br>
"Get a move on or you'll be late for your next lesson," she told him and the sweat drenched 16 year old watched as she walked out of the gym.
<br><br>
"O those tits," he thought as he watched his English teacher depart, "I'd love to see them uncovered." He then realized what the time was and rushed off to the shower.
<br><br>
Whilst John was in the gym his best friend, Michael Dakers was hidden away in a store cupboard thumbing through the pages of a rather old girlie magazine he had acquired. He wasn't too impressed, it was very battered and to make matters worse all the words were in German. He was idly thumbing through the pages and was about to put it back in his bag when he suddenly stopped and went back a few pages. He stared intently at the page for about a minute before hurriedly stuffing the mag in his bag and rushing out of the store.
<br><br>
John was just finishing getting dressed when Michael crashed through the changing room door.
<br><br>
"Look what I've got!" he shouted as he pulled the mag from his bag.
<br><br>
"Big deal, a porn mag," John replied still short of breath from his exertions. "That bitch nearly killed me in there and you bring me a porn mag."
<br><br>
"But look!" Mike cried and thrust the appropriate page under his nose.
<br><br>
"Bloody hell," gasped John and then looked even closer just to check his eyes weren't deceiving him. He couldn't believe that he was looking at a set of photographs of Mrs Tyson, his English teacher, completely naked and displaying those breasts he lusted after. It was a younger Mrs Tyson but definitely her. Then his mind began to race, they could work this to their advantage and he could get some revenge for all the times he had endured hell in the gym. As the two lads made their way to the next lesson they began to formulate a plan, by the time they went home they had it all worked out.
<br><br>
Three days later Mike and John sat at the back of Mrs Tyson's English lesson and whispered and giggled continually. Mrs Tyson was wearing her usual tight jumper that displayed her assets admirably and she also had on one of her short skirts that stopped several inches above her knee, it was no wonder most of the boys in the school lusted after her. As expected Mrs Tyson told them to stay behind at he end of the lesson and when the time came she gave them a stern lecture before telling them to report to the gym at lunch time. The boys acted glumly but inside they were delighted, it was just what they wanted, the plan was working.
<br><br>
Lunchtime came and the two boys stood outside the gym awaiting Mrs Tyson's arrival. They were part nervous and part excited as they stood there, but did their best to conceal their emotions. There was always the chance their plan would backfire, but if it worked then they were in for the biggest treat of their lives. Mrs Tyson duly arrived and unlocked the door and they all went into the entrance hall.
<br><br>
"Get changed and meet me in the gym in two minutes," she ordered sternly and turned to enter the gym herself. She, however, stopped in her tracks and spun round as Mike said, "NO!"
<br><br>
"How dare you, you insolent boy, do as you are told," a very annoyed Mrs Tyson replied.
<br><br>
"Not today we won't," John joined in. "Its your turn to take orders from us." And with that he produced the magazine from behind his back. Mrs Tyson who was about to deliver an angry tirade at the two lads stopped dead with her mouth wide open and just stared. She recognized the magazine straight away, she had posed for those pictures whilst in Germany some years ago, she was a student short of money at the time, she couldn't believe that a copy was now in the possession of two of her pupils.
<br><br>
Groaning inwardly she said, "What do you want, money or something?"
<br><br>
"Oh no, nothing so sordid," John responded. "We just want revenge for all the hassle you've caused us."
<br><br>
"I'm sorry," Mrs Tyson replied as she tried maintain an outward appearance of being in control. "I will not be dictated to by two sixteen year old boys."
<br><br>
"Alright," John continued, "I'm sure the headmaster would love to see this," and waved the mag at her. Her mask of composure cracked as she tried desperately to snatch it but John was too quick and before she could make a second attempt he turned on his heel and went out of the building.
<br><br>
"Where's he going?" the teacher asked extremely nervous.
<br><br>
"Just to hide the evidence," Mike told her. "If you do as you are told I'm sure the head need never see it."
<br><br>
"OK," Mrs Tyson said hastily, "I'll give you a good report or something in return for the magazine." She knew if the head got the mag she would be dismissed.
<br><br>
"No, we're not interested in that," Mike informed her. "We've come up with a few things we'd like you to do for us. If they are done to our satisfaction then the magazine will be given to you."
<br><br>
"Exactly what do I have to do?" she asked.
<br><br>
"Well, to start with, one of your favourites, hard physical exercise." Mike told her. Mrs Tyson gulped, she loved to watch half naked boys sweat themselves to death under her direction, but for them to watch her was a different matter. She stood in silence for about a minute but realized that she was going to have to do whatever these lads wanted.
<br><br>
"OK, I'll do what you want," she finally agreed.
<br><br>
John returned at this point and the three of them went into the gym.
<br><br>
As soon as they were through the door Mike started to give orders. "Right, come on," said Mike. "Forty press ups to start with, get to it." Mrs Tyson got down on the floor but before she could start John interrupted.
<br><br>
"Wait," he asked her "Aren't you a bit overdressed for this sort of thing?" Mrs Tyson looked up at the lads with a very worried expression.
<br><br>
"Yes, that's a good point" Mike agreed, "you wouldn't want to get your clothes all sweaty."
<br><br>
"I don't mind," Mrs Tyson glared at them.
<br><br>
"No, come on, down to your bra and knickers, you need freedom to move."
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson saw no point in protesting and sullenly stripped until she stood there rather red faced, in just white bra and panties. Unfortunately for her she had chosen to wear a fairly revealing set of underwear, her breasts looked as though they were on the point of bursting out and her pubic hair showed on either side of the crotch of her panties but there was nothing she could do about it.
<br><br>
"Right forty press ups GO!" Mike shouted at her as John locked the gym door.
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson managed 15 before she collapsed.
<br><br>
"Come on" the boys shouted, "another 25."
<br><br>
She struggled on her lungs gasping for air, the boys gloating as they watched their English teacher, clad in only her underwear, slowly compete the required number. As soon as she had finished John ordered, "On your feet!"
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson struggled to her feet, the blood pounding in her ears, and was promptly told to turn round by Mike. As soon as she had done so he went up behind her and deftly undid her bra catch. Mrs Tyson emitted a small cry and clutched her hands over her breasts to stop the bra falling off completely.
<br><br>
"What do you think you are doing?" she asked trying to sound indignant , which was really quite difficult when she was barely dressed
<br><br>
"Right start running round the gym" John told her, choosing not to answer her question. Mrs Tyson did so still clutching her bra to her breasts. She protested to the boys for the first two laps but after that she needed all her breath to keep running. Five laps later John decided to humiliate his teacher even more.
<br><br>
"I don't want to see you touch that bra again, if it falls off you leave it, now take your hands away."
<br><br>
"Please" a desperate Mrs Tyson begged, the last thing on earth she wanted to do was expose her breasts to these two. But she knew she had no choice when John reminded her of the consequences of defying them. She took her arms away and vainly tried to keep her chest covered by not moving her arms. But due to the size of her breasts and the way they moved as she jogged it was only a lap and a half before it slid down her arms. She let it fall on the floor and carried on her face bright red with embarrassment, the sweat by now pouring off her.
<br><br>
Two laps later she was ordered to put her hands on her head and felt her face burn with shame as she jogged round her breasts on full view, swinging wildly in front of her. Mike and John felt on top of the world, as they lent against the gym wall and watched their teacher running round clad only in a pair of panties and the sight of her bouncing breasts, well it was a dream come true.
<br><br>
The irony of it all was not lost on John, a few days earlier it had been Mrs Tyson leaning against the gym wall and him running round now the roles were reversed. Eventually they had her stop and made her run on the spot and do a few sit ups for them along with a host of other exercises all of which had the effect of making her breasts bounce in all directions. When they called a halt Mrs Tyson was utterly exhausted and didn't even try to cover her breasts. She just stood in front of them hands on hips gasping for air.
<br><br>
"Report here same time tomorrow," Mike told her and with that the lads unlocked the door and departed. Mrs Tyson hastily got dressed, nipped into the toilets in an attempt to smarten up her dishevelled appearance and then hurried to her next lesson. She knew she must have smelt sweaty and was careful not to stand too close to anyone for the rest of that day.
<br><br>
The next day Mrs Tyson went to the gym at lunch time as instructed, this time, however, she had taken the precaution of wearing a more substantial set of underwear. When Mike and John arrived they got her to unlock the swimming pool instead of the gym and took her inside. When she questioned them about what was happening she was told to "wait and see". The swimming pool was next door to the gym and the only windows were in the roof meaning that there was no chance of being seen. Once again they took the precaution of locking the door behind them.
<br><br>
"Right go and put your swimsuit on, Miss," John mockingly said to her.
<br><br>
"But I haven't brought one," Mrs Tyson replied with a worried look on her face.
<br><br>
"What no costume, what are we going to do, John?" Mike asked
<br><br>
John pretended to think about it for a moment before saying, "She'll have to indulge in a spot of skinny dipping won't she?"
<br><br>
"I'll do no such thing." Mrs Tyson retorted, "I've done all I'm going to do for you."
<br><br>
"OK fine" Mike said simply" We'll just go and see the head."
<br><br>
"Alright. I'll do it," Mrs Tyson said hastily as she kicked off her shoes and undid her skirt. She was careful not to drop it on the wet swimming pool floor and put it on the bottom of the diving board steps. She then pulled her jumper over her head to reveal her bra. At this point she stopped and turned to the boys.
<br><br>
"I could swim in just my bra and knickers" she asked hopefully. It was Mike's turn to pretend to think about it as a very apprehensive English teacher stood in front of him.
<br><br>
"No, its not really on is it," he eventually responded, "You can't spend the rest of the day in wet underwear, can you?"
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson pleaded with them for several minutes but it was to no avail.
<br><br>
"Get them off," Mike finally ordered tired of her pathetic attempts to retain something of her clothes
<br><br>
Slowly Mrs Tyson undid her bra and took it off, she then slid her knickers down her legs and stepped out of them. She stood there blushing furiously her hands trying to cover her nakedness as her two pupils looked her up and down. She remembered how she had once made a lad exercise naked in the gym, but in her wildest dreams she never envisaged the tables being turned. Mike's voice snapped her back to reality.
<br><br>
"20 lengths of the pool, off you go."
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson didn't need any encouragement, she quickly slipped into the water thinking that at least some of her nakedness would be covered and began to swim. She felt strange swimming without a costume and under different circumstances she thought she could have quite enjoyed it. Mrs Tyson was quite a competent swimmer and soon did the twenty lengths and having finished she pressed close to the side of the pool, she was conscious of the boys staring at her nakedness as she had been all the time she was swimming.
<br><br>
"Not bad," Mike said as he came to the side of the pool and stood over her. Mrs Tyson pressed even closer to the pool side. "now another ten lengths please, Miss."
<br><br>
"And do them backstroke" John added with a wicked glint in his eye. Mrs Tyson went bright red again but knew it was pointless to argue and set off. The whole of the front of her body was on display as she splashed up the pool, her breasts looked as though they had a life of their own, something that was not lost on the boys. Once she was finished Mike ordered her out of the pool and into a cold shower and they both laughed as she stood under the icy jets shivering. They finally let her out and allowed her to get dried and dressed. She was still shivering as they all left , the boys telling her that as tomorrow was Saturday she was to meet them in a local park. Mrs Tyson was too cold to argue, she just acknowledged the details by nodding.
<br><br>
At eight o'clock Mrs Tyson entered the park and went over to the statue and waited. Today she should get the magazine back and be out from the control of Mike and John. The trouble was she couldn't help thinking that the two boys would have something up their sleeves. She was jolted out of her thoughts by a cheery, "Morning Miss." The boys had arrived.
<br><br>
"Morning," she replied curtly.
<br><br>
"Come with us, please," Mike told her and began to lead the way across the park. They took her to a secluded part of the park in amongst the trees and well away from any paths. They stopped on John's orders and he turned to Mrs Tyson and said, "Strip."
<br><br>
"But you said you would give me the magazine" the teacher protested.
<br><br>
"We will in due course," John told her, "but first we have a little finale planned."
<br><br>
"This isn't fair," wailed Mrs Tyson
<br><br>
"No it isn't," Mike retorted, "but tough, now get those clothes off, we haven't got all day."
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson sniffed dejectedly and took off her coat.
<br><br>
"Here," Mike said holding out a black refuse sack "Put everything in here." Mrs Tyson took the sack from him and stuffed her handbag in. She then removed her shoes and put them in as well closely followed by her jumper which she had pulled over her head. She undid the button on the waistband of her jeans but then stopped and looked desperately at the boys.
<br><br>
"Please" she begged "Don't make me strip here, you've had plenty of fun at my expense, you..."
<br><br>
"Get those jeans off," Mike interrupted.
<br><br>
"But..."
<br><br>
"NOW!"
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson sobbed and slid them down her legs and off her feet, leaving her in only bra and pants. Again she stopped and looked at the boys, traces of tears forming in her eyes.
<br><br>
"Come on," Mike commanded irritated by her tardiness, "or you won't get the mag back."
<br><br>
At hearing this Mrs Tyson quickly unhooked her bra and put it in the bag, a few seconds later her knickers joined it. She looked around desperately to see if anybody else was nearby as she tried to cover her body from the lads gaze. She was deeply humiliated by being naked in front of them even though they had seen her body before.
<br><br>
"Can I have the magazine now?" she asked in a barely audible whisper.
<br><br>
"Why certainly, Mrs Tyson," Mike replied jovially. "Give it to her, John."
<br><br>
"But I haven't got it," responded John grinning. "I thought you had it."
<br><br>
"No, you're suppose to have it."
<br><br>
"You promised," wailed Mrs Tyson.
<br><br>
"Quite right," Mike agreed. " Don't worry, we'll go and get it for you."
<br><br>
"And we'll look after your clothes as well," John added laughing.
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson bolted for the bag of clothes but Mike snatched it up as both lads ran off.
<br><br>
"Wait here, we'll be back," Mike called over his shoulder to Mrs Tyson who had started to give chase but quickly found out she couldn't run barefoot very well. The pain in her feet soon stopped her and she watched in despair as the boys disappeared leaving her completely naked in the middle of the park. She was on the verge of panic, here she was a respectable school teacher stripped and left naked by two of her pupils, it was worse than a nightmare, but she managed to calm herself down and assessed her situation. She decided that there was little chance of being discovered, there were some bushes nearby that she could hide in and she was after all well off the beaten track. So she carefully hid herself amongst the thickest clump of bushes and settled down, as best as she could, to await the lads return. As she sat there naked she couldn't help but wonder if the boys would actually come back at all and despite the fact that she kept trying to banish such a notion from her mind it kept recurring. The thought was still going round in her head as she dozed off.
<br><br>
"Reggie!"
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson awoke with a start as the voice of a women called out again "Reggie, where are you?" She froze then realized it was somebody calling their dog and breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
How the hell had she managed to fall asleep? she wondered to herself as she rapidly came to her senses.
<br><br>
Something cold touched the small of her back, her heart leapt to her throat and she involuntarily screamed before she could stop herself. She turned round to find herself staring into the face of a huge St Bernard dog.
<br><br>
"You stupid mutt," she hissed, "Piss off" and tried to push the enormous dog away. In response the dog just looked at her dolefully and then barked
<br><br>
"No please be quiet," the teacher found herself pleading with the dog.
<br><br>
"Reggie, what are you doing?" the voice asked, and the dog barked again.
<br><br>
"O Reggie, stop playing games." The voice was louder this time, Mrs Tyson tried desperately to shoo the dog away but she couldn't budge it. She could hear somebody approaching and in deep dread of being seen curled up as small as she could and closed her eyes. She stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity before she heard, "There you are Reggie, you naughty dog," and braced herself for the inevitable. But it never came instead the dog and its owner departed, she couldn't believe her luck, the dog must have wandered back to its owner just in time to save her being exposed. Slowly she relaxed, opened her eyes, and looked up, every nerve in her body was on edge and she was shaking with fear but she had got away with it. Still shaking she shuffled about and got herself as comfortable as she could and waited, a naked women waiting for her clothes to be returned by two 16 year old boys.
<br><br>
She sat there for what seemed like an eternity, she had no watch so she lost track of time, but at long last she heard somebody else approaching. She peeked round her bush and felt a certain amount of relief that it was the two lads, at the same time she began to worry as to what would happen next. Stiffly she crawled out from behind the bush to meet them.
<br><br>
Both lads laughed when they saw her.
<br><br>
"On a nature study, Miss?" John asked his naked teacher. Mrs Tyson didn't reply as she slowly stood up, once again conscious of her nakedness in their presence.
<br><br>
"Well," Mike started, "here's the magazine as promised," and threw it at her. She caught it and immediately started to tear it up attacking it with such ferocity that in the space of a couple of minutes she had reduced it to shreds. As she turned to face the boys she felt as if a great weight had been lifted off her but then she noticed the boys did not appear to be carrying the bag containing her clothes.
<br><br>
Suddenly rather concerned, she asked, "Can I have my clothes please?" The boys looked at each other.
<br><br>
"If it was down to me," Mike started, " I'd give you them but John here has decided he wants a bit more in the way of revenge."
<br><br>
"O come on, that's not fair," protested Mrs Tyson.
<br><br>
"I don't think you're in a position to argue" John reminded her. "But you do have a choice."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" asked the teacher wearily.
<br><br>
"Simple," John continued. "We took the liberty of replacing one of the refuse sacks in the bin by the main entrance with the one containing your clothes."
<br><br>
Ms Tyson groaned.
<br><br>
"So you have two choices, you can abandon your clothes and go home like that", both boys sniggered at this point, "or you can retrieve them from the rubbish bin."
<br><br>
"But I'd have to run across there naked" a horrified Mrs Tyson pointed out to them.
<br><br>
"No you don',. I just told you," John replied, "You can go home as you are if you want, but I should point out that your keys are with your clothes as well."
<br><br>
Mrs Tyson begged and pleaded, she even fell on her knees in front of the boys hoping they would relent but all they did was laugh at her. They were enjoying every minute of it, making their teacher humiliate herself in this way was something that dreams are made of as far as they were concerned.
<br><br>
They grew tired of her whining and finally Mike said, "Right, that's it, we're going now, you can do what you want, although I should warn you that they empty the bins in about an hour so don't spend all day thinking about it." At that point the two boys turned on their heels and ran, Mrs Tyson, still on her knees watched in despair.
<br><br>
"What am I going to do?" she thought to herself, her mind reeling with the implications of the situation the lads had left her in. It did not take her very long to work out that her only realistic option was to retrieve her clothes from the bin. She lived miles from the park and even if she did succeed in getting home she would have had no keys. It was clear to her that the boys intended to make her streak across the park so with her mind made up she slowly made her way to the edge of the trees. When she got there she carefully peered around the trunk of a tree and sized up what she was going to have to do. She hoped against hope that there would be nobody in the park who would recognize her, with the exception of John and Michael that is, she just knew they would be there. Looking out from behind her tree she surmised that it would be about a 400 yard dash across the park to the bin which she could clearly see in the distance. Unfortunately the trees finished where she was and it would be a dash across grass lawns completely in the open and with no cover at all. The only good news was that there were very few people in the park although there were enough to ensure that she would be seen by at least some of them. She slipped back behind the tree and wracked her brains trying to come up with an alternative way out of her predicament. No ideas were forthcoming so she peeked round the tree again, said, "Here we go, my girl" out loud to herself, and then taking a deep breath, came out from her hiding place and started to run as fast as she could towards the bin that contained her clothes.
<br><br>
She ran as fast as she could, she made no attempt to cover herself as it would only slow her down. She was, however, deeply conscious of the way her breasts bounced around as she pounded across the grass and she found herself wishing to herself that she was flat chested at this moment in time. She kept her eyes firmly focused on the bin in the distance which was slowly getting bigger, but not quick enough for her liking, it still looked a long way away. She was breathing deeply as she sprinted past a oldish man out for a quiet walk in the park. A look of astonishment registered on his face as a naked women with large jiggling breasts tore past him. He turned as fast as he could and watched the rear view of Mrs Tyson head away from him and when she disappeared from his short sighted field of vision he slowly turned again and, quietly chortling to himself, resumed his walk. Mrs Tyson hardly noticed him as she passed by, her mind was still focused on the bin, nor did she really register the women pushing a pram that she overtook, or the young couple lying on the grass who she passed within feet of. The bin was definitely getting nearer she told herself, but at the same time she was rapidly tiring, she was gasping for breath and her legs were beginning to ache. She urged herself on, she knew there was no way she could stop now.
<br><br>
"It's only another hundred yards," she told herself out loud and with her lungs screaming and the blood pounding in her ears she tried to keep up her relentless pace. Past an old women, who waved her stick in disgust and then it was only 50 yards to go, but she was slowing, her legs were turning to jelly, but she pushed on, she knew she had to. 25 yards, she was nearly there, she was going to make it, relief flooded over her and she reached the bin, looking in she was overjoyed to see her clothes were actually there. Then she realized that she was still naked in the middle of a park and furthermore she was becoming the centre of attention. She looked round hastily, her breathing in short gasps and her legs still wobbly, and spied the toilets without further ado she made a run for them having grabbed the bag containing her clothes. She staggered inside and locked herself in a cubicle before getting dressed as fast as she could. Once clothed she left the toilet and the park as rapidly as she could without attracting any attention. Nobody challenged her.
<br><br>
"Perhaps they don't recognize me with my clothes on," she thought grimly to herself as she walked out of the gates. About two minutes later two boys walked out and went in the opposite direction, one of them was holding a video camera......

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Yvonne Smallwood stamped on the brakes of her car causing it to screech to a halt. It had barely come to a stand before she was out of it and storming up the drive to the house she had abruptly pulled up outside. On reaching the front door she ignored the bell and hammered on the door with her fist. She continued to pound until the door was opened by a rather perplexed looking woman. Yvonne didn't wait for the door to open but pushed it completely open and brushed past the woman saying, in an angry voice, "I want a word with you."
<br><br>
"Mrs Smallwood-" the woman started to say but was cut off as Yvonne snapped "Don't you Mrs Smallwood me, I know exactly what you've been up to." Yvonne almost shouted.
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?" the woman responded, trying to sound calm but unable to disguise the trace of worry in her voice.
<br><br>
"You have been having an affair with my son," Yvonne snapped, "Don't deny it."
<br><br>
"N.. Nonsense," the woman stuttered in denial but clearly shaken.
<br><br>
"Yes you have and I have the proof," Yvonne told her.
<br><br>
"I don't think so," the woman, now slightly recovered, replied condescendingly.
<br><br>
Yvonne's blood boiled at her attitude and despite the fact that she was only 4' 8" tall she marched over and grabbing the woman by the collar propelled her back against the wall of the hallway. Fortunately the front door swung shut because anybody passing by would have wondered what on earth was happening in that hall. They would have seen a short thin blonde woman clad in jeans and a tee shirt holding a taller, smartly dressed brunette up against a wall by her throat.
 <br><br>
"My son has told me the whole story, Ms Evans," she hissed menacingly.
<br><br>
"But he is seventeen," Ms Evans replied realising that continued denial was useless and that she was now in deep trouble.
<br><br>
"That's not the point," the still angry Yvonne continued, "You are the deputy headmistress at his school, this is a case of gross professional misconduct if you ask me."
<br><br>
Yvonne then went on to explain how she had been suspicious for some time about the extra evening Maths lessons Ms Evans had been giving her son. Clearly Maths weren't the only things she had been teaching him and she had confronted her son about it. She had applied a bit of pressure to him and had finally extracted the truth. Angrily she concluded by saying, "When I've finished with you, you'll never work again."
<br><br>
This struck fear into Ms Evans as she was in no doubt that if Yvonne Smallwood went to the authorities her career was almost certainly finished.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry," she began, "Can we talk about this?"
<br><br>
"What is there to talk about?" Yvonne asked rather unpleasantly.
<br><br>
"Maybe we can resolve this matter without going to the authorities," she replied hopefully.
<br><br>
Yvonne who had calmed down somewhat by this time relaxed her grip on Ms Evans collar and then released it altogether.
<br><br>
"What have you got in mind?" She asked still none too pleasantly.
<br><br>
"Well, nothing really, but please can we discuss it?" she asked nervously
<br><br>
"Ok" Yvonne agreed after a moments thought.
<br><br>
"Good," Ms Evans replied slightly relieved, thinking she may have found a way out. "Lets go and sit down"
<br><br>
She lead the way into the lounge and sitting on the sofa indicated for Yvonne to sit in the armchair opposite. Ms Evans' only hope now was to persuade Yvonne not to report her and she desperately wracked her brains for a way out. Yvonne was also thinking, having calmed down a lot. She had already concluded that her son Steven was unlikely to have suffered any emotional damage from his liaisons with Ms Evans, although it baffled her as to why he chose to have an affair with this woman in her mid forties rather than a girl of his own age. In fact it would probably be worse for him, and herself, if she did report Ms Evans as the whole thing would then go public. She had already made up her mind not to take the matter any further with the education authorities but there was no way she was going to tell that to the other woman. Hoping that Ms Evans hadn't come to the same conclusion she turned her thoughts on how to teach the deputy headmistress a lesson.
<br><br>
Yvonne sat silently for well over a minute watched by a nervous Ms Evans before she sighed and said, "I'm sorry, I don't think I have any alternative but to report you."
<br><br>
"Please don't," Ms Evans begged.
<br><br>
"Well if I don't you might do it again with somebody else's son."
<br><br>
"I won't," Ms Evans nearly cried trying to assure her. "It will never happen again."
<br><br>
"How do I know my Steven isn't the first?" Yvonne continued, "you could have been up to these tricks for years."
<br><br>
"He's the first and only one," Ms Evans desperately tried to convince Yvonne.
<br><br>
The blonde mother looked thoughtful for a moment then standing up said, "No, I must report this matter" and started for the door. Ms Evans lost what little composure she had left, leapt out of her seat rushed past Yvonne and blocked the doorway.
<br><br>
"Please," she begged turning to face Yvonne, tears filling her eyes, "I'll do anything, just give me another chance. I'll be ruined if anybody finds out."
<br><br>
"You should have thought of that before," Yvonne retorted
<br><br>
"Please," Ms Evans begged again, " I really will do anything to keep my job."
<br><br>
Yvonne tried not to smile but instead gave the impression of thinking about what Ms Evans had just said. She had been manoeuvring the conversation round to get Ms Evans to agree to do anything and now she had her right where she wanted her.
<br><br>
Looking directly into Ms Evans tear filled eyes Yvonne said in a firm voice, "Anything?"
<br><br>
"Yes, anything," Ms Evans quickly assured her.
<br><br>
Yvonne gave the impression of thinking for a moment then said, "Right then, if you agree to what I have in mind then I won't go to the authorities.
<br><br>
"I agree," Ms Evans instantly responded, anything was better than ruining her career, "What do I have to do?"
<br><br>
"Wait and see," Yvonne smiled grimly, "but rest assured it will be a lesson you won't forget in a hurry."
<br><br>
For a second Ms Evans looked indecisive, somehow knowing that whatever Yvonne Smallwood had planned for her wouldn't be very pleasant.
<br><br>
"Come with me." Yvonne ordered and Ms Evans decided not to press the matter further at that moment instead saying,
<br><br>
"But I have to be at school in an hour."
<br><br>
"Well, ring up and tell them you are going to be late," Yvonne replied. Ms Evans reached for the phone and made an excuse about a dentist's appointment. As she put the phone down Yvonne headed out of the house so Ms Evans picked up her hand bag, dropped the latch and shut the door behind her before going down the drive to Yvonne's car.
<br><br>
Both women got in silence and they drove off, it wasn't for several minutes until Ms Evans broke the silence, "Where are we going ?"
<br><br>
"Wait and see" was all Yvonne said and they resumed their silent journey. Ms Evans couldn't for the life of her think what was going to happen but she was extremely nervous but she knew asking would be a waste of time.
<br><br>
Yvonne took them to the motorway and as they went down the slip road Ms Evans' curiosity once again got the better of her and she said, "I really would like to know where we are going."
<br><br>
Yvonne didn't answer her question", instead she said, "Would you mind taking off your shoes?"
<br><br>
"Pardon?" Ms Evans enquired somewhat thrown off balance by this strange request
<br><br>
"Take off your shoes," Yvonne repeated this time a little more forcefully.
<br><br>
Ms Evans, knowing she was in no position to argue, reached down and putting her handbag, which up until that point she had been clutching, by her feet she slipped off one shoe and then the other before sitting up straight again with one shoe in each hand.
<br><br>
"Throw them on the back seat," Yvonne ordered concentrating more on the traffic than her passenger. Ms Evans duly reached round and tossed them onto the rear seat.
<br><br>
"Now what?" a totally baffled Ms Evans asked.
<br><br>
"Take off that nice jacket of yours," Yvonne responded
<br><br>
"Why!" Ms Evans snapped with a sudden show of belligerence.
<br><br>
"Because if you don't I'm going to report you!" Yvonne snapped back pretending to be angry but really enjoying the confusion going through Ms Evans' mind.
<br><br>
Ms Evans shrugged and started to wriggle out of her dark green jacket.
<br><br>
"Try taking the seat belt off first," Yvonne suggested 30 seconds later when Ms Evans had succeeded in getting herself tangled up. Ms Evans released the seat belt and very soon was out of her jacket, she tried to fold it but didn't really have the room so when Yvonne simply said,
<br><br>
"In the back," she just threw it behind her to land on the shoes. This time Ms Evans said nothing, she was starting to get a nasty feeling.
<br><br>
"Still," she tried to reassure herself, "at least I'm not getting reported."
<br><br>
Her thoughts were interrupted as Yvonne spoke again.
<br><br>
"That jacket is part of a two piece suit isn't it?"
<br><br>
"Er yes," Ms Evans answered warily.
<br><br>
"Well the jacket is getting very lonely in the back seat perhaps you could let the skirt keep it company," Yvonne finished sarcastically.
<br><br>
"What are you trying to achieve?" Ms Evans asked as she started to undo the catch on the side of her skirt.
<br><br>
"That's my business," Yvonne responded icily, "If you don't like it then we can always go and see the authorities."
<br><br>
"Ok. Ok," Ms Evans hastily conceded and immediately wriggled her skirt down her thighs and past her knees. Seconds later it joined the jacket in the rear seat and a quick sideways glance from Yvonne gave her a glimpse of a rather self conscious Ms Evans trying to pull the hem of her white blouse down her thighs as far as possible. Unfortunately for her it was not a particularly long one and as a result, whilst it shielded her knickers from view, it didn't even reach the top of her tan covered stockings. Yvonne returned her concentration to the road ahead but couldn't stifle a small grin at the Ms Evans' increasing apprehension.
<br><br>
"Comfortable?" she asked the semi clad woman seated next to her just to rub it in.
<br><br>
"Do I really need to answer that?" Ms Evans replied between clenched teeth and tried again to pull her blouse down.
<br><br>
"Not really," answered Yvonne cheerily, "but you can take off your blouse for me."
<br><br>
"What here?" Ms Evans asked incredulously.
<br><br>
"Yes," Yvonne told her, "Unless you'd like me to pull over so you can get out to do it."
<br><br>
"Er no," Ms Evans replied dejectedly and started on the buttons of her blouse. It was not long before she was slipping it over her shoulders and down her arms. But once removed she clutched it to her chest rather than put it in the back of the car.
<br><br>
"Put it with the rest of your clothes," Yvonne prompted her and very reluctantly Ms Evans took the blouse away from her chest and put it in the back of the car, her arms then immediately crossed over her chest as she tried to cover herself. Another quick glance by Yvonne revealed to her that Ms Evans was wearing a matching set of lacy white underwear. To Yvonne's quick look they seemed quite attractive and not the sort of heavy duty underwear that one would imagine a middle aged teacher to wear. Then she smiled to herself, not everybody fits the stereotype, after all Ms Evans, not only has attractive underwear she has slept with a 17 year old which was not what you would expect of a woman like her.
<br><br>
"Nice underwear," she complimented the woman next to her, "by the way, your first name is Sheila, isn't it?"
<br><br>
Caught off guard by this Ms Evans who was expecting to be told to take her stockings off could only mumble a thanks for the underwear compliment and nod in acknowledgement to her name.
<br><br>
"Excellent," Yvonne chortled as she pulled out to overtake a lorry, and in a friendly tone of voice said, "Now then, Sheila, would you kindly remove those lovely stockings of yours."
<br><br>
Ms Evans said nothing but sat still with her arms crossed until they had passed the lorry before she started to peel her left stocking down. Removing it completely she dropped it in her lap before repeating the exercise with the other one. Once both were off Sheila picked them both up and tossed them over her shoulder without waiting to be told.
<br><br>
Yvonne laughed, "Glad to see your getting the hang of this."
<br><br>
"I'm not going any further," Ms Evans responded emphatically
<br><br>
"I'm not making you," Yvonne agreed, " but if that bra isn't off in the next minute then I'll be off to the authorities."
<br><br>
"I can't," Ms Evans pleaded.
<br><br>
"It's your choice" Yvonne replied.
<br><br>
Ms Evans sat motionless for a good half minute just staring straight ahead at the motorway then with a deep sigh she reached behind her back and slowly unhooked her bra catch. Releasing it her hand came round quickly to her front and clutched the cups to her breasts.
<br><br>
"In the back with it, Sheila," an amused Yvonne told her.
<br><br>
"Do I have to?" Ms Evans asked in a whisper turning to look at Yvonne. "I really have learnt my lesson and am very sorry."
<br><br>
The small blonde woman didn't return the look but continued to concentrate on her driving saying, "You know the alternative."
<br><br>
Sheila remained motionless for ten seconds or so before she groaned, muttered,
<br><br>
"Oh shit," under her breath and with a deft movement pulled the bra away from her chest threw it onto the back seats and re-crossed her arms over her now naked 36C breasts.
<br><br>
"Let's be having your knickers as well," Yvonne said without taking her eyes from the road. Sheila opened her mouth but then realised it would be futile so she lifted her bottom from the seat and with her left arm still covering her breasts used her right hand to awkwardly ease her knickers away from her bottom and then down her thighs. Once they were past her knees she placed her right hand firmly over her crotch and then worked them down to her ankles by wriggling her legs. Seconds later they were off her feet and crumpled up in the foot well of the car. Ms Evans then bent forward removing her hand from her crotch as she did so to grab the knickers and throw them into the back. Just as quickly she replaced her hand over her crotch and sat there naked, blushing with embarrassment.
<br><br>
"What happens now?" she asked in a shaky voice, not really wanting to know.
<br><br>
"That's for me to know and you to find out," Yvonne answered in a cheery voice, enjoying every moment of Ms Evans' acute discomfort.
<br><br>
"When can I get dressed again?, the naked woman pressed,
<br><br>
"When I decide," Yvonne answered and as they approached an exit she pulled over and left the motorway. Ms Evans managed to keep quiet and despite her nervous curiosity didn't ask where they were going but she was unable to maintain her silence when Yvonne drove them right round the roundabout and back onto the motorway in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
"What's happening?" she asked.
<br><br>
"You'll find out, " Yvonne answered and refused to divulge anymore despite Ms Evans' pleadings. It wasn't long before the naked teacher gave up trying to find out what was going to happen and the journey lapsed into silence. As they cruised along Ms Evans tried to cover herself especially as they overtook lorries. Yvonne deliberately slowed down as they passed by so that if they looked down the drivers could see the naked Ms Evans cringing in the passenger seat trying to protect her modesty. Clearly one or two did notice as they blew their horns or flashed their lights as Yvonne drove past. Ms Evans nearly wept with embarrassment and cursed the day she ever went near Yvonne's son. How she wished she had never given in to the temptation. Her thoughts were then rudely interrupted as she realised that Yvonne was pulling off onto the hard shoulder.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" she squealed in panic thinking there was something wrong with the car.
<br><br>
"Nothing's the matter, nothing at all," Yvonne answered airily as the car came to a halt and she switched on the hazard warning lights. Then turning to face Ms Evans she gave a wicked smile and added, "Its just that this is as far as you go."
<br><br>
"WHAT!" Ms Evans exclaimed in disbelief.
<br><br>
"This is as far as I'm taking you, Sheila," Yvonne added
<br><br>
"But this is motorway," Ms Evans gasped.
<br><br>
"I don't care," was all Yvonne responded in a stern voice, "I want you out of my car in the next minute or I swear I'll report you."
<br><br>
Ms Evans knew she had no choice and started to reach behind her for her clothes. But she started when Yvonne grabbed her wrist.
<br><br>
"No," she snapped, "the clothes stay here."
<br><br>
A look of sheer horror crossed Sheila Evans face.
<br><br>
"Yy... you've g got to be joking," she managed to splutter.
<br><br>
"No, I'm not," Yvonne answered in a firm voice. "I told you I'd teach you a lesson and I will."
<br><br>
"Please," Sheila said in a small voce but was abruptly cut off by Yvonne,
<br><br>
"Listen carefully," she began. " In case you hadn't worked it out you will find that if you go along the motorway for about half a mile you will be at the point where your school grounds back onto the motorway. I'm going to drive round there and leave your clothes in the middle of the cricket pitch. Hopefully you'll get there before somebody else does."
<br><br>
"But what if I'm seen?" a wide eyed Sheila asked scarcely believing what she was going to have to do.
<br><br>
"That's your problem, " Yvonne laughed and then added threateningly, "Now, GET OUT."
<br><br>
"No, not> here," Ms Evans cried
<br><br>
"OUT!" Yvonne re<br><br>peated and reached over the naked woman to open the passenger door.
<br><br>
"I can't," she sobbed
<br><br>
"GET OUT, THIS INSTANT!" Yvonne shouted and so shocked Ms Evans that without realising what she was doing she exited the car. Before she knew it Yvonne had reached over once more, pulled the door shut and was driving off.
<br><br>
"Noooooo!" the naked woman screamed in despair as her predicament suddenly hit home. She stood stock still for a few seconds, one arm over her breasts the other hand covering her crotch, before looking wildly round.
<br><br>
Yvonne had really left her in an appalling situation. She was totally naked on the side of a motorway and not only that, the part on which she had been left was high on an embankment with not a single shred of cover in sight. Then in the distance, probably about quarter of a mile a way, she spied a bridge over the motorway and immediately took to her heels and ran. Sheila Evans worked out occasionally and for her age still had quite a trim body but even in her own school days she had hated sport, and running in particular, but today was the race of her life as she ran as fast as she could towards the bridge. Her whole mind focused on the bridge where she hoped she would at least be able to hide behind a concrete pillar or something. She ran flat out and tried to shut out the traffic whistling past her and the fact that numerous people would be getting a great view of her naked arse and if they looked in their mirrors as they shot by, her front as well. There were a few blaring horns but for the most part due to the speed of the traffic a lot of drivers would only have got a fleeting glimpse of her and probably didn't believe their eyes for several seconds by which time it was too late to have a second look. Ms Evans kept running, yet despite her efforts the bridge still looked a long way away. Her bare feet pounded on the tarmac but she couldn't hear them due to the roar of the passing traffic. She was, however, vaguely aware of the strange sensation of her unrestrained breasts bouncing around as she ran but it was of only minor concern, as her main thoughts were concentrated on the bridge and its relative safety. Slowly the bridge began to get nearer but she was also beginning to tire, gasping for breath she willed herself onwards. Her legs ached and her heart was pounding in her chest as she pushed herself forward until at last she reached the bridge, ran behind the crash barrier and crouched down behind a large concrete support. For the short term she was safe, shielded from view by it and she just sat there gasping for breath. As she slowly recovered physically she began to think and was nearly overcome by the humiliation and potential shame of her situation. Here she was a respectable school deputy head who had seduced one of her pupils, bad enough in its own right. But now she had been reduced to running naked along a motorway by the mother of that pupil in the hope that she could save her career. Not only that she had yet to retrieve her clothes from the middle of the cricket pitch of the school where she worked. Discovery would almost certainly mean loss of her job. Yvonne Smallwood had been right when she said she would teach her a lesson she wouldn't forget. Sheila Evans was almost overcome with despair but managed to start thinking straight and looking out from her hiding place recognised where she was. With the motorway now in a cutting she worked out that she could climb up the side embankment and over the fence and them make her way from there to the school. She would be entering school grounds at the back where she knew there was a hedge to hide behind and her confidence was further bolstered by her knowledge that the cricket pitch was some distance from any school buildings so whilst she might be spotted she stood a very good chance of not being recognised. More or less fully recovered she decided to get going, there was after all the nagging worry that her clothes in the middle of the cricket pitch might be found by somebody else before she got there. There was also the fact that Yvonne might not keep her word, a thought that Sheila pushed hastily out of her mind not wanting to dwell on that concept.
<br><br>
She reached the school grounds without incident and entered through a gap in the fence and was soon peeking through a gap in the hedge that bordered the cricket pitch. She scanned the pitch and her heart leapt when she spied a black plastic bag in the middle, Yvonne had at least kept her word. Now all she had to do was retrieve her clothes and she began to scan the distant school buildings for signs of movement prior to making a dash for it. She could see nothing so edged out from her vantage point and took a deep breath ready to sprint for the bag.
<br><br>
Then she heard voices behind her and in a panic flung herself through the hedge towards the school and crouched down. The voices came closer and stopped opposite her on the other side of the hedge. Ms Evans hardly dare breathe as she realised that several of her pupils were feet away having sneaked out for a quick smoke! She slowly looked over towards the school and with a feeling of dread saw that it was the end of the first lesson and a large proportion of the school was walking around outside. Despite the distance she was from them she knew she would stand out against the hedge and was bound to be spotted sooner or later. Yet she couldn't go back through to the other side because of the smokers so she made her decision in a flash and set off towards her bag, compared with the motorway this was easy and she was soon reached it. Grabbing it on the run she then made a sharp left turn and headed for the cricket pavilion. A cry from the distance told her that she had been spotted which just caused her to quicken her already rapid pace. She had never run so fast before was at the pavilion in no time where she shot up the steps and through the door hastily slamming it behind her. There was no time to lose as the naked panting woman emptied the bag onto the floor, but then she stopped dead. All that was in the bag were her coat and shoes together with a hand-written note. She picked it up with trembling hands and read it.
<br><br>
"The rest of your clothes are in your office."
<br><br>
"Bitch," Sheila Evans spat but didn't dwell on the issue instead she rapidly pulled on the coat and seconds later slipped the shoes onto her feet.
<br><br>
"At least I'm covered again. " she thought as she quietly left the pavilion via the back door buttoning up her coat as she did so.
<br><br>
Five minutes later she entered her office, fortunately her coat being a longish one had meant she had drawn no undue attention towards herself as she crossed the campus. She let out a deep sigh as she shut the door behind her and stood for a second letting the relief flood over her. Then she spied another black bag on her desk and went over to it. This one contained the remainder of her clothes so she wasted no time in dressing and was just sitting down behind her desk to compose herself when there was a knock at the door.
<br><br>
"COME IN!" she called and the door was opened by a very flustered young man.
<br><br>
"What is it, Mr Greaves?" she asked recognising one of her Geography teachers.
<br><br>
"I thought you ought to know," he spluttered, " There has been a report of a naked woman running round the cricket pitch."
<br><br>
"Oh really Mr Greaves," she answered, "perhaps you could investigate further."
<br><br>
"Yes, Ms Evans" he replied and exited her office.
<br><br>
Ms Evans sank back in her chair, and let the relief flood over her, it had been a close thing but one thing was certain, she had definitely learnt her lesson.
<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Laura Philips kissed her husband on the cheek ,<br><br>
"See you tonight dear." He said picking up his briefcase and umbrella. Laura opened the door for him and said goodbye as he left the house walked down the drive and headed for the railway station. Another day in the city earning lots of money for them Laura thought to herself grimly, but if only he knew! The 5' 6" tall 27 year old wandered back to her kitchen and decided to have another coffee. She sat at her kitchen table , still in her dressing gown and wondered how to get herself out of her current mess. For months she had been going out on Wednesday nights, she had told her husband that she was attending a computer course but in reality she was going to the local casino and playing the roulette wheels. She had lost heavily and in desperation had borrowed money from what was a less than reputable source . To cut a long story short she now owed over '7000 and there was no way she could repay it without her husband's help. Her husband strictly disapproved of gambling and the last thing on earth she wanted to do was tell him what she had been doing. Deep in thought she finished her coffee and went upstairs to take a shower, she had an appointment with her bank manager in a couple of hours, another thing she was not looking forward to.
<br><br>
Laura had just finished plaiting her chestnut brown hair into a ponytail that reached almost to her waist and was putting the finishing touches to her makeup when the doorbell rang.<br><br>
"Damm," she said out loud to her own reflection in the mirror and putting her eyeliner on the dressing table she hurried downstairs to answer the door. On opening it she was confronted by two rather large dark suited men.<br><br>
"Mrs Philips?" the slightly smaller of the two enquired in a gruff voice.<br><br>
"Er.. yes," Laura replied nervously.<br><br>
"Good ," the other man replied, "We are here to collect the money you owe." "I don't have it at the moment" Laura hissed looking out beyond the men to see if any of the neighbours were watching.<br><br>
"Well you currently owe '7434," the first man said reading from a small piece of paper he had just produced from his pocket.<br><br>
"I know," Laura snapped angrily and still wary of the neighbours, "and I'll get it in a few days."<br><br>
"Not good enough," the second man said shaking his head, "Our boss said we either had to collect what he's owed or take you with us to explain to him personally."<br><br>
"I'm going nowhere with you and I told you I'll get your money soon" Laura retorted and started to close the door but before she realised what was happening the door had been forced wide open she was pushed back and the two men entered her house. As one of them closed the door the other said in a low menacing voice,<br><br>
"This isn't open to negotiation , we get the money or you come along to explain why not." Laura was now scared and stammered,<br><br>
"I..I'..I'll get my keys" thinking that she had better do as they said. She went into her kitchen and picked up her keys and handbag from the table, as she turned to go back she started, one of the men had followed her , obviously to make sure she didn't try and escape through the back door. Desperately trying to maintain a show of composure she pushed past the man and headed back to the front door. She then stood aside as they exited and followed them pulling her front door shut behind her. Laura briefly wondered if she should have got her coat but then decided that it was reasonably warm summers day and her expensive blue pinstripe two piece suit should be warm enough ; putting her keys in her pocket and clutching her handbag under her right arm she paused on her doorstep and quickly buttoned up the front of the jacket. Then Laura walked briskly down her drive holding her head up high, ponytail swinging defiantly behind her. She tried to maintain the impression that she was wanting to go with these men, not that she did for a second, but she had to keep appearances right for the neighbours. She reached the men's car, a black BMW with tinted glass and got into the rear seat, one of the men shut the door behind her the moment she was in , then he got into the driving seat and his associate into the passenger seat and in a short space of time they were heading down the road.<br><br>

Laura tried to talk to the two men, more to cover her nervousness than anything else but they remained silent so Laura gave up and sat back trying to stop her mind filling up with ideas of what unpleasant things might happen to her. She didn't really take much notice of where they were going and it came as a mild shock when it registered that they were heading out into the country. She was about to attempt to ask the two occupants of the front seat where they were going when the BMW pulled into a lay-by and stopped alongside a red Jaguar . A tall thin man got out of the driving seat locked the car and then got into the BMW beside Laura. As the car sped off once more with a sinking feeling Laura recognised the man as the loan shark to whom she owed the money .<br><br>
"Morning Mrs Philips." He said turning to her.<br><br>
"Hello" Laura replied and then blurted out , "I'll get you money, I promise"<br><br>
"We'll deal with that matter shortly, the man who Laura remembered was called Brian," said , "For now just sit back and enjoy the ride."<br><br>
That was about the last thing Laura could do as she sat there nervously and despite herself she could not stop fiddling with the hem of her skirt. So deep in her own thoughts she became that she started when the car suddenly stopped.<br><br>
"Time to get out." Brian informed her and opened the door on his side of the car. The driver got out and opened Laura's door and she slid her legs out of the car and stood up. As she looked around she felt the anxiety building up in her, they were in the middle of a runway on an abandoned airfield and there was nothing but grass and crumbling tarmac for at least a mile in every direction she looked. The car driver led her round to the other side of the car where Brian was leaning on it his arms folded in front of him. Laura was positioned about 10 feet away from the car and found herself looking at the three men all of whom were now leaning against the BMW. Laura waited with a feeling of dread as the men eyed her.<br><br>
"You owe me '7434" Brian said breaking the silence. "But I haven't got it" Laura wailed<br><br>
"Search her handbag, George " Brian said to the man who had driven the car. George retrieved her handbag from the back seat and brought it round to the front of the car.<br><br>
"You won't find any money in there" Laura scoffed, with a brief show of defiance<br><br>
All three ignored her as the contents of her handbag were emptied onto the bonnet of the BMW. 30 seconds was all it took for George to extract Laura's credit card holder from amongst the pile and he turned and handed it to Brian. As Laura watched the loan shark flipped the catch and thumbed through her not inconsiderable collection of cas, credit and store cards. He them went back through them and extracted about six cards before throwing the holder back onto the car bonnet. George began to scoop up the contents and return them to the handbag as Brian approached Laura.<br><br>
"Would you like to tell me the pin numbers " he asked with a smile that was anything but warm.<br><br>
"NO" Laura replied sharply.<br><br>
"Very well," Brian continued producing a mobile phone from his pocket "I'll have to contact your husband regarding repayment of your debt"<br><br>
"No," Laura conceded defeat, "I'll tell you" and reeled off the numbers for all her cards, Brian writing them down on a piece of paper. He then got Laura to repeat them as he checked each one.<br><br>
"Excellent" he said as he finished , "Now you are going to wait her whilst we go and get our money from your various account"<br><br>
Laura knew there was no way there would be enough money to cover the debt and made her mind up to run off as soon as they departed. But Brian obviously was aware of this and continued,<br><br>
"Now we don't want you running off once our backs are turned so to make sure you stay here and await our return I would be grateful if you would remove your clothes."<br><br>
Laura was dumbstruck<br><br>
"Wh'bu..Nnn'Please" she babbled not quite believing what she had heard. She took a deep breath and a second to compose herself before asking in a small voice,<br><br>
"What did you say"<br><br>
"You heard" Brian responded, "Strip"<br><br>
"Why, you can't make me" Laura pleaded noticing that for the first time George and the other man had a smile on their faces " You've got my cards, what more do you want"<br><br>
"Its simple" Brian told her " You've caused me a lot of hassle by not paying up so, to ensure you wait here for us in case there isn't enough money forthcoming from cash machines with your cards and also to teach you a little lesson your going to wait stark naked for us."<br><br>
"I can't" Laura cried in horror, "What if I'm seen."<br><br>
"Not our problem," Brian replied simply, "come on clothes off now!"<br><br>
Laura stared across the airfield not moving , she couldn't believe what she had got herself into. After a minute or so of no activity Brian's patience ran out. He addressed Laura,<br><br>
" You have a minute to remove you clothes," he told her in an irritated voice, "or I get George and Steve here to undress you" and waved his arm in the general direction of a still smiling Steve and George.<br><br>
Laura knew she had no choice, she had got herself into a situation in which she was way out of her depth so despairingly she began to unbutton her blue pinstripe jacket, certain that she would sooner remove her own clothes than be stripped by Brian's two leering henchmen. As she slid the jacket off she stopped, being in the middle of a disused runway, there was nowhere immediately apparent where she could put her expensive jacket. Brian read her mind and solved the dilemma for her by saying,<br><br>
"Drop it on the ground."<br><br>
Laura didn't bother to protest instead just letting the jacket slide through her fingers and fall in a crumpled heap at her feet, there being a slight chink as the keys in the pocket hit the tarmac.. She then slowly unbuckled the belt of her tight thigh length skirt and undid the button at the side before putting her thumbs in the waistband and wriggling it down her stocking clad legs. Her blouse was a long one and came well down her thighs ensuring that at least in the short term she maintained her modesty. Laura slowly lowered the skirt to her knees where she paused momentarily before allowing it to drop to the floor. Not bothering to step out of it Laura the proceeded to kick off her black high heeled shoes , one landing on top of her discarded jacket whilst the other fell close by. Bending over she reached under the hem of her long white blouse and took hold of the top of her left stocking before sliding it down her leg as far as her ankle. She then repeated the exercise with the right stocking only this time she remained bent over and first removed the right stocking completely and then the left. Still stood with her skirt around her she tossed both stockings to land on top of the jacket. Heart pounding she slowly straightening and forced herself to look directly at Brian and in a pleading voice said,<br><br>
"Please don't make me go any further" knowing that to remove her blouse would leave her clad in only some rather skimpy white filly underwear. Laura had never been one for exposing her body and still felt slightly uneasy about being naked in the presence of her husband, even though they had been married 6 years , yet here she was being forced to strip in broad daylight in front of three strangers. Brian was unmoved by her pleading and in reply just said,<br><br>
"Either you take off the rest of your clothes yourself or George and Steve here will be delighted to help you."<br><br>
Laura groaned inwardly before reaching down and starting to undo the buttons of her blouse. She did so incredibly slowly but was only postponing the inevitable and when she reached the last button she had no choice but to slide the blouse over her left shoulder and pull her arm out of the sleeve before pulling her right arm out of its sleeve. She didn't drop the blouse but held it up to her chest in a vain attempt to conceal her 36C breasts from the eyes of the three men as her bra struggled to contain them . But Brian was having none of it and snapped impatiently,<br><br>
" Get a move on" in such a menacing voice that Laura dare not disobey and so she dropped the blouse and reached behind her back . Locating her bra catch she found that her hands were shaking so badly she couldn't undo it and struggled for almost a minute before finally succeeding. To the three men , watching, her breasts looked as though they would break free of the bra at any second as Laura fumbled with her catch and when she did finally release it the two loose ends slipped through her fingers and whipped round to her front allowing her suddenly unfettered breasts to finally get the freedom they had been trying for. Laura quickly slid the shoulder straps down her arms and as the bra fell at her feet she crossed her arms over her chest. Looking at the men she opened her mouth to speak but Brian cut her off, saying,<br><br>
"Get you knickers off , we haven't got all day"<br><br>
"Oh no," Laura wailed, "Please let me keep my panties, please I beg you." Brian had had enough and waved his arm at the other two, they immediately started to approach Laura who cried out ,<br><br>
"Nooooo" and crouched down on her haunches still with her arms across her chest. Steve and George approached her and in a team effort that gave the distinct impression that they had done this sort of thing before, George went round behind her , bent down and encircled her waist with his arms before bodily picking her up. She kicked out at Steve but he had positioned himself to one side so that her wildly thrashing legs couldn't make contact with him. Then in a lightening quick manoeuvre he reached out put his large hand into the front of the waist band of Laura's skimpy panties and ripped them off. George held her for a good ten seconds more which gave both Steve and Brian ample to time to see, much to their surprise , that Laura had a completely bald pussy before he unceremoniously dumped her on the tarmac. Laughing , Brian mocked her,<br><br>
"Shaved our pussy have we?"<br><br>
Laura still on her knees where she had landed, moaned and curled up in a foetal position on the ground as the three men laughed at her . She had never been so humiliated in all her life yet she knew that she had brought it all on herself and she vowed at that moment never to gamble again in her life. As she knelt there wishing the ground would swallow her up Steve gathered up her clothes and put them all in the boot of the BMW, that is all apart from the ripped panties which he surreptitiously slid into his suit pocket as a souvenir . Steve slammed the boot shut and returned to stand by Brian who then spoke,<br><br>
"Stand up" he commanded and Laura knowing that she could either stand up herself or be dragged up , slowly rose covering herself with her hands as she did so until she stood in front of the men .Brian then continued,<br><br>
"We are off now to see what your cards will yield."<br><br>
"You can't leave me like this," Laura begged "Please let me have my clothes back."<br><br>
"No" Brian answered emphatically "This is to teach you a lesson about non payment of debts and besides we won't be too long"<br><br>
"Oh god" Laura said to herself more than anyone else before Brian went on<br><br>
"And just to make sure you don't lose your head and run off before we return George here has a little something for you"<br><br>
"W..what?" Laura queried nervously as George strode towards her . She took a step backwards but there was nothing she could do and when he reached her he grabbed her left wrist and pulled it out straight towards him uncovering her breasts in the process. Before Laura could do anything he had snapped handcuffs on her left wrist and then pulled her arm down rapidly forcing her to bend at the waist . The other end he then just as quickly fastened around her right ankle and immediately headed back towards the car<br><br>
"You can't do this" Laura cried as the reality of what had been done to her sunk in. The only reply was the sound of a BMW being started followed by a screech of tyres as the three men departed to get the money.<br><br>
"COME BACK!" Laura screamed and tried to run after the car, a totally futile exercise which just caused her to fall over , she did, however, manage to lift up her head enough to see the BMW disappearing down the runway.<br><br>
Laura lay there on the runway long after the car had gone from her view. She tried to get her mind around the fact that how she, a respectable 27 year old housewife, married to a successful business man and living in a nice house , had managed to end up stripped naked , hobbled and abandoned in the middle of an old airfield with no cover whatsoever . To make matters worse she knew that her cards would not cover what she owed and she began to dread what would happen when they came back. Then the thought struck her that they might not return at all and leave her to hobble around until found. Whatever transpired she was sure it would be both degrading and humiliating for her, how she wished she'd never gone to the Casino in the first place.<br><br>
<br><br>
Laura had no idea how long she had been waiting at the airfield , her watch was on her dressing table at home, but it seemed like an eternity. Having tried various positions she eventually found that the most comfortable one for a person with a wrist fastened to an ankle was sat down with knees pulled up under the chin so this was the one she adopted. Since Brian and his men had left the sun had gone behind some clouds and a slight breeze had appeared. For a naked woman with no shelter it was getting decidedly chilly , a fact attested too by the goose pimples on Laura's legs and also the stiffening of her nipples. She was just starting to shiver when she spotted the BMW in the distance as it turned onto the end of the runway and headed towards her. She felt a mixture of relief that they were returning but also was extremely worried about what would happen next. Laura sat there and waited with stomach churning.<br><br>
<br><br>
The car pulled up beside her and the three men got up and approached the naked woman. Laura looked up at Brian as he stopped in front of her.<br><br>
"We got '4560," he informed her looking down with a frowning face., "Which leaves a balance of '2874."<br><br>
"I'll get it for you soon ,I promise" Laura replied desperation showing in her voice.<br><br>
"Rubbish" Brian retorted, "Your in no position to repay my money by yourself , as well you know, so I'll give you a choice"<br><br>
"What choice?" Laura asked suddenly seeing that there might be a way out of the mess she was in.<br><br>
"Well you can either let me contact your husband" Brian started, "or you-"<br><br>
"NO" Laura interrupted, "not that , I'll do anything but that."<br><br>
"Let me finish," Brian continued, " I was going on to say , -or you can agree to accept an alternative to repaying the balance to me which will not only teach you not to get into a situation like this again but will also serve as a warning to several other clients that are getting behind on what they owe me , one in particular springs to mind. But I will tell you now it will be less than pleasant."<br><br>
"What exactly do you mean?," Laura asked, nothing could be worse than what she was currently enduring she thought.<br><br>
"You'll find out if you take the second option," Brian told her giving nothing more away ,<br><br>
"I'll give you a minute to think." Laura had made her mind up in the first 5 seconds ,anything was better than Brian contacting her husband, there was no way she wanted him to know, but she remained silent until Brian asked,<br><br>
"Well time's up, make your choice." Laura took a deep breath and said,<br><br>
" Don't contact my husband, I'll take the second option"<br><br>
"You sure?" Brian asked<br><br>
"Yes" Laura whispered in confirmation, wondering what she was letting herself in for as she noticed the evil grins on both Steve and George's faces.<br><br>
"Right ," Brian announced," Lets get on with it."<br><br>
"What are you going to do" Laura asked suddenly extremely apprehensive.<br><br>
"Let me ask you a question ," Brian answered as Steve handed him a large pair of scissors from a bag he had got from the car boot. He walked round behind Laura as Steve and Mike positioned themselves on either side of her and took hold of a shoulder and knee each to stop her moving .<br><br>
" Do you know how I to tell if a woman's hair colour is real or dyed ."<br><br>
"You look at her roots?" Laura responded mystified by the question.<br><br>
"No , I compare her head with her pussy hair to see if they match" Brian replied<br><br>
"Oh," was all Laura could say still none the wiser, before Brian continued,<br><br>
"I've decided that your head should match your pussy hair."<br><br>
"But I haven't got an-'.O MY GOD NO!" Laura screamed and began to struggle but she was held fast as Brian cut off her pony tail, dropped it to the ground and then started to snip away at the rest of her hair.<br><br>
"Please no" Laura begged unable to move and close to tears as she felt her hair falling away. She waved her head around briefly until Brian held it still by wrapping his free arm around it. Five minutes later Laura's scalp sported nothing but a short stubble as Brian reached for the bag that had contained the scissors. From it he produced a can of shaving foam and shook it briefly before applying a large proportion of it to Laura's head. It had been a strange feeling for Laura as her thick hair gradually became less and when Brian had finished with the scissors her scalp felt decidedly cold.<br><br>
"How do I explain this ,"she thought to herself mournfully as Brian got a razor out of the bag and warned the wretched woman,<br><br>
"Don't move" as he began to shave her head smooth. The warning was not really necessary as Laura had no intention of moving knowing that to do so could lead to her being cut. As she sat motionless and felt the razor removing the last of her hair all sorts of things flashed through her mind. She had the idea that once they let her go and gave her her clothes back she could go and buy a wig, in the short term she could wear a headscarf. Then she remembered that she had no money or cards so the idea of telling people she did it to raise money for charity came into her head. She knew it was a lame excuse and was still mulling it over when she felt a coarse towel on her now sensitive head which Brian was using to wipe off the last traces of shaving foam. Once he had finished the cool breeze was even more noticeable on her scalp but before she could say anything George, who along with Steve , still had hold of her said,<br><br>
"Hey boss, you've missed two bits"<br><br>
"Where? Brian queried peering closely had Laura's bald head and seeing nothing apparent."<br><br>
"Her eyebrows." Steve told him realising what George was on about before Brian did.<br><br>
"Aww" was all Laura uttered, she knew pleading to keep them would be futile and wouldn't make much difference to her overall state of things.<br><br>
"Head up" Brian told her shaking the shaving foam again. Two minutes later there was not a single hair left on Laura's body and as Brian packed the bag the other two let go of Laura who summed up her courage and asked,<br><br>
"If we are finished now may I have my clothes back" She felt a chill run through her body as all three men burst out laughing and Brian said,<br><br>
"Yes we are finished, now its time to take you home." He turned to the other two and said, "Help the lady to the car"<br><br>
Still naked and still cuffed ankle to wrist George and Steve more or less carried Laura and put her into the back seat. She wriggled about for a few seconds and ended up sat in the same position as she had been on the tarmac. She heard the car boot opened and then slammed shut as Brian put the bag in and hoped her clothes were still in there. As the men got in she caught a glance of herself in the car's rear-view mirror and gasped loudly, she hardly recognised herself without hair, this was worse than a nightmare.<br><br>
"Relax," Brian told her as he pulled his door shut , " You'll save a fortune at the hairdressers" Laura remained silent and yet again cursed herself for ever going into a casino. The car set off and as they left the airfield Laura asked about her clothes and also the cuffs.<br><br>
"I told you what I have in mind for you is not very pleasant" was all Brain would volunteer in the way off information and they continued in silence for quite some time until Laura realised they were getting near to her house. For the first time that day she panicked,<br><br>
"You can't take me home like this" she screamed looking wildly at Brian.<br><br>
"Of course we won't" he reassured her, smiling, as they reached the end of Laura's road. To her relief they drove past but then stopped about 50 yards further on .<br><br>
"Why have we stopped" she asked desperately. Brian didn't reply instead he lent over her and opened the door on her side next to the pavement.<br><br>
"Consider your debt repaid" he smiled and then pushed her out of the door ! Laura rolled onto the pavement ending up on her side, her mind numb with horror but she did hear Brian shout<br><br>
"Your door and handcuff keys are on your doorstep." just before the BMW screamed off up the road. Laura didn't lie on the pavement long she struggled to her feet and headed for her house,<br><br>
"I must get out of sight," she told herself as she walked as fast as she could bent double. Turning into her own road she knew she had to walk no further then 250 yards but she would be under the constant gaze of her neighbours and at least one of them was bound to see her. Bent over all she could see was the pavement and it seemed never ending as she progressed up the road. Her heart was pounding as she felt sure the net curtains would be twitching by now and could almost feel the gaze of her neighbours on her arched back. It was that sort of neighbourhood.<br><br>
<br><br>
At last she got to her house and trudged up the drive towards her front door. She was halfway there when the door of her next door neighbour's opened and out came Andrea Manners her neighbour. Andrea was a blonde of similar age to Laura and also a good friend,<br><br>
"Oh my god what happened." she said running over to Laura.<br><br>
"Get me inside" Laura hissed, "the keys are on the doorstep" In less than thirty seconds Laura was safely in her house and Andrea was helping to unlock the cuffs.<br><br>
"Tell me what happened" Andrea asked anxiously as Laura slowly straightened up.<br><br>
"I failed to repay some money" Laura sighed and gave her friend a brief rundown of events. By the time she had finished Andrea had gone ashen.
"W..w..wwhat did this chap look like?" she stammered Laura described Brian curious as to Andrea's reaction.<br><br>
"Oh shit" the neighbour moaned as Laura concluded her description<br><br>
"What's your problem?" Laura asked angrily as she caught sight of her own reflection in the hall mirror.<br><br>
"I owe Brian '9000 and he wants to see me tomorrow" Andrea replied close to tears.<br><br>
"Oh dear." was all Laura could think to say she had her own problems to worry about.<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Martin Halliday liked his cars, he always had a top of the range sports car and changed it every year. With a well paid job in the city he could afford to and besides he didn't have any other expensive interests or a family to keep. But strangely he was not one of those people who constantly doted over their car and polished it ever weekend, whilst he enjoyed driving and owning expensive motors they were, at the end of the day only large lumps of complicated metal. If his car got scratched or dented, it was just a fact of life to him and he took it to the garage to be repaired.
<br><br>
Backing out of the drive of his modest bungalow one Monday morning in the Toyota Celica he had purchased some three months earlier, he noticed his next door neighbour was having trouble starting her car . Being the good Samaritan he got out and went to see if he could help.,
<br><br>
"Having trouble?" he asked, walking down the drive as Mary Mitchell began to lift the bonnet of her ageing Ford Escort. Her daughter Josephine sat looking glum in the passenger seat.
<br><br>
"Damn thing won't start," Mary replied in frustration
<br><br>
Martin couldn't help but eye her up, he didn't speak much to his neighbour but at 5' 8" with curly brown hair and 38C breasts she cut quite a figure. Despite the fact that she was in her mid forties she had lost none of her looks and amazingly her daughter was the spitting image of her although being only 19 she definitely looked younger and her breasts were not as large as her mother's. From his infrequent conversations with Mary, Martin had learnt that she had lost her husband some years previously and since then she had not exactly struggled to make ends meet, but on the other hand neither was she particularly well off.
<br><br>
"We were just going on holiday," she told Martin as she looked over the engine without really having a clue at what she was looking at. "It's our first one in ages."
<br><br>
"Get in and turn it over," Martin suggested, "and I'll have a look at it," as he watched her straighten up from under the bonnet and walk round to the driver's side.
<br><br>
Several minutes later Martin said, "I think the electronic ignition has packed up, there is no way your going anywhere in it, today."
<br><br>
Mary looked heartbroken and glancing through the windscreen Martin could see that Josephine was close to tears upon hearing the terminal nature of their car's problem. It was clear to him that they had been looking forward to this holiday and had just had all their hopes dashed.
<br><br>
"Tell you what," Martin announced without a second thought, "take my car."
<br><br>
Mary looked dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"But it's brand new," she began when she finally found her voice, "and its so expensive, what if we scratch it, or worse?"
<br><br>
"Oh it's only a car," Martin replied offhand, "and it's insured. Please take it and enjoy your holiday."
<br><br>
"Well, if you're sure", Mary said uncertainly.
<br><br>
"Sure I'm sure," Martin told her, "Come on I'll give you a hand to transfer your luggage."
<br><br>
In a matter of minutes Martin had removed what he wanted from his car and installed the holidaymakers and their luggage. He quickly explained the layout of the switches and knobs before handing Mary the keys. Josephine sat excitedly in the passenger seat, she had often watched Martin in this car but never dreamed she would get to ride in it.
<br><br>
"I'll get your car fixed," Martin said as Mary started the engine.
<br><br>
"Gosh thanks," was all Mary could say as she revved the engine. She was almost as excited as her daughter.
<br><br>
"Oh, and one more thing, Mary," Martin added. " This is important, it's only insured for drivers over 25 years of age, so only you must drive."
<br><br>
"No problem," Mary said as she engaged first gear and just as she pulled away she shouted, "Thanks again."
<br><br>
Martin watched his car disappear up the road and then smiling to himself he went inside to phone a taxi.
<br><br>
A week later Martin had got their car fixed and had gone to work in it a couple of times, much to the amusement of his colleagues who joked about his poor taste in vehicles. Not that it bothered him one bit, in fact driving round in the old Escort was quite a novelty for a few days but it began to wear off after a day or two so he returned it to Mary's drive and resorted to taxis for the rest of the week. On the day of their return Martin was working on his computer and got quite engrossed in what he was doing. Only when he looked at a clock and saw that it was half past seven did he begin to wonder where they had got to. Several days earlier Mary had phoned to check that everything was alright with the house and told him they would be back on Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
"Probably stuck in traffic," Martin muttered to himself and returned to his work. It was nearly nine when the doorbell rang and Martin went to answer it. Opening it, he could immediately tell from the look on Mary's face that something was wrong. He couldn't see Josephine's face as she was stood several feet behind her mother in the gathering dusk.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" he asked worriedly.
<br><br>
Mary paused nervously before saying, "It's your car."
<br><br>
"What's happened to it?" Martin asked with a sinking feeling as he followed Mary onto his drive. His question was answered when he saw his car, even in the twilight he could make out that the passenger side was scratched and dented right from the front to the rear, the headlight was broken and the mirror was missing, all in all it looked rather a mess. But Martin was more concerned about Mary and Josephine.
<br><br>
"Are you two OK?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Y-yes, we're fine," Mary answered hesitantly, " but your car.."
<br><br>
"Never mind the car," Martin interjected, "as long as you're not hurt. Now if you come inside and tell me what happened I'll get onto my insurance company first thing Monday morning."
<br><br>
Both women followed him back into the house and into the lounge where Martin directed them to sit on the sofa. Martin made them all a coffee and then got Mary to describe what had happened. As her recounting of events progressed Martin couldn't fail to notice that they were both extremely nervous. Josephine sat there in silence, biting her nails and fidgeting whilst her mother was constantly wringing her hands as she spoke. By the time she concluded Martin was convinced that Mary was not telling him the whole truth, the trouble was how was he going to get her to admit this.
<br><br>
But he had little time to dwell on the matter because Josephine suddenly blurted out, "Mum you've got to tell him the truth."
<br><br>
"JOSEPHINE, be quiet!"
<br><br>
"Tell me what?" Martin asked in an angry voice.
<br><br>
There was a stony silence and both women stared at the carpet.
<br><br>
"Well?" Martin asked again.
<br><br>
"It's my fault really," Josephine started.
<br><br>
"No," her mother interrupted, "I shouldn't have let her."
<br><br>
"Let her do what?" Martin asked by now getting very irate.
<br><br>
"It was me," Josephine said quickly. "I was driving." And as Martin seethed she quickly related how she had begged her mother to let her drive on a country back road . Mary had finally relented and Josephine got behind the wheel; unfortunately they had hardly gone half a mile when they came round a blind corner too fast and swerved to avoid a tractor. The car had slid off the road and bounced off a tree before demolishing a fence. The farmer with the tractor had at least towed the car out for them. Martin lost his temper at this point and threw them both out of his house before he did something more serious he might regret later.
<br><br>
Three weeks later and Martin was sat in his car heading along the motorway, he was humming contentedly to himself, he had spent a lot of time sorting things out and now he was going to have a bit of fun. The day after he had got his bent car back he had calmed down sufficiently to think clearly and spent all day pondering what to do. Mary and Josephine came round to his house in the afternoon to apologize but he dismissed them curtly, he was no longer angry but decided to make them sweat. He took Monday off work and started to organize things. The garage came to collect his car and he came to a settlement with the farmer and sent him payment. This only left him trying to think how he could teach his neighbours a lesson they wouldn't forget . When he eventually came up with a scheme he rang Mary explained what he had done and got her to admit that both her and her daughter owed him for getting them off the hook. He then went on to tell her that they both deserved to be taught a lesson at which point Mary started to protest. But when Martin suggested that his insurance company might like to know what really happened she quickly relented and listened as Martin told her what he wanted her and Josephine to do the next day. As he drove along he thought about the two as they had looked at him anxiously, earlier that morning, when he had knocked on their door and presented them with two train tickets to Crewe . They were both mystified but Martin didn't wait to around for them to ask the inevitable questions instead he walked off telling them he would meet them at Crewe station at 1 pm.
<br><br>
Martin was brought back to the present as he saw the motorway exit for Crewe and it took him only 15 minutes from there until he was stood on the station platform, having parked the car, awaiting the arrival of Mary and Josephine's train. Their train pulled in a few minutes later and Martin spied the two women as they got off and looked around anxiously. He walked up to them and pleasantly asked, "Good journey?"
<br><br>
Still puzzled they both replied that they had and before they could ask any more questions he told them to follow him and led them out of the station across the road outside and into a multi-storey car park. Neither of the women had any luggage and all Martin had was a large shoulder bag which appeared to be virtually empty They then all trudged up the stairs until they reached the twelfth and final level. Martin led them out into the open air and over to the only car in sight, his.
<br><br>
Mary could contain herself no longer. "What are we doing here?" she asked tentatively.
<br><br>
"Well its very simple," Martin began, turning to face Mary and her daughter. "Here is my recently repaired car..."
<br><br>
"But," Mary started.
<br><br>
"Let me continue," Martin cut her off. " Josephine is now insured for my car so she can drive it legally and she is going to take it back home for me . You will go along to make sure she behaves."
<br><br>
"I'll make sure she does," Mary earnestly assured him.
<br><br>
"I'll know you will," Martin smiled, " because I want you both to put all your clothes in to this bag!"
<br><br>
There was a stunned silence.
<br><br>
"What did you say" Josephine asked quietly
<br><br>
"I said 'Put your clothes in this bag'," Martin repeated.
<br><br>
"Why?" Mary asked incredulously.
<br><br>
"It's simple" Martin explained, "You two bent my car and cost me a lot of money through fooling around. I covered for you to save you getting into serious trouble so now its time you learnt a little lesson, you're both going home completely naked in this car. That should ensure that your daughter drives extremely carefully shouldn't it?"
<br><br>
"Please," Mary begged
<br><br>
"You have a choice," Martin told her. "I can tell the real story or you can start stripping."
<br><br>
Mother and daughter looked at each other for a few seconds then Josephine stared at the ground as Mary looked back at Martin with pleading eyes.
<br><br>
"What's it to be?" Martin asked folding his arms and leaning back on the car.
<br><br>
Mary looked away and nobody moved for thirty seconds and then sighing quietly she put her handbag on the car bonnet and began to take off her coat
<br><br>
"MUM!" Josephine cried, "what are you doing?"
<br><br>
"What does it look like?" Mary snapped back.
<br><br>
"You're not going to do this are you?" Josephine asked in amazement.
<br><br>
"Yes I am, and so are you young lady," her mother retorted, "we don't have a choice, if Martin tells the real story we'll be in big trouble."
<br><br>
"No way," Josephine retorted as her mother handed her coat to Martin, "my clothes are staying on." .
<br><br>
"No they're not," Mary snapped angrily as she kicked off her shoes, " even if I have to strip you myself."
<br><br>
Josephine knew her mother didn't make idle threats and deciding that removing her own clothes was preferable to being forcibly stripped so grudgingly she started to undo her coat but not before giving Martin an evil stare. Martin just smiled in response as he put Mary's coat and handbag into his bag and then tossed it to land at their feet .
<br><br>
Leaning back on the bonnet of his car he said, "You can put the rest in yourselves," and then watched as they disrobed.
<br><br>
Mary bent down to pick up her shoes at the same time as Josephine threw her coat in the general direction of the bag, closely followed by her own shoes which left her barefoot . Mary said nothing but picked up the discarded articles and placed them in the bag before standing up again. She then reached to her side, undid her skirt and allowed it to drop to the ground revealing a plain white slip . The skirt remained there whilst she crossed her arms and in one movement pulled her jumper over her head showing that the slip was a full length one. She stuffed the jumper in the bag and then retrieved her skirt from the ground around her ankles. As she stood up straight she grasped the hem of her skirt and was about to pull it over her head when she stopped.
<br><br>
"What are you waiting for?" she enquired of her daughter who stood motionless in her bare feet.
<br><br>
"Nothing," Josephine snapped and began to undo her jeans which in a short space of time were in Martin's bag, a long tee shirt worn under her jumper obscured the view of her panties. Mary waited until her daughter's jumper was on its way over her head before pulling her slip up to show the plain white bra and knickers she, herself, was wearing along with a pair of tan coloured hold up stockings. Both items entered the bag simultaneously. Josephine paused again but a withering glance from her mother was all the persuasion she needed to take off her tee shirt and hand it to her mother. Martin appraised both women as they stood in front of him in their underwear. It was clear that they had both dressed for comfort when they put it on, not planning on having to display it as they were now . Josephine wore a pair of bright red knickers along with a black bra, she had evidently put on the first things that came out of her underwear drawer. Mary's plain white items at least matched but that was about all one could say for her somewhat matronly undies. Both women had stopped undressing and were staring at Martin, in their minds they were hoping that he wouldn't make them go through with this but their hopes were soon dashed.
<br><br>
"Don't let me stop you," he laughed, which was enough for Mary to reach up and release the catch on her front fastening bra and slide it down her arms allowing her 38C breasts to swing free. Throwing it over her shoulder she then slipped her hold ups down her legs and one at a time put them over her shoulder as well. Finally she placed her thumbs in the waistband of her knickers and slid them down to her ankles revealing her neatly trimmed pubic hair in the process. Completely naked, she put her last garments into the bag and Martin couldn't help but notice that she had certainly looked after her body and in different circumstances he would have complimented her on it. It was then that Mary noticed Josephine hadn't moved.
<br><br>
"Get a move on," she hissed angrily. "I don't want to stand here like this a moment longer than I have to."
<br><br>
"NO!" Josephine answered emphatically, "I'm not doing it."
<br><br>
"What!" her mother asked.
<br><br>
"I told you," she retorted, "I'm keeping these on."
<br><br>
To Martin's amazement Mary didn't even answer her daughter. She took two steps towards her and then grabbing her by the hair dragged her over to where Martin was leaning on the car bonnet. In fact, so surprised was he, that he only just managed to get out of the way as Mary threw Josephine face down across the bonnet and quick as a flash undid her bra. Before Josephine could put up much of a fight her knickers were yanked down past her knees and pulled off her kicking feet. Still held by her hair Mary heaved her back to a standing position and tugged her loosened bra down her arms in one swift move to leave her daughter as naked as she was herself. Martin was speechless for several seconds as he looked at the women. Mary stood panting slightly from her exertions, and with her anger subsiding was feeling more than a little self conscious about her nakedness, her hands crept to cover her body. Josephine was mortified, more at what her mother had just done to her, than the fact that she was naked and just stood shaking her head. Martin collected his thoughts and eyeing the two in front of him, spoke.
<br><br>
"Excellent," he began, "Now all you need to do is take my beloved car home," and reaching into his pocket he produced the keys. He disarmed the alarm with the key fob button as he walked round to the drivers door. He then opened it before looking at the decidedly apprehensive females stood in front of the Toyota. When they didn't move he joked, "Not in a hurry then?" which immediately caused the pair to move, Josephine round to the driver's side and Mary the passenger side. Both slid into their respective seats and automatically began to put on their seatbelts, Martin generously closed Josephine's door for her but not before getting a good look at her naked body, he then motioned for her to wind down the window. This she had trouble with as she looked for the window winding handle, then remembering Martin's car had electric windows, she put the key in the ignition and pressed the appropriate button. Martin crouched down to speak to them and found himself looking across the car at breast level! Maintaining his concentration he addressed them.
<br><br>
"All set?" he asked trying to sound nonchalant and not stare too much at their nude forms
<br><br>
Mary mumbled, "Yes," and Josephine nodded in agreement .
<br><br>
"Good," he continued, "Then I'll just run through things for you. All you have to do is drive this car the three hundred miles or so back home, its that simple." He paused as both women nodded before adding, "When you get home, park it on my drive, lock it, post the keys through the front letter box and then come round to the back door., Got that?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Josephine answered
<br><br>
"Right then, I don't need to remind you to drive carefully and to save you the trouble of looking there is nothing to cover yourselves with in the boot or in the back, so don't bother looking."
<br><br>
"We'll be off then," Mary smiled at him in an attempt at bravado.
<br><br>
"Just one more thing before you do," Martin responded as he reached into his pocket once more. He drew out his wallet he continued, "You'll find the old girl is a bit low on fuel so here is £20 to fill her up."
<br><br>
"We're not going to a petrol station like this,." Josephine said in a shocked voice.
<br><br>
"If you don't, you won't have enough fuel to get home," Martin told her in a matter of fact voice and without waiting for a reply he turned and gathering up the few items of discarded underwear from the car park. Placing them in the bag he zipped it up and without a backward glance headed for the lift. As he did so he heard the car engine start up and a few seconds later it moved off.
<br><br>
Josephine and Mary drove down the first few levels of the car park in silence both deep in thought. The same things were going through both their two minds, driving home naked would not be too bad, but the filling station, well that was something else.
<br><br>
"How is the fuel situation?" Mary asked breaking the silence .
<br><br>
"Not enough to get home," Josephine answered flatly and they resumed their silent descent. They exited the car park and drove down the road which the signs told them headed for the motorway. Unfortunately being in the middle of a busy city meant they had to frequently stop at traffic lights where traffic pulled up on either side. They both found themselves pushing down into the car seats as far as they could and Mary soon adopted a position with her left arm across her breasts and her right hand over her crotch. Josephine who had to drive couldn't do this, so instead she positioned her hands near the top of the steering wheel and drove with her arms out straight. This a least obscured the view of her naked breasts from the side. They had heart stopping moments on two occasions, both at traffic lights, once when a van pulled alongside and the passenger could look right down at Mary. The second time was a large lorry and this time the driver of that vehicle could have got an eyeful of Josephine if he had looked down .Fortunately neither did, or at least if they did they, kept it to themselves and they reached the motorway without incident. They relaxed slightly as they drove up the slip road and joined the traffic on the busy motorway itself, but both knew they had to fuel the car at some stage of the journey. Travelling naked in an expensive car, or any sort of car, was not something Mary wanted to repeat in a hurry, Martin was right when he said that without clothes they would be extremely careful. Mary found herself constantly looking across to the speedometer to make sure Josephine was adhering to the speed limit, she also couldn't fail to notice the steadily dropping fuel gauge. They were both concentrating on this, not really wanting to believe that Martin would leave them short of fuel but as the journey progressed they became acutely aware of fact that if they didn't spend the £20 note which Mary had carefully put in the glove box then they wouldn't get home.
<br><br>
Finally Mary broke the ice by saying, "What are we going to do for fuel?"
<br><br>
"I don't know," Josephine replied, "but we're going to need some soon."
<br><br>
The next 10 minutes or so saw them working out what to do, and the matter became all the more urgent when the low fuel warning light began to flash. They both knew they were only postponing the inevitable so Josephine took the slip road at the next junction and left the motorway. Mary had suggested this on the grounds that the motorway services were always busy so if they found a smaller garage there was likely to be less people about. They drove for about ten miles, passing several filling stations which they decided were too busy before Josephine pointed out that the fuel situation was getting critical.
<br><br>
"We've no choice," she informed her mother, "We have to go into the next one, however busy it is."
<br><br>
"You're right," her mother agreed sadly but before they had much time to discuss it further another filling station came into view. Josephine took a deep breath and swung the car into the entrance managing to pull up at the pump furthest away from the cashier.
<br><br>
She turned off the engine and staring straight ahead said, "Now what?"
<br><br>
"Fill it up of course," her mother replied observing that there was only one other car at that station and nobody seemed to be taking any notice of them.
<br><br>
"Me?" Josephine squealed in horror, "Why me?"
<br><br>
"Because you're the driver" Mary answered hoping to stay in the car.
<br><br>
"No way."
<br><br>
"Well one of us is going to have to," Mary added knowing how stubborn her daughter could be.
<br><br>
"Well its not going to be me," Josephine retorted and to emphasize her point folded her arms over her naked breasts.
<br><br>
"Look" Mary said in desperation, knowing that their inactivity would soon attract attention, "You fill it, I'll go and pay."
<br><br>
Josephine pondered the point briefly before saying, "OK" and undoing her seat belt leapt out of the car. She decided she was getting the better end of a rotten deal and was determined to get it over with as soon as possible. Bent over she made her way to the back of the car and grabbed the pump, as its internal mechanisms whirred into life she removed the filler cap and quickly stuffed the nozzle into the car filler. Still crouching, hidden between car and pump she looked up as she squeezed the trigger and watched the counters begin to roll. It seemed like an eternity as she watched the pump and wondered if it would ever reach £20 . Twice she glanced round nervously to see if she was being watched but much to her relief she wasn't. She released the trigger as it approached the magic £20, it actually stopping at £19.84 which she decided was near enough, replaced the filler cap, she hung up the pump and very quickly dived back into the safety of the car.
<br><br>
"Your turn," she said to turning to her mother, "Its pump number six, £19.84,"
<br><br>
Mary turned red with embarrassment as she thought about what she, a respectable middle aged mother, was about to have to do. With shaking hands she got the £20 note from the glove box and said, "Get the engine running," before opening the door and running straight across the forecourt towards the door which led to the shop and the cashiers desk passing a grey haired old man filling his Nissan Micra, still the only other car on the forecourt. Josephine watched, with almost a sense of triumph as her mother streaked by the man, breasts bouncing and bottom jiggling, she definitely had got the better deal here. He broke into a broad grin as she went by and Josephine could clearly see his head turn to follow her through the shop The cashier, who was extremely bored, looked up from his paper as he heard the door open. The sight that met his eyes nearly made him fall off his stool, as an attractive and completely naked woman rushed up to his desk. He stood there open mouthed as she slapped £20 down in front of him and gasped,
<br><br>
"Pump six, £19.84, keep the change."
<br><br>
She then turned and headed the way she had come with the cashier only able to utter, "Do you want your vouchers?" as he stared after her. He got no reply as she was already out of the door.
<br><br>
On exiting the shop Mary almost collided with a van driver who had just pulled up to buy some cigarettes. She managed to swerve round him as whistled and called "Nice body" after her.
<br><br>
Rather perversely she felt a sudden flush of pride at his comment and found herself calling out, "Thanks."
<br><br>
But this was instantly tempered when she saw that the old man with the Micra also had an old and extremely angry looking wife who had just got out of the car and was blocking the way .
<br><br>
"How disgusting," she spat in contempt but Mary wasn't stopping to argue about it and altered course to pass between the next set of pumps. She wasn't quite quick enough, however, to avoid the old woman swinging her walking stick and catching her across the backside. Mary howled in pain and clutched her bottom as Josephine started the engine . She made it to the car a couple of seconds later and Josephine made a sharp exit even before Mary had even closed her door.
<br><br>
"My bottom," Mary cried trying to rub it as Josephine returned them to the motorway.
<br><br>
Back at the garage, the van driver and cashier were discussing recent events with big grins on their faces. The old man came in to pay and once he was sure his wife wasn't watching smiled and said, "Bet she'll have trouble sitting tonight."
<br><br>
The van driver agreed and the cashier laughed as he dropped Mary's 16p change into a charity box.
<br><br>
The naked women regained the motorway some 15 minutes and, rigidly observing the speed limit they gradually got over the humiliation of the service station, although Mary still rubbed her bottom occasionally .Now all they had to do was get home.
<br><br>
"The hardest part is over," they thought to themselves and relaxing as best they could tried to enjoy the rest of the journey. Josephine switched on the wipers as it began to rain. Forty-five minutes later, with the rain pouring down, they were beginning to sweat again, Josephine hadn't noticed at first but eventually it dawned on her that the car was trying to wander onto the hard shoulder. The further they went the more difficult it became to keep the car in a straight line until Josephine was having quite a struggle with the steering wheel which was getting heavier and heavier. This coupled with the heavy spray from the other traffic made her extremely nervous.
<br><br>
"What's the matter with it, Mum" Josephine wailed
<br><br>
"I think we could have a puncture" Mary replied trying not to think about changing a wheel on the side of the motorway without clothes, "You'd better pull off"
<br><br>
Josephine did as she was told and they slowed up and stopped switching on the hazard warning lights as they came to a stand. Neither of them said anything, both contemplating what they were about to have to do.
<br><br>
Josephine broke the silence by asking, "Do you know how to change a wheel?"
<br><br>
"I've got a rough idea," Mary replied
<br><br>
"Good, I'll let you get on with it then," her daughter responded.
<br><br>
"Like hell," Mary snapped. "I had to go and pay at the filling station."
<br><br>
"And I had to fill the car," Josephine reminded her.
<br><br>
"OK.. ok," Mary conceded, "we'll both do this." And reached into the glove box to find the manual. They spent the next few minutes studying the relevant pages, working out the position of the jack etc. and exactly who was going to do what . Every now and then the car was rocked as a large truck thundered throwing up huge clouds of spray which was more than a little disconcerting as they carried on preparing. Plan agreed, they looked at each other grimly,
<br><br>
"Lets do this before some good Samaritan stops to help us," Mary said.
<br><br>
"Yep," Josephine agreed as she operated the boot release. "On the count of three" and then together they counted "1, 2, 3" before opening their doors and diving out of the car.
<br><br>
Sticking to the plan. Josephine went to get the spare from the boot, whilst Mary went to the front near side wheel and began to remove the wheel trim. Josephine managed to wrestle the wheel from the boot with the rain beating down on her bare back. She got it out just in time to be covered in spray as three trucks thundered past in quick succession, not pausing, however, she wheeled it round to where Mary had just managed to get the trim off . Tossing it on the verge behind her she looked up at Josephine and asked, "Wheel brace?"
<br><br>
"I'm getting it," Josephine answered and scurried back to the boot to return with it and the jack very shortly. Mary tried to loosened the wheel nuts as Josephine positioned the jack under the car.
<br><br>
"I can't move them," she said despairingly after a moment of heaving. Josephine came and joined her and putting their combined efforts into it they managed to get all four nuts freed. The rain was coming from behind them assisted by a strong wing and beat down on the naked backs of the pair as they jacked up the car. They would have been soaked to the skin under normal circumstances, but without clothes to start with this was a little difficult for them . The trucks continued to pass at frequent intervals causing plumes of spray to carry right over to their side of the car which all but drowned them on several occasions. The only good thing was that the spray and rain did a good job of obscuring passing driver's view of them and also meant a lot of them were concentrating more on their driving than happenings on the hard shoulder. The wheel changing progressed without further incident and 5 minutes later they were throwing flat tyre, jack and wheel trim into the car boot. Seconds later they were both in their respective seats hair plastered to heads and dripping wet. Shivering, Josephine started the engine and as they moved off Mary took the liberty of turning the heater on full blast.
<br><br>
The rest of the journey passed without incident and typically, about 2 miles further down the road they passed out of the rain and into bright sunshine. Neither of them commented but they were both warm and dry as they neared their home. The tension began to build up as they turned into the estate where they lived, again no words were spoken but both Mary and Josephine were wondering who was going to be in their gardens at this time of the day. A glance at the clock showed them it was 6.30 PM, they hoped that at least most people would be eating. This proved more or least correct as they turned into their own road. There was only Mr Yates in the end house visible and he was too busy mowing his grass to notice them pass by. Josephine edged the car into Martin's drive and as far down as she could get it before turning off the engine.
<br><br>
"Lock it up, post the keys through the front letterbox and then round to the back door, he said, didn't he?" Mary asked confirming what seemed like curious instructions.
<br><br>
"That's right," Josephine agreed and without further ado they both slipped out of the car, Mary went round the back straight away whilst Josephine crouched as low as she could, scurried to the front door, posted the keys and then hurried to join her mother. Mary was about to tap lightly on the door when she noticed there was a note pinned to it . With a sinking feeling she reached out and pulled it off, it was addressed to "The careful drivers". Mary did not appreciate the humour in this as she ripped it open and read the contents. It didn't take long and she groaned as she finished reading.
<br><br>
"What is it ?" Josephine asked arriving at that moment. Mary just held out the letter to her which she duly took. She then read it herself.
<br><br>
Dear Ladies.
Hope you had a pleasant journey.
<br><br>
I didn't tell you at Crewe, but I've booked myself into a hotel for the night. Will be back early tomorrow, have a nice night.
<br><br>
Martin
<br><br><br><br>

"What now?" Josephine asked glumly as she screwed up the letter and tossed it away.
<br><br>
"We're not beaten yet," her mother announced determinedly. "Follow me." Two minutes later they were at their own back door having climbed over the garden wall between the two properties. It did cross Mary's mind that it would take a lot of explaining if they were caught in this situation. How to come up with a plausible excuse for being stark naked in your back garden along with your daughter having driven three hundred miles was not something she fancied doing. To make matters worse if they told the truth they'd be in even more trouble. But they were nearly home now she thought and her spirits were raised as she reached down to the plant pot by the back door where she hid the spare back door key. But her elation turned to horror as she lifted the plant pot and instead of finding a key all she saw was another note from Martin. It simply said "I've got this key." And she slumped down on the doorstep shaking her head.
<br><br>
"The fucking bastard," she said dejectedly. "The rotten fucking bastard."
<br><br>
Josephine was shocked and momentarily forgot their predicament, she had never heard her mother swear like that before. But this was soon pushed from her mind by the fact that they now faced the prospect of being locked out of their house all night, penniless and completely naked . Josephine sat down on the doorstep next to her mother without speaking, it was going to be a long night.

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Suzanne Dickinson walked out of the country pub and across its car park, the 29-year-old six-foot tall brunette cut quite a figure as she strode towards her car, a rather expensive white BMW, her pride and joy. Being a day off from her job as a research chemist and due to the extremely hot weather she was wearing a white T-shirt which showed off her 34B breasts and tight white shorts which left little to the imagination. A pair of expensive white trainers and a pair of ankle socks completed her outfit. Clutching her purse in one hand and her car keys in the other she paused as she reached her car and for a moment was lost in thought. She considered the splendid lunchtime she had just had with a couple of old school friends but was acutely aware that she had had more to drink than she had intended . She knew she was almost certainly over the drink drive limit so she toyed with the idea of getting a taxi. But being out in the country that would mean a high cost so instead she decided to drive the ten miles or so home using the local back roads. This was no problem to her as she knew the area well and she finally convinced herself that she was not what you would call drunk even if she was a little over the limit. So flicking her ponytail defiantly she got in and started the engine but before moving off wound down the windows and opened the sunroof to let out some of the heat that had built up in the car while it had been parked. She swiftly exited the pub car park leaving a cloud of dust in her wake and headed a few hundred yards down the main road before turning off down a narrow lane. Suzanne sped down it even though it was in places not much wider than her BMW, she had driven it many times before and knew where the really bad bits were. Feeling quite relaxed and content as she started to select a cassette and was busy fiddling with the controls as she one handed guided the car round a sharp right hand bend. The power steering made this relatively easy and she glanced down at the stereo quickly in order to hit the play button but when she looked back up she had rounded the corner and was confronted by two hikers with heavy backpacks crossing the road in front of her. Instinctively she stamped on the brake pedal but in a split second realised she could not stop and the road was just too narrow to swerve round them . Suzanne screamed and closed her eyes.<\P>
<br><br>
Due to the ABS brakes the car stopped very rapidly and without the customary screech of tyres. Suzanne sat motionless for a few seconds before she dared to open her eyes and when she did she wished she hadn’t.<br><br>
"Oh my god" she said out loud and frantically scrambled to release her seat belt as she looked through the windscreen and saw that there was no sign of the hikers. In her haste her foot slipped off the clutch and the car stalled .Automatically she took the keys from the ignition , stuffed them in her pocket and with her heart in her mouth she got out and ran to the front of the car looking around wildly. There was no sign of them but when she looked around again her heart missed a beat as she saw a backpack lying in the grass verge several yards back up the road behind her car.<br><br>
"Oh no" she wailed and rushed towards the pack.<br><br>
"Are you alright" she cried in desperation as she saw that one of the hikers was underneath the pack.<br><br>
"No I’m fucking not" an angry female voice came from under the pack.<br><br>
"Here let me help you up." Suzanne offered and with a bit of heaving managed to get the hiker up into a sitting position. The hiker, a young ginger haired girl in her late teens began to undo the straps to her pack as Suzanne looked round for the other one. She was greatly relieved to see him struggle unaided to a sitting position and begin to undo his pack so she turned back to the ginger haired girl.<br><br>
"I’m so sorry." She started, "is there anything I can do."<br><br>
"Try getting some driving lessons" the girl snapped in reply.<br><br>
"Are you alright, "Susanne asked trying to soothe the girl even though she herself was trembling.<br><br>
"I think so," the girl answered, "But no thanks to you." And then she raised her voice and called to the other hiker, "Richard, are you OK?"<br><br>
"Er yes," he responded, "apart from a grazed arm"<br><br>
"Let me see." The girl said concern showing in a voice and as she stood up she found herself standing directly in front of the still shocked Suzanne. She pushed her slightly to get to Richard but as she brushed passed her caught a whiff of Susanne’s breath and whirled round.<br><br>
"You’ve been drinking," she spat accusingly.<br><br>
"I.. I. …Haven’t had much," Susanne stammered defensively.<br><br>
"We’ll let the police be the judge of that, shall we" she replied looking Suzanne with a look of disgust.<br><br>
"I’m sorry." Suzanne whispered looking away.<br><br>
"Ha" the girl retorted, "I thought so," and marching over to Richard she said,<br><br>
"Richard, have you got the mobile phone?"<br><br>
"It’s in the side pocket" he replied, "and can you get the first aid kit while you’re at it."<br><br>
"Oh shit," the girl answered, "sorry I forgot about your arm, I’ll call the police and then deal with it."<br><br><br><br><br><br>



Susanne’s mind was in a whirl, she may well be under the limit, in fact, there was a good chance by the time the police arrived , but she dare not risk it. Lose her licence and there was every possibility her job would be on the line too.
"Please don’t," she said as she saw the girl getting out the mobile phone, " perhaps we can sort this out amongst ourselves."<br><br>
"You’ve been drinking and you’ve hurt my boyfriend here." the girl snapped back, "only the police can sort this out."<br><br>
At this point Richard winced as he pulled up his sleeve and the look of concern once again crossed the girl’s face.<br><br>
"Let me look" she said, crouching down beside him and putting the phone down beside him.<br><br>
"It’s not that bad, Tina." He replied using her name for the first time.<br><br>
"I’ll be the judge of that" Tina told him gently and then started to wrap a bandage around his arm.<br><br>
Richard began to wonder what she was cooking up now as he only had two slight grazes on his forearm and thought a bandage was a bit over the top, medically speaking two medium sizes plasters would have sufficed. He also noticed that Tina used her body to shield the view of his arm from a very nervous looking Suzanne who stood in the middle of the road wringing her hands and surmised she was up to something but knew better than to ask. Having spent a fair amount of time seeming to tend to Richard’s wounds Tina rolled down his sleeve before suddenly standing up and whirling round to face the other woman. Suzanne was rather startled by this sudden movement and was further caught off guard as Tina announced,<br><br>
" He is going to need hospital treatment"<br><br>
"I’ll drive you then," Suzanne managed to answered,<br><br>
"Not a chance" Tina retorted, " Do you think for one minute we are getting in a car with a drunk?"<br><br>
"I’m not drunk," Suzanne protested,<br><br>
"Well the police can always decide that," Tina replied and reached for the mobile phone which was still on the grass next to Richard.<br><br>
"No please" Suzanne said desperate to avoid the police becoming involved,<br><br>
"I can give you money", she finished lamely and as soon as she uttered those words she knew she had said the wrong thing.<br><br>
"Give us money," Tina spat in contempt, " You think that you can nearly kill us and then get off the hook by bribing us?"<br><br>
"N.no" Suzanne stammered before Tina continued her tirade.<br><br>
"Well let me tell you , you stuck up cow, just because you drive a fancy car and no doubt earn a lot of money you think you can give us a bit of money and sweep everything under the carpet."<br><br>
Suzanne looked at her feet not daring to speak.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
"It doesn’t work like that you bitch , I’m going to make sure you pay for what you’ve done to Richard." And once more she reached for the mobile phone.<br><br>
"Please ," Suzanne pleaded close to panic as she saw her life was on the brink of being ruined by this young student. "What can I do to change your mind?"<br><br>
"Nothing," Tina snapped.<br><br>
"I’ll do anything" Suzanne offered, " just don’t call the police."<br><br>
"OK then," Tina immediately replied looking straight at Suzanne, "Give me your car keys so I can take Richard to hospital."<br><br>
"Yes sure," Suzanne responded without a second thought desperate to avoid the police and immediately began fumbling in her pockets. Then she stopped unable to find them at which point it dawned on her they were still in the car.<br><br>
"They’re in the ignition." still she told Tina sheepishly. Tina just snorted and picking up her back pack went round to the back of the car and opening the boot heaved it in . She then went over to where Richard was and picked up his backpack and took that to the boot also. Slamming the lid shut she saw that Richard was still sat on the grass verge so called out.<br><br>
"Get in then." which prompted him to slowly get to his feet and make his way to the car. Suzanne also headed for her BMW but was stopped in her track when Tina said icily,<br><br>
"And where are you going."<br><br>
"Err to get in the car" Suzanne replied nervously.<br><br>
"O no you’re not," Tina told her, "You can wait here."<br><br>
"WHAT!" Suzanne cried not believing that she had heard correctly.<br><br>
"You can wait here," Tina repeated, " we don’t want your company." Suzanne opened her mouth to speak but then closed it and slumped her shoulders in defeat. She was about to be left behind as two students took off in her car but it was infinitely better than the alternative.<\P><br><br>
Tina smiled as she looked at the woman stood by the side of the road and was walking round to the driver’s door when a black file on the back seat caught her eye or to be more accurate the name on it. She quickly opened the back door and grabbed the file and reread the name on it just to be sure<br><br>
"VR Research laboratories" was printed on it in gold. She waved the file in the air and looked accusingly at Suzanne across the road,<br><br>
"You work for this outfit." She asked unpleasantly.<br><br>
"Yes I do," Suzanne replied nervously, "I’m a research chemist"<br><br>
"Research Chemist" Tina cried and once again Suzanne realised she had said the wrong thing.<br><br>
"You’ll be one of those bastards who experiment on animals then?" she continued angrily<br><br>
"NO" Suzanne cried, which was in fact the truth , her employer had given up testing things on animals years ago but the animal rights movements had never believed this. Unfortunately for Suzanne, Tina was a great believer in animal rights!<br><br>
Tina crouched down and looked into the car at Richard, he also shared her beliefs and the thought of getting a bit of revenge on one who they perceived as being involved in animal cruelty was an opportunity too good to miss. Tina smirked at him said , "Watch this" quietly and then stood up to look over at Susanne before saying in a louder voice.<br><br>
"STRIP!"<br><br>
Suzanne just stood there not really understanding<br><br>
"P..pardon?" she managed to ask but before she could say anything else, Tina , as if reading her mind repeated her original command, "STRIP! ", and then folding her arms stared directly at Suzanne.<br><br>
Then a look of shock crossed her face as she realised what Tina meant.<br><br>
"You must be joking," she replied firmly having regained a little composure.<br><br>
"There’s always the alternative," Tina answered and with an evil smile produced the mobile phone.<br><br>
"No not that," Suzanne said hastily to which Tina promptly responded,<br><br>
"Well the choice is yours."<br><br>
"You really want me to take off my clothes here?" she asked horrified at the prospect.<br><br>
"Yes" Tina answered emphatically<br><br>
"Every stitch," Richard added lowering the window of the car with a big grin on his face.<br><br>
"You can’t be serious," Suzanne said but knew realistically she had no choice . She was, however, unable to bring herself to accept the fact that she was going to have to remove all her clothes in front of two students in the middle of the country. She stood there motionless<br><br>
"We haven’t got all day." Tina prompted Suzanne after at least a minute of inactivity had passed.<br><br>
"Why?" was all Suzanne could manage to say.<br><br>
"Thats easy," Tina told her, "this will probably be the only chance I will ever have to get back at you and your type."<br><br>
"But we don’t use animals anymore" Suzanne wailed immediately understanding the point Tina was making.<br><br>
"Somehow I don’t believe you, so strip right now or I call the police." Tina said in a firm voice.<br><br>
"This can’t be happening," Suzanne mumbled more to herself than anyone else and bent down to undo the laces of her trainers. She pulled them off and then slowly peeled off her socks. She remained bent over and screwed both her socks up before pushing one in each trainer. This she did not hurry in doing trying to postpone the moment when she had to stand up and continue stripping. Tina sensed this and said,<br><br>
"Don’t dawdle."<br><br>
Suzanne slowly stood up avoiding looking at the students and tried to make up her mind what to remove next. Decision made she reached for the waistband of her shorts and undid the button holding them before starting to wriggle them down her hips. This was a difficult affair due to their tightness and was not easily accomplished in the privacy of her bedroom . On the side of a country road it was even worse but she twisted and wriggled and finally succeeded in pushing them down to her knees before dropping them to her ankles and stepping out of them. Not knowing what to do with them she left them on the tarmac next to her trainers. A glance in the direction of the students confirmed in her mind that there would be no hope of reasoning with them. Tina stood leaning on the back of the car, her arms folded with a stern look on her face. Richard was still sat in the car and was positively leering at Suzanne and clearly enjoying every moment of her embarrassment. Suzanne looked away and slowly pulled the T-shirt over her head to reveal that her underwear was also white and that it was not exactly modest. She dropped the T-shirt on the road and stood blushing in just her bra and panties.<br><br>
"Isn’t this enough" she tried to ask knowing it was almost certainly a futile gesture but one she had to try if she wasn’t to be stripped.<br><br>
"No" both Tina and Richard answered in unison and then Tina continued alone,<br><br>
"We want every stitch, ,"She laughed and then added "Your underwear doesn’t hide much anyway so you might as well get it off." This was perfectly true, Suzanne flimsy bra just about held her breasts and her tiny panties were so thin her pubic hair could be clearly seen through the material<br><br>
"Oh please" Suzanne begged<br><br>
"STRIP RIGHT NOW! Tina shouted angrily<br><br>
"NO" Suzanne shouted back suddenly defiant<br><br>
Tina didn’t reply but instead strode over to where the Suzanne stood . Before the older woman knew what was happening Tina grabbed hold of her bra at the front between the cups and gave an almighty tug. The thin straps stood no chance and snapped as the whole garment came away in Tina’s hand and a split second later Suzanne screamed and crossed her arms over her now naked breasts. Tina dropped the remains of the bra on top of the discarded T-shirt before she moved closer to the cringing chemist until their faces were only a few inches apart.<br><br>
"Listen" she hissed, "You can either slip out of your pretty little knickers yourself or," she paused briefly to let the words sink in, " I can rip them off for you, its your choice." Suzanne managed to stammer,<br><br>
"I…I.. I’ll take them off,"<br><br>
"Good" Tina replied and took several steps back and folded her arms, "now get on with it. A trembling and totally humiliated Suzanne began to wriggle her last scrap of clothing down her thighs. Her face burned red with shame as she stood in a half crouch trying to cover her breasts with her left arm whilst using her right hand to carefully lower her knickers and at the same time not reveal her crotch to the students’ gaze. Once the panties were past her thighs she kept her hand permanently on her pubic hair and wriggled her legs until they fell to the ground . Silently she stepped out of them and stood totally naked in front of the students.<br><br>
"What happens now ," she eventually managed to ask in a small voice.<br><br>
"The same as before" Tina informed her, "you wait here while we go and find a hospital.<br><br>
"But I’m naked" she wailed horrified at the thought<br><br>
"Well spotted" Richard laughed, not really looking like he needed a hospital at all.<br><br>
"Naked and left in the middle of nowhere" Tina added as she walked towards the nude woman and crouched down to pick up the clothes lying in the road.<br><br>
"You can’t do this" Suzanne tried to argue but was abruptly cut short by the still crouching Tina,<br><br>
"Oh yes we can, remember the alternative…." Suzanne went silent and hung her head in defeat. As Tina stood up again , now with all of Suzanne’s clothes in her hands she paused suddenly looking thoughtful then strode over to the car and spoke to Richard in a low voice , so Suzanne couldn’t here. The conversation was brief and at the end of it Richard said , in a much louder voice,<br><br>
"Yep., lets do it." And proceeded to get out of the car . Tina stood back to let him get out and then lent in and threw all Suzanne’s clothes on to the back seat. She then went back to the cringing Suzanne who was still trying to cover her nakedness as well as look up and down the road to see if anyone was coming. Suzanne managed to look Tina in the face but couldn’t maintain eye contact when she saw a wicked grin,<br><br>
"I’ve just had a word with Richard," she announced smiling evilly, "and we both agree that it would be most appropriate for you to participate in a little experiment of ours.<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Suzanne asked nervously , her eyes looked past Tina to see Richard rummaging in the car boot.<br><br>
"Well," Tina explained, "You spend your time experimenting on animals so we thought it appropriate that, today, you can be the subject of an experiment for a change."<br><br>
"This can’t be happening" Suzanne moaned.<br><br>
"Oh yes it is" Tina goaded her, " You’ll remember today for a long time.<br><br>
"Please," Suzanne begged, " being left naked is surely enough."<br><br>
"It enough just for a drunk driver" Tina replied, "but not for someone in your line of work." Suzanne remained silent.<br><br>
<br><br>
Richard slammed the car boot and came over to the two women, his pockets bulged with something , but Suzanne had no idea what.<br><br>
"Ready?" Tina asked<br><br>
"Ready," he replied.<br><br>
"Right then," Tina addressed the naked blonde woman, "Follow me" and started to lead the way up the road.<br><br>
"What’s happening," Suzanne asked nervously<br><br>
"Wait and see." Was all the answer she got from Tina.<br><br>
They came to the point where the footpath crossed the road where Tina climbed over the stile and in to the adjoining field followed by Suzanne who was more than a little conscious that Richard was following close behind her. She managed to negotiate the stile with her arm still covering her breasts but a glance behind confirmed her fear that Richard was viewing her naked flesh with more than passing interest. Tina stopped momentarily and surveyed the field they had just entered, and then obviously seeing what she wanted , she set off again, the other too following. Suzanne didn’t take much notice of where they were going , as they had set off she had looked round and ascertained that there was nobody around and as they walked she was more concerned with making sure she didn’t step on any thistles or anything else that might hurt her bare feet So absorbed in protecting her feet was she that she nearly walked into the back of Tina when she stopped. Suzanne looked up and gasped, they must have been about fifty metres from the footpath and at the highest point in the field She had an ominous feeling.<br><br>
"This will do just fine" Tina announced, " for our little experiment."<br><br>
"What’s going to happen." Suzanne asked with a sinking feeling<br><br>
"Get on your hands and knees" Tina responded and pointed to the ground in front of her<br><br>
"Why" Suzanne queried.<br><br>
She jumped as Richard put his hand on her shoulder from behind and said,<br><br>
"Because you don’t have a choice"<br><br>
Suzanne knew he was right and slowly got down in front of Tina.<br><br>
"Turn round and face the road," Tina ordered and Suzanne shuffled round without looking up, she just stared down at the grass in front of her face. She felt her ponytail slide down the side of her neck and at the same time she became conscious of the feeling of her naked breasts swinging beneath her. A picture of what she must look like flashed through her mind and she closed her eyes as her face burned red with shame.<br><br>
"Good" Tina said, once she had Suzanne positioned to her satisfaction," now for the next part."<br><br>
Richard handed her the contents of his pocket ,which consisted of a tin of corn beef and a felt tip pen. Tina took them, crouched down alongside Suzanne and with a smile on her face placed the tin in the middle of the naked woman’s back. Suzanne gasped as she felt the cold metal on her naked skin but was unable to say anything before Tina said,<br><br>
"Don’t move" and taking the felt tip pen from Richard she removed the cap and carefully drew round the tin.<br><br>
"What are you doing?," Suzanne asked nervously, as whilst she could feel the pen she had no idea what was happening Tina finished drawing and handed the pen back to Richard before answering.<br><br>
"Ah well ,this is a little experiment we’ve decided to conduct using you as the subject." Tina explained,<br><br>
" We’re off to the hospital in a minute" and you can wait here for us."<br><br>
"But I can be seen from the path and the road "Suzanne protested<br><br>
"Exactly", Tina continued, "which leads you to have to make few decisions." Suzanne groaned, she didn’t like the sound of this.<br><br>
"On your back," Tina went on, " there is a tin of corned beef which I’ve just drawn round, the object of the exercise is for it not to move whilst we are away. If when we get back its not inside its mark then you don’t get your clothes or your car back; in short we’ll abandon you here."<br><br>
"What if I’m seen" Suzanne wailed<br><br>
"Well that’s where you have to make a decision." Tina laughed, " You can stay here on top of this hill and hope you are not see or you can try and move to a less exposed place. But just remember if that tin has moved even a tiny bit then that’s it."<br><br>
"Unless you find somebody to ask to put it back for you ," Richard added jokingly.<br><br>
"Please don’t do this to me," Suzanne begged .<br><br>
"Pleading won’t get you anywhere ," Tina told her before saying to Richard,<br><br>
"Lets go" and without further ado the two students headed back down the hill towards the car. Suzanne lifted her head and watched them go and desperately wondered what to do next.<br><br>
Tina and Richard stopped when they got to the stile and looked back up the hill. There on top was Suzanne in all her naked glory. They both laughed as they climbed the stile and walked towards the car. Suzanne heard her car start up and head off down the road and couldn’t help thinking of her clothes lying on the back seat……<br><br>
Suzanne couldn’t believe the situation she was now in, and more to the point what was she going to do. Tina had been right when she said that Suzanne would have to make a few decisions. As she knelt there stark naked with the tin balanced on her back she tried to think clearly about her options. She was currently on top of a small hill in full view of the surrounding area and more than likely to be spotted if anybody came along the path,. There was also a chance she might be seen from the road. There again there was also the likelihood that nobody would come along the path before Tina and Richard returned. But when would that be? Would they even come back?. If she moved and the tin fell off then she wouldn’t get her car or clothes back….. Her mind was in a whirl , there were so many options. She didn’t know what to do. A more noticeable problem, apart from her knees beginning to ache a bit, was the sun beating down on her back. It was a gloriously hot summer day but she could already feel her back getting sunburnt , however, she knew there was nothing she could do about it so tried to put it out of her mind and work out what to do about her predicament. After a lot of thought she decided to take her chances and stay put. She hoped the students wouldn’t take too long at the hospital and then tried to concentrate on saying still. Another mental image of what she must look like balancing the tin flashed into her head and she groaned inwardly.<br><br>
<br><br>
Suzanne had lost track of time, she had no watch so had no idea how long she had been there but it had been quite a while she thought to herself. She was just thinking how lucky she was when she saw two figures climbing over the stile. Her heart missed a beat as she immediately knew they were not Tina and Richard. She could clearly see that these two were obviously an elderly couple out for an afternoon stroll. Suzanne prayed that they were old enough so that their eyesight was not that good and they would fail to spot her. Her heart was in her mouth as she watched them slowly pass along the path. The thought of the humiliation of being spotted and then explaining what she was doing was too much to bear, she closed her eyes. But her prayers were answered as the couple never spotted her and went on their way enjoying the countryside. When Suzanne finally plucked up the courage to open her eyes she was greatly relieved to see that they had gone. Her heart began to stop pounding and she turned her attention to other matters.<br><br>
<br><br>
The sun was still beating down and as well as now most definitely being sunburnt, Suzanne was sweating in the heat and consequently she was starting to feel very thirsty. These thoughts were briefly banished from her mind as a solitary car sped down the lane and round the corner where she had come to grief. The driver was obviously concentrating on the road and there was no danger of her being spotted. From then on Suzanne was well and truly on her own and despite her predicament her mind began to wander and after a while she closed her eyes in a daydream . After some time she was thinking about mowing her lawn and was trying to work out why her lawnmower sounded like and old tractor.<br><br>
<br><br>
She gasped and opened her eyes wide as it suddenly dawned on her that the noise was not something she was dreaming . The reason why she though her lawn mower sounded like an old tractor was all too apparent as she looked down to the road, a real tractor had pulled onto the verge by the stile. Her heart once again returned to her mouth,<br><br>
"Oh no," she moaned as she heard the engine stop and saw the farmer get down. She had to stop herself from trembling , still mindful of the tin on her back, and watched with trepidation as he climbed the stile and started along the footpath. He obviously had no business in the same field as Suzanne as he strode purposefully along the footpath towards the next one. As he disappeared from her view Suzanne breathed a small sigh of relief although she was painfully aware that he still had to return to his tractor. She hoped that the students would return before he came back. Suzanne looked down to the tractor and sighed, her back was really hurting now.<br><br>
<br><br>
"Hello?" a male voice behind her said.<br><br>
Suzanne screamed and instinctively sat up covering her chest as she did so; the tin tumbled down her back and landed in the grass by her left leg. Suzanne pressed her knees together and closed her eyes , not daring to look round.<br><br>
"Are you alright," the voice asked her with a trace of concern.<br><br>"Yes , I’m fine thank you," was all she could manage to say in reply eyes tightly closed and face once again red with embarrassment.<br><br>
"OK then, what exactly are you doing." The voice asked.<br><br>
"I’m er… well I’m," Suzanne mumbled as she wracked her brains for an excuse.<br><br>
"I lost a bet." She finally finished lamely and not entirely convincingly.<br><br>
"I see," the voice laughed as Suzanne heard him walk round in front of her,<br><br>
"And you have to kneel here naked?"<br><br>
"Yes," Suzanne whispered not wishing to be reminded of her current situation.<br><br>
"For how long ?<br><br>
"I don’t know," Suzanne replied truthfully<br><br>
There was a long silent pause which seemed like an eternity to Suzanne before the voice suddenly<br><br>
"Nice view from here." Suzanne’s felt a wave of indignation at what she perceived to be a suggestive remark and momentarily forgetting her predicament she opened her eyes. She immediately realised her error as she saw in from of her the farmer who had traversed the path earlier. He wasn’t looking at her but at the view of the countryside. The man was dressed in overalls and to Suzanne’s brief glance only looked to be in his mid thirties. Suzanne suddenly felt very vulnerable kneeling in front of a clothed man and pressed her knees even tighter together.<br><br>
The farmer turned round to Suzanne who went even redder under his gaze but then his eyes locked on to the corned beef tin .<br><br>
"What’s with the tin?" he enquired<br><br>
"I have to balance it on my back," she told him, "or I don’t get my clothes back." Then the truth of what she had said hit her,<br><br>
"OH NO" she cried in despair<br><br>
"What’s the matter ," the farmer asked<br><br>
"Please can you help me," she asked desperately getting back on all fours," put the tin on my back, there should be a mark."<br><br>
"And if I don’t?" the farmer asked with a wicked grin on his face.<br><br>
"Then I don’t get my clothes back." Suzanne told him mournfully, "I’ll be left here naked<br><br>
"That would be most unfortunate." The farmer agreed sarcastically<br><br>
"Oh help me please," Suzanne begged<br><br>
"Of course I will," the farmer said deciding to put her out of her misery, "but you really want to put something on your back for the sunburn.<br><br>
"There’s not a lot I can do about it ," Suzanne answered sadly, "I’m also getting very thirsty."<br><br>
"Ah" the farmer responded , "I can’t do anything about the sunburn , but I can help you with the thirst, I’ve a bottle of Coke in the tractor"<br><br>
"That would be nice," Suzanne said getting back off all fours.<br><br>
"Yes it would," the farmer agreed, "perhaps you’d like to go and get it?"<br><br>
"What ? Me?" Suzanne spluttered, "But I’m naked"<br><br>
"I can see that," the farmer laughed, " but if you want the drink then you can get it."<br><br>
"I’ll do without," Suzanne replied getting back on her hands and knees."<br><br>
"Fine," the farmer then said, " but I fancy a drink now"<br><br>
"Then you get it," Suzanne told him with a hint of annoyance in her voice.<br><br>
"I will," he replied, but if I go I’m not coming back and the tin stays on the grass."<br><br>
"Oh" Suzanne said dejectedly, immediately realising she was in a no win situation. It only took her a few seconds to make up her mind,<br><br>
"I’ll get it for you," she said quietly as she rose to her feet and looked at the grinning farmer. A touch of modesty overcame her once more as she tried to cover herself from his gaze.<br><br>
"Off you go then," he said after a moment and Suzanne took a deep breath and ran down the field to the stile and the parked tractor. As she ran once again she was acutely aware of her nakedness and looked around as best she could to see if there was anybody on the footpath. The feeling of her naked breasts bouncing around was a strange one and not something she enjoyed but being downhill it did not take her long to reach the stile and she quickly scrambled over it and made her way to the tractor. Not being particularly familiar with agricultural machinery she took a moment to work out how to get into the cab but just as she was about to climb up she heard a car coming down the lane. Fighting the urge to panic she quickly crouched down behind the tractor’s large rear wheel and made herself as small as possible hoping not to be seen as it passed by.<br><br>
<br><br>
She listened, heart pounding as the car approached but instead of passing her and continuing along the lane it slowed , pulled up behind the tractor and stopped. Suzanne, closed her eyes, tried to make herself even smaller as she heard car doors open and close. The there was silence, which seemed like an eternity to Suzanne as she crouched frightened an motionless. Suddenly a voice spoke,<br><br>
"What have we here then?"<br><br>
Suzanne started and then felt that sinking feeling return to her stomach as she recognised the voice as that of Tina’s.<br><br>
"Looks like, your little experiment failed," another voice, that of Richard’s said.<br><br>
"Yep, Tina agreed, "Our scientist friend here is going to have a long walk home." Suzanne still crouching turned to face the students,<br><br>
"Please" she begged, I’ve got to get a bottle of Coke for the farmer who owns this tractor or else he won’t replace the tin."<br><br>
"Farmer?" Tina queried warily, "What farmer?"<br><br>
"The one who is waiting where you left me," Suzanne explained.<br><br>
"I see," Tina said, slightly unnerved by the involvement of a third party, " We’ll take your car for a drive and will be back in half an hour, you’d better be back as we left you by ten.<br><br>
"I will," Suzanne assured her and then watched as the students got back in the car and drove off.<br><br>
Suzanne wasted no time in retrieving the Coke from the tractor and in a short space of time was heading back up the hill. She arrived back where the farmer was waiting slightly out of breath and held the bottle out to him. The farmer took it and as he unscrewed the top he asked,<br><br>
"Friends of your?"<br><br>
"Not exactly" she answered eyeing the farmer enviously as he took a long drink of the coke.<br><br>
"Oh" said the farmer when he had finished drinking, " they’re the ones you lost the bet too." And then he held out the bottle to her.<br><br>
"Yes," was all Suzanne could manage to fit in before her lips closed greedily around the neck of the Coke bottle and she gulped it down. When she had finished drinking se handed the bottle back to the farmer saying,<br><br>
"Thanks"<br><br>
"Thats alright," He smiled and continued, " I suppose you want the tin replacing now.?"<br><br>
"Yes please" Suzanne replied eager not to be caught out by the students again.<br><br>
As Suzanne got onto her hands and knees once more the farmer picked up the tin and shaking his head put it on her back.<br><br>
"There aren’t half some strange people around ." he thought to himself as he let go of the tin and stood up again.<br><br>
"You’ll be Ok then?" he asked, looking down at the naked woman in front of him.<br><br>
" As well as I can be," Suzanne responded without trying to look up.<br><br>
"Goodbye then, " the farmer said as he set off down the hill towards the tractor.<br><br>
"Goodbye" Suzanne called after him which caused him to shake his head once more.<br><br>
Alone again Suzanne pondered her fate, hoping that the students would soon be back with her car and her clothes. Her back was now very sore and the sun still beat down on it as she knelt there. At long last she saw a car approach and when it pulled up by the stile she recognised it as hers. Nervously she watched as the students got out and then removed their rucksacks from the boot and heaving them onto their backs. Tina slammed the boot lid shut and locked the car before heading for the stile. Richard followed and as they climbed over Suzanne thought she saw Tina throw something into the grass verge. They climbed up the hill towards her and when they were within 20 yards .Tina called out cheerily,<br><br>
"Made it back then?" Suzanne waited until the student was next to her before she responded.<br><br>
"Yes," she said, trying to sound firm, "Now can I have my clothes please."<br><br>
"Well we’ll just have to check on the tin first won’t we." Tina laughed<br><br>
"Yes" Richard added, " Did your farmer friend put it back right."<br><br>
"I hope so," Suzanne muttered to herself.<br><br>
Tina and Richard then made a show of inspecting the position of the tin before they agreed that it was acceptable.<br><br>
"You can get up," Tina told the kneeling woman and then added sarcastically, "and you want to get something for your sunburn." Suzanne rose stiffly to her feet not bothering that the tin fell in the grass next to her.<br><br>
"My clothes?" she queried looking nervously at the two students.<br><br>
"They’re in the car boot " Richard informed her.<br><br>
"I don’t suppose you’d get them for me?" Suzanne asked, already knowing the answer.<br><br>
"No!" they answered in unison and then Tina continued,<br><br>
" We’re going on our way now so goodbye,"<br><br>
"Goodbye" Suzanne muttered under her breath as she watched the students walk down the hill towards the path. Once there they set off along it in the opposite direction to the stile. Suzanne wondered if they had ever been near a hospital at all.<br><br>
Suzanne looked at her car and took off down the hill towards it,<br><br>
"The sooner I’m dressed the better," she thought as she ran. In no time she was down the field and over the stile. With a feeling of relief she reached the boot but when she tried it, to her horror it was locked. Desperately she ran round to the side and tried the drivers door ,<br><br>
"Noooo" she wailed as she discovered this was locked as well and then beat her fists on the roof in frustration<br><br>
"The bastards" she cried in rage as she realised they had locked out of her car naked but then she remembered she had seen Tina throw something into the grass when she climbed the stile. Clutching at the hope that it might have been her keys she retraced her steps and tried to work out where they might have landed. Getting on her hands and knees she began to search the grass where she thought they might be. Two hours later and near to despair she at last found them .During that time she had not been disturbed by either hikers or road vehicles but the gathering gloom of the evening had made her search ever more difficult and there was always the nagging thought that her keys weren’t in the grass at all. She clutched them in her hand and with a whoop of joy ran to the car. Quickly unlocking the doors she ran round to the boot to get her clothes but as she raised the lid her spirits plummeted again as looking into the boot she saw that her clothes weren’t there. Hurriedly she looked into the car itself and saw that the only thing in there was her handbag and briefcase. In fact there was absolutely nothing in the entire car she could cover herself with. Cursing Tina and Richard once more she realised she would have to drive home naked and so got in and was soon driving carefully down the road. As it was dropping dark she got to her house uneventfully and swung into her drive. Extinguishing the car lights she then looked around very carefully to see if there were any of the neighbours taking an interest in her car. After several minutes she was satisfied there weren’t and so removing her keys from the car ignition she took a deep breath and scurried out of the car . One hand over her crotch and the other arm covering her chest she made a dash for the front door. Then crouching down on her doorstep she fumbled through her keys for the right one. She went through them with trembling hands, the thought of being seen uppermost in her mind , but failed to find it. Putting it down to nervousness she steeled herself and looked for it again but when then attempt failed she nearly panicked and looked round wildly. She could hardly hold her hands still but managed to calm down enough to go through the keys again. A feeling of despair came over her as she realised that it wasn’t there, evidently the students had removed it…………<br><br>

"It was a million to one fluke" 19 year old James Stockwood thought to himself as he finished copying the video tape and ejected it. Removing it from the recorder he went downstairs and out of the house only to return 2 minutes later minus the tape. Then taking, a deep breath, he picked up the phone and made a brief call before going upstairs to look surreptitiously out of his bedroom window.
<br><br>
A fortnight earlier it had been James's birthday and his parents had presented him with a video camera. James had wanted one for ages and was delighted, but like all things technical he had some difficulty mastering it. So when he came to use it one afternoon it was with some annoyance that , having left it on his bedroom window sill , he found it had been switched on all day and the batteries were flat. He put them on charge and went off to do something else. It wasn't until a week later when he was reviewing some of what he had videod that he got the shock of his life. As the tape came to the point where he thought it finished it suddenly cut to a shot of the house opposite,taken out of his bedroom window. Baffled, James left it running as he tried to figure out why he had this shot and it took couple of minutes to realise what had occurred and laughed.
<br><br>
"Twit" he said out loud to himself and was reaching to turn it off when he saw somebody walk up the drive .He paused ,out of curiosity, just to see what happened , as his camera had been pointing at the house of the biggest snob in the street, Ruth Stockton. James hated her, she had caused him nothing but grief all the time he had lived opposite her, she seemed to reckon that she was as cut above everybody else in the street and generally treated her neighbours with contempt. She had been particularly obnoxious towards James , ever since he had put a football through one of her windows several years ago. James knew she was some form of office manager, but exactly what he didn't know but she always dressed smartly and James couldn't help but notice her largish breasts when he did occasionally see her.
<br><br>
James watched the video as the mystery man approached her door, to the young observer the man was behaving furtively as he ran the doorbell. The door opened almost immediately and the man was ushered inside by Ruth. James watched a bit longer and was just about to lose interest again when there was movement in the bedroom. As he continued to stare at the screen his mouth fell open and he watched in disbelief as Ruth and the man embraced and then started to undress each other. Whilst the quality wasn't good it was clear enough that the prim and proper Ruth Stockton was having an affair of some sort behind her husband's back . James continued to watch but there was little to see and then suddenly he heard a key in the front door lock.
<br><br>
"Hello, James" his mother called as she entered. James quickly ejected the tape and hid it in a drawer'.
<br><br>
With his thoughts returning to the present James , peering out of his window, didn't have to wait long before he saw activity across the street. Ruth Stockton slowly opened her door, looked round quickly and then picked up a package off her doorstep. The package which had been placed there minutes earlier contained edited video highlights of Ruth's indiscretions from a fortnight earlier. The door closed and James decided to watch TV for a while, his nerves on edge as he thought what might happen if his plan went wrong. But then he imagined Ruth watching the tape and smiled as he thought about what she must be wondering to herself. He forced himself to leave it a full hour to give her both time to watch the tape and then to start sweating before he turned off the TV and went to the phone. Knowing that her husband was out he surmised that she must have watched the tape by now so with a trembling hand he quickly punched in her number and waited. After five rings the phone had still not been answered and he almost lost his bottle and put the handset down. But he forced himself not to and two rings later he heard Ruth's phone answered and a female voice say<br><br>
"Hello"<br><br>
"Ruth Stockton?" he enquired<br><br>
"Yes" she answered warily, "who is this?"<br><br>
"Never mind that" he replied , trying to sound firm but in reality he was virtually quaking in his boots, "I take it you've seen the tape.<br><br>
"Who is this," Ruth snapped angrily, "How dare you.."<br><br>
"SHUT UP AND LISTEN!" James shouted down his phone which caused Ruth to fall silent. He had expected this and was just following his plan.<br><br>
"The tape you have is a copy I have the original" he explained "and I am very tempted to make copies for your husband and all your neighbours. Richard heard a gasp and then there was a silence at the other end of the phone before in a small voice Ruth asked,<br><br>
"What do you want?"<br><br>
Be at the end of the road tomorrow a 6pm." James told her and put the phone down before Ruth could say anything. He breathed a huge sigh of relief and calming himself down returned to watching the TV. The next part of his plan was already worked out and he grinned as he thought about putting it into action. But conversely there were nagging doubts in his mind that it might all go wrong and he'd find himself in trouble.<br><br>
The following night Ruth Stockton was waiting at the end of her street at the appointed time. Her train home from work had been late and as a result she didn't have time to go home first, instead arriving at the road end straight from the station just three minutes prior to 6pm. Ever since the phone call the previous evening and her subsequent viewing of the tape her mind had been in turmoil and the worst thing was she had no idea who was doing this to her. Many times she mentally kicked herself for being so stupid. Her husband had been away , as fortunately he was currently, and she had invited one of her work colleagues , with whom she was having a brief fling, home. It had only lasted a few days, she thought better of it and in fact he only came to her house once and that one occasion was when they had been videod. She also kicked herself for not drawing the curtains to the bedroom. Now she was no doubt going to be blackmailed for her indiscretions, not only did her blackmailer threaten to give her husband a copy of the tape but also her neighbours.<br><br>
<br><br>
Ruth shivered , it was a dark breezy evening although not too cold for November. but her office attire was not particularly suited to standing on draughty street corners. Dressed in a charcoal grey business suit with a thigh length skirt she pulled her rather thin coat around her, not that it offered much protection , finishing only several inches below her waist. It was fine for her usual brisk walk from the station but not for standing around. Not liking high heels Ruth was shod in a pair of black flat shoes and being almost six foot tall she could get away with it. Ruth was not the best of people to work for normally but her staff at the office had, that day a particularly rough time as she had constantly thought about the tape.<br><br>
"Evening Mrs Stockton"<br><br>
A voice jolted her out of her musings and she looked round to see James, the boy who lived opposite, stood next to her leaning on his bike.<br><br>
"Evening" Ruth replied not disguising her contempt for James.<br><br>
"Waiting for someone?" James enquired<br><br>
"None of your business," Ruth snapped ,now annoyed , " Would you just go away"<br><br>
"OK" James said smiling and as he got onto his bike he added, " so you won't be wanting the video."<br><br>
"WHAT?" Ruth cried looking at the lad in horror, "You?"<br><br>
"Correct" James confirmed.<br><br>
"Give me the tape now you little pervert ." Ruth demanded angrily, "or I'll go straight to your father."<br><br>
"Go on then" James replied , "and I'll distribute the tape like I promised." Ruth glared at him her face going red with rage , although being dark James couldn't see this but after half a minute she knew she couldn't risk going to James's father so instead she asked,<br><br>
"What do you want," in the sternest voice she could muster, " I suppose its money you are after.<br><br>
"Nope," James replied simply and silence then resumed for 15 seconds until Ruth added,<br><br>
"Well what then?"<br><br>
"I have plans" James said grinning, "Do you know where St Nicholas's Church is?"<br><br>
"I'm not sure." Ruth replied warily<br><br>
"Well, in that case you can follow me" James informed her as he climbed onto his bike and set off along the pavement. As he rode he let the relief wash over him , his nonchalant behaviour and grins had all been an act in reality he had been petrified. He had spent a sleepless night worrying about the implications of what he was doing and earlier that day he had considered calling the whole thing off. He managed to force himself to keep the appointment and now was glad he had, Ruth Stockton was well and truly in his control.<br><br>
"Wait for me," Ruth called after him and set off walking at a brisk pace. James waited at the next junction for her.<br><br>
"Look," he said, "I haven't got all night, I suggest you run,"<br><br>
"Get lost" Ruth snapped, she wasn't going to be ordered about by a teenage boy.<br><br>
"I'll wait for you at the church then," James suggested, "if your not there five minutes after me then I'm going home and you don't get the tape."<br><br>
"OK,OK" Ruth conceded and as James set off once more she muttered,<br><br>
"Bastard," under her breath. Not having the faintest idea where the church was, religion not being her strong point, she set off after James. The narrow hem of her skirt severely hampered her progress and the best she could manage was a sort of trot. Despite her best efforts she soon fell behind and was greatly relieved to find James waiting for her a bit further up the road.<br><br>
"Trouble with the skirt," James asked.<br><br>
"Yes," Ruth answered only slightly out of breath, " its not designed for running," she explained trying to remain calm.<br><br>
"Then take it off." James told her in a matter of fact voice.<br><br>
"SOD OFF" Ruth cried angrily shocked by the suggestion.<br><br>
"I'm not waiting for you again," James warned her , "Its your choice, but don't forget I'll only be at the church 5 minutes.<br><br>
"Shit!" Ruth moaned, she knew when she was beaten and looked nervously up and down the road. Fortunately for her it was not a busy road and there were few cars and no pedestrians around. Even so she was still hesitant but, finally, with a glance at James who was leaning against his bicycle trying to look bored she went between two parked cars. Another nervous look around and then a pause as a lone car drove by preceded Ruth crouching down and wriggling out of her skirt. James was slightly annoyed that this spectacle was hidden from his view but the sight of an embarrassed Ruth re-emerging from between the cars holding her skirt in front of her more than made up for it.<br><br>
"I'll look after your skirt" James informed her and held out his hand. Ruth felt her face burn red as slowly she reached out and handed James her skirt and was glad it was dark. Once she had handed it over tugged her coat down as far as it would, but it didn't cover much at all. She cringed as a car passed by which momentarily lit them both up, long enough for James to see that she wore bright red panties. It was a strange feeling for Ruth as she stood in front of James with the chill of the night air on her bare thighs between where her hold up stockings finished and her jacket hem began. She dreaded what might happen next.<br><br>
"Off you go then," James said interrupting her thoughts, "I'll let you go first, take a left at the end of this road and I'll catch you up before you need to make another turn."<br><br>
"Do I have to?" Ruth pleaded not relishing the thought of having to run through the streets minus her skirt. Worse still it was just a teenager who was making her do it. "If you want the tape, you do" James responded and the added, "Off you go." Ruth sighed and set off in the direction indicated. James watched her go, admiring the sight before he looked at the skirt in his hand , shrugged to himself and then threw it over the garden hedge next to him.<br><br>
"That will give somebody something to think about," he thought to himself as he pedalled after Ruth.<br><br>
<br><br>
As promised he caught up with her and led the way to the church. Staying about thirty yard ahead of Ruth , James cycled at a steady pace, fast enough to keep Ruth going but not quick enough to lose her. He frequently looked over his shoulder , both to make sure he wasn't getting too far ahead and also because he liked the sight of Ruth running without her skirt. One thing was certain , she could go much quicker without it, whether this was because she could move more easily or because she wanted to get the ordeal over as fast as she could. James wasn't quite sure but either way he wasn't bothered.<br><br>
Ruth was reasonably fit and had little trouble keeping up with James. Her thoughts were more on not being seen and she realised that the sooner they got to the church the better so she pressed on, glad she wasn't wearing high heels.. Still deeply embarrassed she nearly died when she had to run past several people out walking. Only one person, a young man noticed her lack of a skirt and whistled at her. This caused Ruth to increase her pace until she was out of his sight. She was just beginning to tire when she saw that James had stopped ahead of her outside a church. Seconds later she came to a halt next to him and breathing deeply she didn't wait to be told but slipped through the gate into the churchyard and away from road and the possibility of being seen. She failed to notice that James no longer had her skirt with him as he wheeled his bike after her.<br><br>
Away from the road she felt less vulnerable so she challenged James,<br><br>
"Why are you doing this?" James thought for a moment , no longer nervous, and then answered,<br><br>
"Because the opportunity arose and also because I want to get my own back on you.<br><br>
"Own back?" Ruth asked, mystified.<br><br>
"Yes," James explained, "Ever since I accidentally broke your window you've treated me like dirt ."<br><br>
"I'm sorry", Ruth said trying to placate him.<br><br>
"Also," James, went on, "you are probably the biggest snob in the street and I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to take you down a peg or two."<br><br>
"I'm not a snob," Ruth said indignantly , not really believing that this lad was talking to her like this, but very concerned as to where events were leading. James said nothing for a few seconds as he gazed at Ruth's ample chest heaving up and down in the gloom of the churchyard. Then he suddenly said,<br><br>
"Take your coat off."<br><br>
"Why," Ruth asked thrown off guard by James's sudden change of direction<br><br>
"Because I say so and because you have to if you want the tape" James told her in a very firm voice.<br><br>
In fact a voice that was firm enough in its tone for her not to try arguing but instead do as she was told. She unbuttoned it and took it off in a short space of time before placing it over a gravestone that was conveniently situated on her left.<br><br>
"Now the jacket," James told her as soon as she faced him again.<br><br>
"But'" Ruth tried to say<br><br>
"NOW!" James snapped and Ruth began to slip out of it without protest.<br><br>
She put it on top of her coat and shivered in the night air as she turned back to James, folding her arms as she did so. James looked at the half dressed woman in front of him and once again his attention was drawn to her breasts. He could not resist asking ,<br><br>
"What size are your tits?"<br><br>
"None of your business," Ruth snapped with a sudden flush of anger at being asked such a personal question by this youth. This was despite the fact she stood in front of him minus half her clothes.<br><br>
"Wrong answer," James told her, putting on a cold voice, "Take off your blouse"<br><br>
"N..no, I'm sssorry," Ruth stammered realising her error, "They're 36D"<br><br>
"That better, politeness costs nothing, "but you can still take off the blouse"<br><br>
"Oh please, No." Ruth wailed in despair.<br><br>
"You do want the tape?" James asked<br><br>
Ruth didn't reply, her head slumped forward in defeat and she started to fumble with the buttons on her blouse. She slowly worked her way down until they were all undone and then she undid the ones on the cuffs. James didn't rush her, he was enjoying every moment of humiliating the woman who had been the bane of his life for the past few years. Without further prompting Ruth slowly removed the blouse and placed it with the rest of her clothes. She didn't turn back this time, instead staying facing the gravestone and rubbing her arms in a vain attempt to keep warm. Despite the lack of light James could see that like her knickers her bra was red.
<br><br>
"Face me" James ordered and watched with delight as the woman reluctantly turned towards him.<br><br>
"Put your arms by your side." He then added<br><br>
Ruth did as she was told but said in a small voice as she did so,<br><br>
"Haven't you seen enough,"<br><br>
"Do you think I'm going to stop now?" James laughed<br><br>
"Oh please," Ruth begged,<br><br>
"No chance" the teenager tormented her further, "Lets see these 36D's then.<br><br>
Ruth pushed her shoulders back and thrust her chest out.<br><br>
"No" James laughed , "I want to see all of them.<br><br>
Ruth froze chest still stuck out.<br><br>
"You mean'" she started but failed to finish.<br><br>
"Yep" James told her, "dispense with the bra"<br><br>
Now visibly shivering with the cold Ruth moaned and slumped her shoulders.<br><br>
"Do you want the tape," James asked her when she failed to make any further movement.<br><br>
"Yes" she mumbled sadly as she reached behind her back to unclip her bra. Several moments fumbling followed before she succeeded and wriggled out of the garment trying to cover as much as she could of her naked chest from James's gaze with her arms. Once it was off she carefully draped it over the gravestone upon which the rest of her clothes, except her skirt of course , rested.<br><br>
<br><br>
With eyes now more accustomed to the darkness James was able to see his neighbour quite clearly and took a moment to gaze at her cringing in front of him.<br><br>
"Time to lose the shoes and stockings," James told her and without protest she started to kick off her shoes. Removing them was not going to reveal any more flesh to James so Ruth saw little point in arguing. She pushed her shoes to the base of the gravestone with her foot and then set about peeling her right stocking down. This turned out to be highly amusing for James watching her lowering her stockings with one hand whilst trying to keep her breasts covered with the other. It was a hopeless task and on several occasions one breast or the other swung free and James was treated to the sight of her frantic efforts to preserve her modesty . When she finally got it off Ruth put it on top of the rest of her clothes and repeated the exercise with the other stocking. Once again her breasts refused to play the game and kept escaping from behind the arm that was supposed to be hiding them. James was almost disappointed when she placed her second stocking with the first but before he could say anything further Ruth said in almost a whisper,<br><br>
<br><br>
"Please let me keep my panties."<br><br>
"Of course you can keep them," James told her and her relief was all too evident at his seemingly generous gesture.<br><br>
"But," he continued after a brief pause, " I'll keep the tape if you keep them." Anguish immediately replaced the look of relief on her face. She was now facing the prospect of stripping entirely naked in front of a teenager and once again cursed the indiscretion that had got her into this mess in the first place.<br><br>
"Time to make up your mind" James said jolting her from her thoughts, "What's it to be?"<br><br>

Once again Ruth knew that in practice she had no real choice and with a last despairing look at James wriggled her panties off of her hips and down her thighs before letting them drop to her ankles. This was accomplished one handed, as with the stockings, although this time she managed to keep the breasts confined. She carefully stepped out of them and quickly put the red panties on top of the rest of her clothes. As she placed her free hand over her crotch the moon chose that moment to come out from behind the clouds and bathe her in white light.
<br><br>
She wished the ground would open up and swallow her up as she stood front of James, totally naked and acutely aware of it. She squirmed with embarrassment as she looked at the pile of clothes lying over the grave stone next to her and wished she was wearing them. Instead she had no choice but to try and cover her body from James's gaze with her hand and arms. She didn't really notice the cold and the fact that her teeth were chattering as with one arm across her breasts and her other arm covering her crotch she half crouched in front of him feeling utterly humiliated .James on the other hand was enjoying every minute of watching her discomfort, he had managed , by pure chance, to reduce the biggest snob in his street to a state of naked humiliation and not surprisingly he was grinning from ear to ear.
<br><br>
"Get on your knees" James suddenly ordered and Ruth slowly struggled to do as instructed whilst trying to keep herself covered. Eventually she managed only to be told<br><br>
"Put your hands on your head." By James.<br><br>
When she didn't move he repeated the order,<br><br>
"Put your hands on your head" this time more sternly and then watched as most reluctantly Ruth removed her hands from her chest and placed them on her head. Her face burned with shame but to her horror James then said,<br><br>
"Get your knees apart,"<br><br>
This time she looked at him with pleading eyes and managed to whisper,<br><br>
"Please, no"<br><br>
"You want the tape?" James asked in reply and after a small pause she bowed her head and shuffled her knees a few inches apart.<br><br>
"Further" James snapped and mortified at the thought of what she was doing Ruth forced herself to spread herself a bit more.<br><br>
"Keep going" James encouraged her and the wretched woman stifled a sob and moved her knees even further away from each other. A last James was satisfied that she could get them no further apart and told her to stop. He then took his time to admire the woman in front of him who was now lewdly displaying herself. He took his time and even walked round her a couple of times. Ruth just stared straight in front during the time James inspected her, she just tried to reassure herself that the whole escapade would soon be over.
<br><br>
When James decided he had seen enough he picked up her clothes from the gravestone and came round to her front . Crouching down he piled them in a heap in front of her before retrieving her shoes from the foot of the gravestone and placing them on top of the pile.. Then, as Ruth watched in puzzlement he produced a small tin of liquid from his pocket and tipped it over the heap. Standing up he threw the now empty tin behind him and looked down at the naked woman.
<br><br>
"Just one more thing and the tape is yours" he said<br><br>
"OK" Ruth mumbled just wanting to end the ordeal over and get out of her current position, "what do I have to do?"<br><br>
James reached into his pocket once more and threw a lighter in her direction and when it landed more or less between her spread knees he said,<br><br>
"Set fire to your clothes"<br><br>
"You can't be serious" Ruth cried.<br><br>
"Yes I am" James replied.<br><br>
"I won't do it" Ruth told him, " I've done enough, I'm going to get dressed and leave now" and with that she started to reach for her clothes.<br><br>
"STOP" James said sharply which caused Ruth to freeze.<br><br>
"Your clothes are going to burn" he told her in a menacing voice, " I poured lighter fluid on them so they will burn easily. I can have them on fire before you could get one single item back on, but if I do I'll distribute the tape."<br><br>
Ruth looked indecisively at her clothes for a moment then up at James.<br><br>
"Well?" he asked "What's it to be?"<br><br>
Ruth still did not move and looked back at her clothes once more.<br><br>
Nothing happened for thirty seconds, the air heavy with tension until Ruth reached down between her legs and with a trembling hand picked up the lighter. Her hand was shaking so much as she flicked it and it wasn't until the fourth attempt that she got a flame. She started slightly as it flared up to nearly a 3 inch flame in front of her face, James had been very considerate and adjusted it so it wouldn't blow out. She then paused staring at the roaring lighter before moaning,<br><br>
<br><br>
"Oh my God" and reaching forward applied the lighter to her clothes. The lighter fluid had soaked in well and in seconds they were all alight and blazing merrily. Ruth watched the flames with a kind of morbid fascination until a thought jolted her.<br><br>
"How do I get home," she suddenly asked looking over the fire to James. He shrugged in response,<br><br>
"That's your problem, but I will keep my word and the tape will be delivered to you tomorrow."<br><br>
"But I've nothing to wear, how can I go home like this." Ruth wailed looking down at the remains of her clothes which were now little more that a pile of smouldering ashes with two pieces of gooey plastic in the middle that used to be her shoes.<br><br>
"Like I said your problem" James repeated and without further ado he got onto his bicycle and before Ruth could protest he rode off and left her still on her knees.<br><br>
<br><br>
It was in the evening about week later that there was a knock at James's front door. Being the only one home he had to answer it himself and was somewhat startled to see Ruth standing there. He had given her the tape as promised and since then had only seen her twice , on both occasions she had not surprisingly ignored him. To see her on his doorstep now had him momentarily lost for words. Ruth found her voice first,<br><br>
"I know you are alone so can I come in" she asked nervously,<br><br>
"Er yes," James answered and stood back as she entered at the same time noticing she was clutching a video tape.<br><br>
"What can I do for you" he asked trying to sound relaxed as he closed the door and turned to face him.<br><br>
"Here" Ruth said and thrust the tape out at him.<br><br>
"What's this?" James queried declining to take the proffered tape.<br><br>
"Its the tape of me" Ruth blurted out, "I want you to have it back."<br><br>
"What for?" James asked incredulously<br><br>
Ruth blushed and looked at the floor,<br><br>
"Well?" James pressed her after a few moments<br><br>
"B..BB.Because'" she stuttered, "I..I w..ant you to make me earn it back"<br><br>
"Are you serious?" James said in a state of near shock"<br><br>
"Yes," she whispered looking at the floor.<br><br>
James thought about it for a few seconds and then said,<br><br>
"What the hell" and snatched the tape from her hand. But then he stopped and said,<br><br>
"Last chance, you've got 60 seconds to change your mind and ask for the tape back , after that its too late."<br><br>
Back in control of himself once more James looked at his watch for a minute whilst Ruth stared nervously around the room and wrung her hand in front of her.<br><br>
"Times up" James announced , "Wait here" and with that he quickly went upstairs to his bedroom to secrete the tape. He felt on top of the world as he came down the stairs but also knew it was getting late and his parents would soon be returning. He walked past Ruth and into the kitchen but soon returned holding a bin bag.<br><br>
"Remove all your clothes and put them in this," he said, and held the bag out to her. Ruth took it and slowly removed her shoes<br><br>
"Hurry up," James snapped, "Unless you'd like to meet my parents."<br><br>
Ruth started and looked up at him. "Yes, they'll be home soon." James informed her.<br><br>
This spurred Ruth on and very soon she was stuffing her knickers, the last item she had removed into the bag.<br><br>
"Put it down, " he told her when she was done and Ruth dropped it by her side.<br><br>
"I'll be in touch" he told her as he grabbed her by the arm opened the front door and propelled her out into the night. As soon as he had slammed the door behind her, he went up to his bedroom, picking up the bag of Ruth's clothes on the way and was looking out of his window in time to see the naked woman scurry across the road towards her house. James smiled to himself, he was definitely in for some fun'.<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Sheila Jenkins sat in her office and watched the closed circuit TV monitor sat on the desk in front of her and her heart began to pound as she watched events unfold. Sheila had been deputy manager of this particular supermarket for nearly six months, during which time she had done her job well and earned the respect of the staff having gained a reputation of being firm but fair.. She got on well with her boss, a man by the name of Martin Clark, and he had already let it be known that it would only be a matter of time before she became manager of a store in her own right. But as she watched the monitor in growing horror she knew that her future could well be on the line.
<br><br>
As deputy manager part of her duties included being responsible for the bakery, as being a big store the bread was baked on the premises and she had always thought she had an excellent team working in it. The bakery supervisor, Amanda Taylor was an extremely efficient woman and made sure things ran like clockwork and seemed to be able to get her team of three other women to do whatever was needed. In fact Sheila rarely interfered with the workings of the bakery knowing that Amanda had things under control. Then, about a month ago Head office sent a memo to the effect that the bakery at Sheila's store was using more flour and other ingredients that any other store and could she provide an explanation. Sheila dismissed it as the typical sort of thing one gets from a pen pusher at head office and as they were about to embark on a stock take put it in a drawer to deal with at a later date. She then promptly forgot about it and only remembered when another slightly more insistent memo had arrived, this time detailing her stores usage of ingredients and comparing it with other stores. Having studied the figures Sheila had to concede that head office did have a point and she decided to have a chat with Amanda later that day.
<br><br>
She never got to the chat as she slipped up to her office for a cup of coffee at about seven o'clock that evening and whilst sat at her desk drinking it she started to fiddle with the newly upgraded cctv system part of which involved having monitors in the managers offices. She was no expert with the things and it was purely by chance she ended up looking at the bakery which surprised her as she didn't know there was even a camera there and for several minutes watched as the bakery staff removed a large quantity of freshly baked bread from one of the ovens. Soon growing bored she switched to a view of the main store but then, about 15 seconds later, a thought struck her and she flicked back to the bakery.
<br><br>
"Why are the making bread a couple of hours before the store shuts?" she said out loud to herself and then watched as Amanda and her staff loaded the not insubstantial amount of bread onto a trolley and carefully covered it over. Amanda herself then wheeled the trolley out the back of the bakery and into the warehouse area. Sheila frantically pressed buttons on her console to try and find a view of the warehouse. Finally she got one and was horrified to see Amanda helping a man to load all the bread into the back of a van. Once it was all loaded the man handed something to Amanda which Sheila assumed to be money and seconds later the van drove off. Amanda looked round furtively before stuffing the money into her bra and then wheeling the trolley back to the bakery.
<br><br>
Sheila sat dumbfounded, just staring at the screen as numerous thoughts flashed through her brain. Upper most was the feeling of betrayal, she had always trusted Amanda but had now just discovered she and her staff had a nice little sideline going at the stores expense. She was about to phone the police and hand the matter over to them when it occurred to her that the whole affair would reflect badly on her and most likely she could forget any further advancement of her career. Calming herself she began to think hard and came to the conclusion that she was better off dealing with the matter herself and keeping the lid on it. She was also equally determined to teach Amanda and her staff a lesson they wouldn't forget. Picking up the phone she made an internal call to the bakery and curtly told Amanda that she wanted to see her and the bakery staff once the store had closed. Amanda asked why and Sheila simply said,<br><br>
"Wait and see," before putting the phone down.
<br><br>
Two hours later there was a knock at the door of Sheila's office.
 <br>"Come in," Sheila called and led by Amanda the four women walked in still in their bakery uniforms which in Amanda's case consisted of a white knee length cotton overall/dress. Amanda herself was very self confident and outgoing 27 year old  which made her ideal for the job she was doing. She was of medium height and possessed short dark hair. The other three entered quickly behind Amanda, they were dressed in the standard uniforms, like Amanda's only theirs were light blue in colour. Sheila knew that due to the heat in the bakery they very rarely wore much under these uniforms. First through the door, after Amanda  was Julie Smith, the oldest of all of them at 43 . Despite this she had lost none of her looks and was known to work out at a local gym to keep in trim although the 5ft tall with  curly blonde hair did have a reputation for having a fiery temper. She also had a rather unruly 18 year old daughter. Following her was Anne Harrison a 25 year old, who at 4ft 6" was the shortest of them all but along with her long jet back hair she possessed both an ample chest and backside  The last into the office was Angela Scott the tall   blonde haired 19 year old trainee who was as thin as she was tall. She had proved to be extremely shy in the couple of months she had been at the store but was nonetheless a hard worker. All four women wore the obligatory white hats as required by the hygiene regulations and those with long hair had it tucked under these hats. In addition they all wore their name badges on their left breasts in line with company policy. As the nervous looking Angela closed the door behind herself  Amanda made for the chair in front of the desk and was somewhat startled when Sheila rebuffed her with,
<br>"I didn't say you could sit." 
 <br>She managed to maintain  her composure and went to stand with her staff. Sheila looked at the four of them stood opposite her and then produced the memo. She read it out and then said,
<br>"Can you explain this please?" 
<br>"Its probably a mix up," Amanda tried to explain, having studied it for a moment but was interrupted by Sheila,
<br>"I thought that at first but now I've got other ideas"
<br>"Such as?" Amanda snapped back none too pleasantly as the other three looked worried.
<br>"Well perhaps I should tell you that I discovered our new security system has a camera in the bakery and tonight I saw some interesting things."
<br>There was silence as the four standing women looked aghast which immediately indicated to Sheila that all of them knew exactly what had been going on.
<br>"What exactly did you see?" Amanda finally managed to ask after several moments of uneasy silence.
<br>"Lets say, a substantial quantity of bakery products was seen leaving via the back door." Sheila answered giving Amanda a cold stare .
<br>"Oh" was all Amanda could manage in reply, she and the others knew they had been caught red handed,  their  little scheme to make some extra cash on the  side had just landed them in serious hot water.
"I suppose I have no alternative but to call the police," Sheila added a moment later.
There was a gasp from one of the women and Amanda manage to utter a quiet,
"No." which Sheila heard.
Sitting back in her chair she said, 
" Why don't you tell me what has been going on."
<br>Amanda knew when they were beaten and realising that protests of innocence would be futile took a deep breath and began to speak. She described how she had been approached by a man offering her money if she produced some bread for him. At first Amanda declined but the man came back on several occasions and as well as being persistent he upped the money. This caused Amanda to  give the matter some serious thought and she eventually concluded that she could get away with it but she would of course need the rest of the staff in on the deal. So one evening she got them all on one side and carefully explained the deal to them . To her surprise she found they were all in agreement although in hind sight it was just before Christmas and the thought of a bit extra money was all the more tempting. So that was that and she struck a deal with the man and things had been going fine until now. 
<br>On finishing her account Amanda looked at her shoes unable to look Sheila in the eye. Sheila noticed this and saw that the others were also looking extremely uneasy and looking away from her. 
<br>"So who was this man?" Sheila asked breaking the silence. 
<br>"I have  no idea" Amanda answered looking up. Sheila could tell she was telling the truth and looked again at the four women. They all knew that their jobs, futures and the possibility of a criminal record   lay in Sheila's hands. What they didn't know , or at least Sheila hoped they hadn't worked out, was that if she blew the whistle on them then her career would probably be over as well.
<br>Sheila sat in silence and maintaining an outward appearance of composure and looked from one woman to the next for a good minute or so. At last she spoke. 
<br>"You have a choice ladies" she began in an authoritative voice, "I can call the police now or you can let me deal with the matter and accept an alternative course of action." Without waiting for Sheila to go on there was a chorus of agreement to accepting Sheila's alternative.
<br>"Are you sure?" Sheila asked again and for a second time got four agreements.
<br>"Very well, Amanda stay  here, the rest of you wait outside" 
<br>There were questioning looks but it seemed better than police involvement so Anne, Angela and Julie filed out of the office closing the door behind them.
<br>Amanda looked up at Sheila with a weak smile on her face,
<br>"It's very good of you to give us this chance," she said trying to be friendly.
<br>"Don't thank me yet," Sheila replied stoically, "you might not be so grateful later."
<br>"What have you got in mind then?" Amanda asked uneasily.
<br>"You'll find out in good time," was all the answer she got. 
<br>Amanda said nothing more and Sheila decided to waste  no time and looking straight at Amanda sternly said,
<br>"Strip"
<br>"What," Amanda gasped not believing her ears.
<br>"Strip." Sheila repeated slightly more forcefully
<br>"No way," Amanda retorted defiantly and folded her arms
<br>"Have it your way," Sheila sighed and reached for the phone.
<br>"Err..Hang on" the supervisor said hastily and Sheila paused, 
<br>"Do you really mean take off my clothes?"
<br>"Yes" Sheila said
<br>"Oh, but why?"
<br>"Because you agreed to accept my alternative," Sheila explained her hand hovering over the phone.
<br>"You never said anything about stripping." She said angrily
<br>"You never asked." Sheila replied
<br>"And if I don't you'll call the police?" Amanda said nastily.
<br>"Correct," Sheila confirmed. 
<br>"Isn't there something else we can do," Amanda asked looking for a way out.
<br>"No" Sheila replied, "Strip or I ring the Police"
<br>"You rotten bitch." Amanda said knowing she was beaten and struggling to control her anger .
<br>Sheila just smiled.
<br>"O Rats" Amanda groaned and kicked off her shoes. She  was not shy and was determined to maintain as much dignity as possible so she began to unbutton the front of her white overall which took some time as they went all the way to her waist. She slipped deftly out of it and allowed it to drop to the floor. This left her clad only in her white lacy 36B bra and matching panties with of course her bakery hat on her head. The hat was quickly pulled off to reveal her short dark hair before  the supervisor  reached up and unclipped her front fasting bra. Pulling it apart her breasts spilled out and at the same time the money she had earlier stuffed in her bra fell out.. The bra was dropped on the ground and swiftly she yanked her knickers down and kicked them off. Not one for modesty she stood naked in front of Sheila with her hands on her hips breasts swinging free and her neatly trimmed pubic hair on display. She virtually spat.
 <br>"Now what?" at Sheila.
<br>The seated woman was  a little taken aback by this but didn't show it and instead she said,
<br>"Go and stand facing that wall and put you hands on your head.". 
<br>This took Amanda by surprise and caused her to blush for the first time. It wasn't many weeks earlier she had made her own children do the same, only they were clothed.
<br>"Find that a bit embarrassing do you?" Sheila asked sensing her discomfort.
<br>"Yes," was all Amanda could say in reply, her defiance somewhat dissipated, as Sheila pointed to the wall and said, 
<br>"Good"
<br>As the naked woman shuffled across the office Sheila got up from her chair went round her desk and picked up the money that had fallen from Amanda's bra. She put it on her desk and then went over to the door. She pulled it open smartly and curtly ordered,
<br>"Julie, come in."
<br>At 43 Julie was the oldest of them all but at 5ft with her curly blonde hair she was still an attractive woman. She entered the office and Sheila closed the door behind her. As the deputy manager returned to her seat Julie couldn't help but notice the pile of clothes on the floor in front of the desk. She looked round the room and with a gasp her hand flew to her mouth  as she set eyes on her supervisor's naked form.
<br>She looked back at Sheila  eyes as wide as saucers, hand still over mouth.
<br>"W..What tt..the?" she stammered in disbelief
<br>Sheila was sure she saw Amanda's naked buttocks clench with the humiliation of her position and just to rub it in she said, 
<br>"Tell Julie why you are like that, Amanda"
<br>Between gritted teeth and feeling utterly ridiculous Amanda managed to say,
<br>"This is the alternative to the police." And then felt her face burn red.
<br>"Not all of it, actually," Sheila corrected her, "But more of that later."
<br>"I don't have to do that do I? " Julie asked with a flash of her short temper, " because I refuse.".
<br>"You do unless you'd like me to call the police"
 <br>Julie seethed  as she slowly looked over had the naked Amanda.
<br>"There must be a law against this" she snarled turning back to Sheila who promptly answered, 
<br>"There probably is and there most certainly is against theft."
<br>Julie like Amanda several minutes before her knew she was in a no win situation and grudgingly conceded,
<br>"OK you win," as she pulled her bakery hat from her head and angrily shook her hair free. Looking down she saw Amanda's discarded clothes close to her feet and dropped her hat on top of them. She kicked off her shoes and left them where they fell and then reached behind her neck. Sheila heard a zip being pulled down and watched with a feeling of growing power as Julie stripped in front of her. With a considerable amount of wriggling Julie got her arms out of the sleeves before allowing the overall/dress to fall. The 5ft tall Julie was quite broad across both the shoulders and the hips. As a result the garment stopped at her waist and Julie had to help it over her hips before it finally fell to the floor. Standing in front of Sheila in a light blue set of bra and knickers Sheila noted that like Amanda , Julie's legs were bare, no doubt due to the heat of the bakery. Julie's temper had deserted her as the dress came off, she had always been self conscious about her rather plump bottom and it dawned on her that she was going to have to display it totally in the next few minutes. She sniffed  before reaching behind her back to undo her bra. Seconds later her 34B breasts with only a slight trace of a sag were on full display as the bra dropped to the ground.
<br>Julie froze with her thumbs in the waistband of her knickers dreading taking them off to reveal her backside.  When she didn't move Sheila looked up at her and said.
<br>"Problem?"
<br>"I can't take them off" Julie nearly cried
<br>"Amanda," Sheila called raising her voice, " Tell her what happens if she doesn't"
<br>"You call the police," Amanda replied sadly still facing the wall.
<br>Julie reluctantly  slipped her knickers down and blushed as red as a beetroot as she did so. She stood with them round her ankles both hands covering her crotch  staring at the ground. 
<br>"Go and stand next to Amanda," Sheila ordered and watched as she turned and stepping out of her knickers made her way to join her supervisor. As she turned she gave Sheila brief glimpse of her luxuriant blonde pubic hair . By the time that she got to the wall next to her supervisor Sheila could not fail to notice her rather plump arse. Unbidden she put her hands on her head and stood silently. Sheila's confidence was growing as she got up again and headed for the door and she opened it and called the 25 year old Anne in. 
Anne nervous at the best of times came in and almost immediately spotted her colleagues. Her mouth fell wide open and she stood immobile as she took in the sight of the naked pair. Sheila went and perched on the end of her desk and folding her arms looked at Anne. 
<br>"I suppose you are wondering what has happened?" she said. Anne slowly nodded, still bewildered. 
<br>"Well, that" she explained pointing at Amanda and Julie, " is the alternative to the police."
<br>"Oh" was all Anne could manage in a tiny voice so Sheila continued,
<br>"So would you be so kind as to take off your clothes and join them."
<br>Much to Sheila surprise Anne immediately started to unzip her overall albeit rather slowly. Sheila had expected some resistance from Anne but none was forthcoming. She continued at this slow pace just staring to the front as the overall fell to the floor and she stepped out of her shoes at the same time as she stepped out of the dress. This left her 34C breasts encased in a rather matronly cotton bra which was built for functionality and not style. Her knickers were  of a similar design, both items being in plain white. At 4ft 6" she was the smallest of the women except for the very slightly shorter Sheila. With trembling hands she undid her bra catch and let it slide down her arms and drop to the ground and them pulled her knickers down  and stepped out of them. She turned to make her way to join the other two, but Sheila  stopped her.
<br>"Haven't you forgotten something?"
<br>Puzzled Anne looked up and down her naked body.
<br>"Try your head," Sheila advised and without a pause Anne reached up and pulled off her hat. This cause her long jet black hair to cascade down to the middle of her back as she made her way to stand next to Amanda.. Her hands went to her head without a word from Sheila who sat on the desk and shrugged  to herself. She couldn't really believe how little resistance Anne had put up. Saving herself another trip to the door she instead called,
<br>"Angela get in here!"
<br>The door slowly open and the timid trainee walked in, Sheila could see that she was already trembling and she didn't even know what was happening yet. As she pushed the door shut behind herself she set eyes on the considerable mound of clothes in front of Sheila's desk. She looked up at Sheila and asked,
 <br>"Whose are those?"
<br>Sheila said nothing but pointed in the direction of the  others. Angela looked to where her boss was pointing and gasped in horror at the sight that greeted her.  Wildly she looked back at Sheila with wide questioning eyes.
<br>" Its the alternative to the police," Sheila explained repeating herself yet again. 
<br>"O my god" the shocked 19 year old managed to say and then it hit her.
<br>"I don't have to do that, do I?" she asked desperately.
<br>"It's that or the police" Sheila said   glad that she was the last, things were starting to get somewhat repetitive.
<br>"No way," Angela snapped close to tears.
<br>"I really think you should" Sheila suggested, "think of the others.
<br>But Angela was adamant,
<br>"I'm keeping my clothes on" she announced and folded her arms. At the same time she began to pout. Sheila could see she wasn't going to co-operate and was about to threaten her with the police when Amanda spoke up,
<br>"Angela, you've got to do it, we have."
<br>"I can't" Angela pleaded still close to tears
<br>"Angela, if you don't we are all in even bigger trouble," Amanda explained still facing the wall hands on head.
<br>"I'm not" the six foot tall girl snapped
<br>"If you don't get those clothes off," Angela suddenly hissed in a menacing voice, " I will personally strip you." Which caused Angela to look round at her supervisor in wide eyed amazement. Not believing what she had just heard she could only manage to stammer,
<br>"You wouldn't?"
<br>"I would." Came the reply
<br>Angela looked back at Sheila who added,
<br>"I would do as she says." And then watched as Angela churned the options over in her mind. Finally she concluded like the others before her, that she had no real choice .
<br>"OK" she whispered in defeat and reached down  to remove her shoes. The hat followed allowing her shoulder length blonde hair to fall free. Sheila could tell she was extremely self conscious as   painfully slowly she fumbled to unzip her dress. For a moment Sheila felt a tinge of  sympathy for her but then reminded herself that Angela was as guilty as the rest of them . At long last she managed to undo the dress and allow it to fall to the floor. It passed easily over her boyish hips to show off a pair of  white cotton panties and a white bra which contained her small breasts. At this point she started to become agitated and reached behind her to undo her bra but then dropped her hands to her sides and quickly said,
<br>"Please let me keep my underwear."
<br>"No" Sheila replied firmly
<br>"Oh please" Angela  begged wringing her hands together tears in her eyes.
<br>"Angela!" came the stern voice of Amanda from across the room
<br>The blonde sniffed to herself and hurriedly undid her bra and let it drop away before immediately covering her cheat. She wasn't quite fast enough to prevent Sheila from seeing what she was trying to hide. A glance to the floor at Angela's feet confirmed it for Sheila as she saw that the girls discarded bra was padded. Angela was in fact completely flat chested!
<br>"And the knickers" Sheila ordered with a knowing smile and then watched as the desperate trainee wriggled her knickers down whilst still trying to cover her chest. As they came down Sheila got another surprise as she saw that Angela had a shaven crotch. At last she was naked and stood trying to cover herself  until Sheila said
<br>"Go and join the others." And she scurried to join them.
<br>"Hands!" Sheila called out when Angela's hands remained in front of her and slowly they were placed on her head.
<br> Sheila looked at the four naked women stood up against the wall of the office with their hands on their heads. She smiled to herself  as she realised she was enjoying the embarrassment of the bakery women.
<br>"I suppose you want to know what happens next?" she said continuing to humiliate them and in reply received mumbled reply's indicating that they would. Standing as they were, the four naked women were dreading what was going to happen but they consoled themselves with the thought that it was better than the police or at least they hoped it was! 
<br>"Well, I'll tell you in a moment," Sheila told them as she opened the bottom draw of her desk and rummaged around in  it for a few seconds before locating what she was looking for. She pulled out a roll of brown parcel tape out and then pushed her chair back and stood up all in one movement before going round her desk and over to the women. She stopped behind Amanda and putting her mouth close to the supervisor's ear said,
<br>"Since you are the ringleader in all of this, I think you should have a little handicap."
<br>Amanda didn't reply but just stood there motionless. 
<br>"Put your hands behind your back." Sheila ordered and slowly Amanda did as she was told.
<br>Sheila pulled a long length of the tape and crossing Amanda's wrists then proceeded to bind them together. She used a large  amount of the tape and when she was satisfied that Amanda was well bound she snapped off the tape and set off back to her desk.  She sat down and was just about to inform the women as to what she intended them to do when the door to her office flew open and in walked Martin Clark her boss. 
<br>"Sheila, I'm glad your still here," he began briskly, " I've got thi'.What the ?"he then exclaimed as he saw four naked women standing against his deputy's office wall.
<br>Fortunately he was a man not easily flustered and he quickly regained his calm which was about the same time as three of the women screamed and tried to cover themselves as they desperately  pressed up against the wall. Amanda hands tied just screamed. Sheila's heart missed a beat when he appeared but she was also one not to panic and she quickly moved to regain the upper hand. 
<br>"Shut up and stand still" she shouted at them, "and get those hands back on your heads," and then added as an after thought, " Those of you that can."
<br>"Can I have a word outside, Martin?" she said rising from her chair again.
<br>"I think we'd better." Martin replied grimly and led the way out of the office.
Sheila followed, noting that the women had returned to their previous positions and closed the door behind her. Turning to Martin she said,
<br>"I can explain,"  
<br>"Go on" Martin replied leaning on the wall of the corridor and folding his arms, the sight of what he had just seen firmly etched in his mind.  Sheila, who decided the only way forward was to tell the truth ,  then nervously went on to tell him what had happened only she altered the story to say that she had done what she had done to protect the good name of the store instead of saving her career. As she finished Martin leant back and sighed, he was no idiot and knew exactly why Sheila hadn't called the police. 
<br>"You didn't call the police, because you were more worried about your career?" he said in a matter of fact voice. Sheila's stammered denial and red face confirmed it for him
<br>"You'd have done the same think in my shoes," she blurted 
<br>"What,? Strip my bakery staff naked and then'. anyhow what were you going to make them do?" he finished suddenly curious.
<br>" I was going to kick them out of the store like they are now," Sheila answered sheepishly before going on to explain the rest of her plan for them  
<br>"Right" Martin said rather amazed that his deputy could come up with something like that.
<br>"But I suppose that's all out the window" Sheila continued and turned towards the office door. "I'll go and tell them to get dressed."
<br>"Hang on a minute." Martin said quickly causing Sheila to stop, her hand on the door knob. She turned back to him. Martin was a quick thinker and what Sheila had proposed quite appealed to him. There was also the fact that things had gone too far down the line now, explaining the dishonest dealings of the bakery staff would be difficult enough but the fact that the deputy manager had made them strip naked and proposed to further humiliate them would be virtually impossible to get away with.
<br>"We'll go with your plan" he announced to Sheila, "but there will be one change."
<br>"What's that?" Sheila asked,
<br>" You go and tell them what is expected of them and I'll join you in a minute" Martin replied without answering the question and promptly strode off down the corridor. 
<br>Sheila shrugged to herself and went back into the office. The naked four hadn't moved whilst she had been out but all noticeably flinched as she re-entered the room. Sheila glanced at them and then returned to the chair behind her desk. She paused a moment before saying,
<br>"Turn round and face me." and then watched as the women did so. Angela tried to cover her chest with her arms.
<br>"Keep your hands on your head, Angela," Sheila rebuked her and the young woman's shot back on her head.
<br>"Right then," Sheila began leaning back in the chair and looking at the four bakery staff, "I've had a chat with Martin and he's quite happy with what I am proposing." 
<br>Sheila noticed the four women's shoulders slump slightly, and rightly suspected that they had all been thinking that Martin's intervention  meant they could all get dressed and go home.
<br>Sheila was about to continue when Martin opened the door and entered.
<br>"Don't move ladies," he announced pre-empting any attempts of the women to hide themselves from his gaze. Sheila noticed her was carrying a long handle brush , obviously obtained from the cleaners cupboard at the end of the corridor. She looked at him quizzically but he just said, 
<br>"Don't let me interrupt." And wandered over to the opposite side of the room to the naked women. They all blushed even more as they felt his gaze upon them.
<br>"As I have said," Sheila went on, " Martin is fully aware of the situation and therefore I will come straight to the point and tell you what I intend for you to do instead of me calling the police.
<br>"Isn't this enough,"  the blond Julie asked in a small voice.
<br>"No it is not,"  Sheila snapped back, "Remember, you agreed to this or we could still call the police.
<br>Julie didn't reply.
<br>"Right then, this is what is going to happen,"  Sheila announced taking on a stern voice, " In a minute we are going to leave this office, you four without your clothes, and I'll take you down to the side exit. From there your going to leave and make your way across the business park to our rival over the other side and'"
<br>"Your joking" Amanda gasped the first of the four to realise what they were going to have to do. She like all the women knew the layout of the business park. Their store was at one end of the site and their rival was right at the other side. In between there were numerous other stores and of course being  an out of town site there were huge open car parks. Amanda reckoned  from one store to the other it must be nearly a mile and a half.
<br>"I'm not joking," Sheila continued, " and once there I want you each to bring   a trolley back here with you.
<br>"No!" Anne cried in horror.
<br>"Yes" Sheila replied sternly, " or I call the police"
<br>Anne said nothing.
<br>"What about my hands" Amanda complained, " I can't push a trolley like this" and pulled on her bound hands.
<br>"We'll find some rope" Sheila explained, " and you can pull one back and I should also point out that this is a team effort, so you all have to get back or none of you get your clothes back. In fact you won't even get into the store."
<br>"That's not fair." Julie said nervously
<br>"No it isn't," Sheila agreed, " But you don't have much choice."
<br>Silence greeted this last comment broken only when Martin said,
<br>" Can I say a few words?"
<br>"By all means" Sheila replied graciously.
<br>"Thanks," Martin said and then went on, " Firstly I have to say how disappointed I am in you all, both in you dishonesty and also in the way you have deceived  Sheila . Also I think you are very lucky that Sheila has given you this chance to avoid the police and almost certain prosecution so I suggest you take it however embarrassing it may be." 
<br>At this point he paused and looked at the four women, none of whom could look their manager in the face as he lectured them.
<br>"Actually, he continued, " I was considering sending you on one of those team building exercises that head office are so keen on but Sheila seems to have devised one for you. I'm sure our accounts department would be delighted at the cost saving if we could tell them." 
<br>Sheila smiled, the others didn't.
<br>"However," Martin continued, " As far as company policy is concerned, what Sheila has done here is well beyond the bounds of acceptability. Sheila suddenly looked startled and the four women looked up , "but you are all far too deep in this now so you four will still do what Sheila has proposed but in view of her overstepping her authority she will be joining you.
<br>"What!" Sheila nearly choked.
<br>"You heard," Martin addressed her, " whilst I agree with not involving the police this is going a bit far. I also don't have to remind you that this supermarket  believes in its management leading by example, so now is your chance.
<br>"I'll do no such thing." Sheila almost squeaked noticing that the four bakery staff were all grinning despite their own predicament. Their boss had got her comeuppance.
<br>Martin put his hands on the desk and looked directly at the still seated  Sheila.
<br>"You will or I'll call the police," he said smiling.
<br>"It will look bad on you," she tried to argue.
<br>"It will look worse on you and what about these four."
<br>"Come and join the party," Amanda called out none too pleasantly.
<br>Sheila stared at the desk in front of her.
<br>"Well," Martin asked  reaching for the phone.
<br>"Ok Ok," Sheila conceded and stood up.
<br>"Come round the front where we can see you " Martin told her with a smile and despondently Sheila did so.
<br>Martin took over her recently vacated chair and leaning back he said
<br>"Lose the clothes."
<br>Sheila didn't know where to look, five minutes ago she had been telling the four other women what humiliating things she had decided they were to do yet now she was going to have to take part herself. She began to wonder if calling the police might not have been such a bad idea.
<br>Sullenly Sheila kicked off her shoes well aware that the women she had made strip were enjoying every minute of her unexpected  embarrassment. Her black knee length skirt was next as she undid it and allowed it to slide to the floor to reveal a black lacy half slip. Without stepping out of her skirt she started to unbutton her light pink blouse although this proved a little difficult due to her trembling fingers. She finally succeeded and after undoing the cuffs took it off to reveal a well built bra that was doing a reasonable job of containing her 36DD breasts. She dropped the blouse next to her before reaching behind her to  unclip her bra. This again proved to be a struggle and in the end Anne stepped forward and deftly released it for her. This took Sheila by surprise and the bra whipped round causing her breasts to burst free of  their confinement. 
<br>"Oh," she cried as she made a brief attempt to cover her modesty and then realised it was a waste of time and instead slid her bra off. As she dropped it next to her she could see out of the corner of her eye the four bakery staff were enjoying her strip. A quick glance at Martin saw him looking at her breasts and she felt her face turn bright red with shame. Stood there stripped to the waist was not her idea of fun but things were going to get worse. Taking a deep breath she put her thumb in the elasticated waist of her slip and in a quick move thrust it down to her knees at which point she released it so it fell to the floor. There was a brief murmur of surprise before Amada asked in a smug voice,
<br>"What no knickers?"
<br>"er no," Sheila tried to explain
<br>"Forget to put them on," Anne asked joining in.
<br>"I don't often wear them," Sheila said in a quiet voice.
Martin stared at his deputy manager standing in front of him clad only in a pair of hold up stockings. There was more to her than met the eye. He realised he was staring and snapping out of it said,
<br>"Lose the stockings,"   Sheila peeled them down to leave her stark naked.
Not wishing to remain the centre of attention any longer than possible Sheila said,
<br>"Shall we get on with it then?" 
<br>"In a minute ," Martin answered rising to his feet, "Amanda has a handicap so its only fair that you do."
<br>Sheila groaned and asked, "Like what?" 
<br>He then, without answering, picked up the tape that Sheila had earlier used on Amanda and went over to where he had lent the broom handle against the wall.
<br>"What are you going to do?" Sheila asked nervously as he approached her.
<br>"Just do as you are told." Martin replied. He them put the broom handle horizontally across the back of Sheila's neck and told her to hold both ends of it with her hands. Then using copious amounts of the tape he firmly wrapped it around her hands until it was impossible for her to let go. Standing back he admired his handiwork, the large chested Sheila looked like she was wearing a sort of yoke.
<br>"Don't do this to me," Sheila begged desperately knowing what was coming next.
<br>"Too late, " Martin informed her, " besides I expect my Managers to be able to overcome any adversity, consider it a challenge.
<br>Martin looked at his watch,
<br>"Half past ten," he announced looking up at the women and then with a big grin said,
<br>"Time to go."
<br>Greeted with a chorus of groans and pleas to let them off he eventually had to resort to holding his had up to gain their attention.
<br>"There is no going back now, " he informed them and strode over to the door. Pulling it open he said,
<br>"Lets go" and watched as the naked women dejectedly filed out. Sheila was last and had to turn sideways to get through the opening, her hands taped to the broom. Michael followed her out and couldn't resist a slap across her naked buttocks which caused Sheila to squeal in protest.
<br>"Down to the side exit" he called after Amanda who was leading the strange procession. Amanda nodded in acknowledgement  and kept going not really accustomed to the feeling of her breasts swinging freely but unable to do anything about it due to her bound hands. Behind her followed a still mortified Angela, her secrets discovered she had one arm across her flat chest and the other hand covered her shaven crotch. Julie followed and walked with her arms by her side, despite her own nakedness she couldn't help but feel sorry for the 19 year old in front of her. Anne was behind her arms crossed tightly across her chest and looking at the ground. She wanted to get the ordeal over as soon as possible and feel clothes on her body once more. For Sheila bringing up the rear it was a nightmare. She had got them all into this situation and as she struggled along behind the other four, hands bound wide, she was horrified to find that her pendulous 36DD breasts had taken on a life of their own and were swaying around in all directions. Her face went bright red as she realised that Martin was watching her very closely.
<br>The procession continued on until they reached the exit  where they halted.. Martin produced a bunch of keys and selecting one unlocking  the door..
<br>"Everybody clear on what is required," he asked grinning. 
<br>There were a few murmurs before he added,
<br>"Just remember, you won't get back in unless there are five of you with five trolleys."
<br>Another round of groans enured as the women realised they were really going to have to do this. 
<br>"I also expect you two to remain bound as you are," he finished addressing Sheila and Amanda.
<br>He studied the women for a few second before saying,
<br>"Off you go then," and watched in delight as all five nervously exited the building directly into the car park.  Sheila brought up the rear once again and as soon as she was through the door Martin pulled it shut and promptly locked it. Fortunately for the naked women it was fairly dark and most of the lights of the store were not on but even so they all felt vulnerable. Amanda scurried over  and hid behind one of the few remaining parked cars. The other four following resulting in some bumping and jostling as they crashed into each other. 
<br>"Ow," cried Julie as someone stood on her foot.
<br>"Shut up", Amanda hissed not wanting to attract attention
<br>Julie discovering that Sheila was the one who had trod  on her slapped the hapless woman across her face.
<br>"Argh" Sheila cried her eyes watering.
<br>"Be quiet" Amanda whispered , "Do you want us to be caught."
<br>"Sorry," Julie apologised, " it was this stupid bitch's fault."
<br>"I'm sorry," Sheila  said in a small voice.
<br>"I see," Amanda replied, " Slap her for me will you."
<br>Julie promptly did so, this time on the other cheek.
<br>As her head cleared Sheila heard Amanda say,
<br>"That's for getting us into this mess"
<br>"I'm sorry," was all she could say.
<br>Amanda ignored her and looked out over the car bonnet.  
<br>"The coast is clear," she announced, "Lets go"
<br>Do we have to?" Angela wailed still trying to cover herself.
<br>"What do you think," Julie hissed from behind her.
<br>Amanda despite her bound hands took the lead and came out from their temporary hiding place and set off across the car park. Even in day light and full of cars the car parks were vast but in the gathering gloom to the naked women they seemed huge. One minor consolation was that occasionally the monotony of car parking spaces were broken up by small grassy islands complete with a few bushes. No doubt the planners had thought it would be a nice touch. Dotted about the car parks these provided the only cover  there was. so Amanda  naturally led the way to the  nearest island and its scant protection.. Rather alarmingly there were a few cars still dotted about and the women couldn't  help but wonder where the occupants were. Amanda arrived first at the island and crouched close to a small shrub.. Seconds later the rest of the bakery staff caught up and huddled around her as Sheila brought up the rear somewhat impeded by her yoke. As soon as she arrived Amanda and the other 3 set off again so she had no alternative but to keep going. This went on until they were about half way there by which  time   Sheila was lagging some way behind. Stopping for longer than usual to give them all chance to get their breath Amanda realised this when the gasping Sheila arrived some time after the rest of them. Amanda would have  quite happily left Sheila behind, blaming her for the situation they were in but Martin had made it clear that all five of them had to return or they wouldn't get back into the store. Amanda wasn't completely convinced Martin would actually leave them naked outside but she had no  intention of finding out the hard way. Cursing to herself that her hands were fastened behind her she told Angela to break a branch off of the small tree they were hiding behind.
<br>" Why?" Angela asked as she did so.
<br>"Because," Amanda explained, "I'm putting you in charge of that big titted cow," and nodded in Sheila's direction. "I want you to use that stick on her if she starts lagging behind.
<br>"O right," the normally shy Angela smiled, she was going to relish her new  assignment.
<br>Two minutes later Amanda led the way once more from their hiding place and naked feet slapping on the tarmac went in the direction of the next island.. Sheila who had sunk to her knees whilst regaining her breath was a little slow to return her feet and was assisted by Angela apply the stick across her naked backside.
<br>"Ow," she cried but ran after the others rather than complain too much. Angela followed behind, and being younger, fitter and not impeded easily kept up. At frequent intervals she applied her stick to various parts of her anatomy . Sheila managed to grit her teeth and  keep  going.
<br>"50 yards away from their next haven they were suddenly startled by the sound of a car engine and looked round to see a car speeding into the far end of the car park. Although it was some distance away they wasted no time in dashing the last few yards to their new hiding place. Sheila on this occasion had no need of  Amanda's encouragement  and was hard on the heels of the rest. Crouching down behind the shrubs , which fortunately were somewhat larger than those at some of their previous stopping off points, they watched in growing horror as the car headed in their direction at some considerable speed. As it approached a feeling of horror washed over the 5 women  as they all began to wonder if they had been discovered. At the last minute , however the car turned sharply and pulled up on the other side of the women's hiding place. They all tried to crouch down as low as possible and held their breaths as the car engine was turned off. This was immediately replaced by the sound of voices and then a car door opened and at least one of the occupants got out. 
<br>"Did you like that then?" a young male voice enquired jovially.
<br>"Your an idiot," a female voice replied angrily
<br>The conversation continued and it quickly became apparent that in front of the women there was as young boy racer type trying to impress his girlfriend. Unfortunately the girlfriend was unimpressed by his driving. It was then that Amanda who was still trying to make herself as small as possible  noticed that Julie was trying to look round the bush to see what was occurring on the other side. 
<br>"What are you doing," Amanda hissed fearful that Julie would get them discovered.
Julie did not reply but peeked from her hiding place and then suddenly made a small gasp  and slumped back onto her knees.
<br>"What?" Amanda whispered 
<br>"Its my daughter," Julie  hissed in despair.  She thought the female voice had seemed familiar and a careful look between two shrubs had confirmed her worst fears. She had seen her daughter , illuminated by the car headlights , in a heated discussion with some youth whom she didn't recognise.  Cowering naked the thought of being discovered by her 18 year old daughter was one too terrible to contemplate and she began to tremble. The argument came to an abrupt end when the youth stormed back to his car and wki6th a screech of tyres departed leaving Julie's daughter standing in the car park. She hurled a mouthful of abuse after the car, language which her mother had never heard her use before. Then she stood motionless for a minute, obviously thinking about what to do next before turning and walking in the direction of the women . Clearly she had decided to walk home and she skirted round the island and headed off across the car park. The woman crouched in near terror, particularly Julie as they heard her footsteps approach , then pass by them and start to recede. Sighs of relief were about to be let out when the footsteps abruptly stopped. Some of the cowering women looked up to see that she had stopped, still with her back to them and was rummaging in her pocket. By now their eyes had adjusted to the dark and they could see as she produced a packet of cigarettes from her pocket . Julie managed to pluck up the courage to look up at this point and got another shock in that she didn't realise her daughter smoked. The girl struck a match which promptly went out in the light breeze that was blowing. She tried twice more and failed again before she turned round to get her back to the direction of the wind. As she did this the women all ducked down again, in fact there were virtually lying down by now, pressing down onto either the small amount of grass by the bushes or the tarmac of the car part. Nipples already erect due to the effects of the cool breeze rubbed painfully on the tarmac. This was the least of their worries at that moment as the girl finally succeeded in lighting her cigarette. She took a long drag on it and looked up her eyes now also becoming accustomed to the gloom. Her eyes opened wide and the cigarette fell out of her mouth as she took in the sight in front of her. Not sure what to make of it she stood rooted to the spot for several moments before taking cautious steps towards what looked to her like naked people. 
<br>"Run" Amanda yelled, struggling to her feet realising they had been spotted. The others need no encouragement , especially Julie, who ran past her daughter with her hands over her face and was soon leading the women, desperate as she was to get away. Before Julie's daughter knew what was happening the woman had gone and were running across the car park. She looked after them and shrugged in disbelief, not quite sure if she was dreaming. Then, remembering her cigarette she searched around her feet until she located it , picking it up she took a long drag before slowly walking in the direction of her home. As she walked she couldn't help thinking one of the women seemed strangely familiar.
<br><br>
The five women ran on until they reached   their goal, the store on the other side of the estate. They threw caution to the wind and carried on, naked feet slapping on tarmac and breasts swinging around wildly. It was Angela who arrived first and crouched down by a line of shopping trolleys, having dropped her stick and abandoned the idea of making Sheila keep up.. Anne was not far behind her and seconds later Julie arrived. All were out breath after their high speed dash and it was sometime before Amanda, hands bound arrived and joined them. There was an even longer wait for Sheila complete with her broom to turn up but she finally made it panting heavily. All five then remained where they were while they fully regained their breath. A slight feeling of elation that they had made it was soon tempered by the realisation that they   still had to make their way back again, this time with a trolley each. 
<br>"Shit" Amanda suddenly said out loud, "How do I get a trolley back with my hands behind my back."
<br> She glared at Sheila, " You said you'd get me some rope," she said recalling an earlier conversation in Sheila's office.
<br>"Sorry, I forgot," Sheila replied, sarcastically, " I must have had other things on my mind."
<br>"Don't get clever with me," Amanda snapped angrily, "this is all your fault, don't forget."
<br>"You started it selling the bread," Sheila answered nastily.
<br>Amanda didn't say anything but instead stood up and kicked , the crouching Sheila between the breasts causing her to topple over. 
<br>Sheila  cried as she fell over but none of the others came to her aid as she struggled back up, they all blamed her for their predicament as well.
<br><br>Amanda started to calm down again as Anne said,
<br>"There is a builders rubbish skip over there, perhaps there is some rope in it ."
<br>"Good idea," Amanda agreed , "Go and look."
<br>The remaining four stayed where they were as Anne trotted over to the skip and peered over the edge. They watched as she reached in and poked about before retrieving something. A couple of minutes late she camera back with various bits of rope and string but to the puzzlement of the   waiting four she also looked like she was carrying a tin of paint. 
<br>"What's that?" Julie asked as Anne put the tin down and dropped the string and rope next to it. 
<br>"Its a tin of that thick black gooey stuff you use on roofs," Anne explained, "I can't remember what you call it.
<br>"What fucking use is that?" Sheila asked still disgruntled, "Just get the rope"
<br>The normally placid Anne like the others had become steadily more disgruntled with Sheila and when she had looked in the skip and seen the half used tin with a brush sticking in it an evil thought struck her.
<br>"I'll show you what use it is," she announced picking up the tin and marching over to the kneeling Sheila. She reached in and carefully extracted the brush as Sheila squealed,
<br>"What are you doing?:"
<br>"I'll show you," Anne replied and promptly slapped a brush load of the black goo on Sheila's ample chest.
<br>"Noooooo." Sheila cried as she felt the brush between her breasts. She tried to get up and move away but Anne was too quick for her. She put the tin down and grabbed Sheila by the hair making sure she couldn't get up. then, with a big grin on a face she proceeded to brush the thick black paint all over Sheila's breasts.
<br>The other three watched in amazement, more at the fact that it was the normally shy Anne who humiliating Sheila rather than what she was actually doing. 
<br>"Shut up and don't move" Anne snapped as Sheila continued to struggle, " or I'll tip it over your head."
<br>This caused Sheila to remain still , she hung her head and watched in despair as Anne applied the thick paint to her bosom.
<br>When she decided she had finished Anne dropped the paint brush back in the tin and said,
<br>"Thats for getting us into this mess,"
<br>Sheila just sniffed in reply
<br>Let me have a go," Julie said gleefully getting to her feet which caused Sheila to look up in horror and silently mouth, "No"
<br>In a flash Julie was by Sheila's side and reaching for the brush, 
<br>"Stand up" she ordered to which Sheila begged,
<br>"Please, no more" 
<br>Julie didn't bother to reply, instead she unceremoniously hauled the wretched Sheila to her feet by her hair.
<br>"Don't do this," Sheila continued to plead as Julie held the brush up in front of her,
<br>"I wouldn't miss this for the world, Honey" she grinned before wiping the laden brush between Sheila's legs. The deputy manager was humiliated beyond belief as she felt the brush applied to her most intimate parts . Julie made sure copious quantities were used and proceeded to work them in well  before   turning Sheila round and finishing off by painting her backside.
<br>"Very smart," she said as she finished and stood back to admire her handiwork. She was about to put the brush down when Angela bounded over announcing,
<br>"My turn, my turn,"
<br>So Julie carefully handed her the brush, avoiding getting any of the goo on their hands. Angela wasted no time and promptly started to apply the paint to Sheila's left hand and then work her way up her arm across her shoulders and down her right arm to her right hand. Still bound to the broom Sheila was helpless and stood in silence as Angela went about her work. She didn't even resist when Angela came round to face her and carefully applied a small amount of paint to each cheek. 
<br>Giggling Angela looked at Sheila and then dropped the paint brush back in the tin. Amanda once again wished her hands were not bound so she could have joined in.

<br><br>
"Lets get ready to go back," she called out, snapping them all back to the reality of their situation. They still had the 11/2 mile journey back to their own store to make, this time with a shopping trolley each. As quietly as they could Anne and Julie extracted 5 trolleys from where they were stored whilst Angela  tied the rope and string together to enable the bound women to pull their trolleys.
<br>"Don't do one for Amanda," Julie said when she saw what Angela was doing, I'll push Amanda's for her."
<br>Sheila looked up at this but her hopes were dashed when Julie went on to add, "But that cow can tow her own.". 
<br>A few minutes later they were ready to depart and out of pure devilment and despite Sheila' protests  Angela tied the rope to one of the trolleys  and  then fastened it around the deputy manager's left ankle.
<br>"This will make it very hard for me" Sheila tried to explain but all Angela said in reply as she stood up was, "I know"
<br>"Time to go," Amanda announced, "and was about to set off when Anne said,
<br>"Hang on a minute , I've just had another idea." And without waiting for a reply she ran over to the skip again and within a few seconds pulled out a half full black bin bag. She then went over to Sheila who was unable to react before the contents of the bag were emptied over her head. The bag contained sawdust and wood chipping which promptly stuck to all the areas of Sheila's body that had previously been painted including her cheeks. Just for good measure Anne then bent down and picked up some of the sawdust that had made it to the ground and threw it at the parts of Sheila that had got missed. Sheila had never felt so humiliated in her life. The other four laughed as Amanda began to lead them back to their own store. Sheila once again brought up the rear walking with a sort of limp, as the trolley careered along wildly behind her. Progress was slow but it was later and darker now so they weren't so bothered about been seen and as a result didn't bother about the islands. The return journey was uneventful, or at least as uneventful as it could be for five naked women pushing supermarket trolleys. Their hearts were in their mouths as the trolleys rattled along and they were sure that they had the noisiest trolleys in the world. If it was bad for the four bakery staff it was twice as bad for their deputy manager. She struggled along  with her trolley weaving madly behind her as she tried to keep up with the rest of them. but it was impossible and she gradually dropped behind. The others didn't notice this as they were more intent on getting their ordeal over and it was only when they arrived back at their own store, much to their relief , that they realised Sheila was no longer with them.   As they stood waiting for her to catch up Martin appeared and opened the door. They tried to enter but he reminded them that all five had to be present before they would be allowed back in. so they waited impatiently  for the somewhat handicapped Sheila to appear. Whilst they waited once again they became conscious of their nakedness and   started to hide themselves from Martin's gaze. Angela with her flat chest and shaven crotch was particularly aware of this and tried to hide herself behind the other three.   Julie  took the opportunity to untape  Amanda's hands and the bakery supervisor stood    there flexing her arms as they all began to wonder where Sheila had got to and after five minutes their concerns began to grow. 
<br>"Where the hell is she?" Julie asked growing impatient and after another two minutes Martin suggested they might like to go and look for her and to emphasise the point he returned inside the store and locked the doors again.
<br>Cursing the four   women  retraced their steps and it wasn't many minutes before they found the hapless Sheila on her knees desperately trying to right her upturned trolley which had capsized when it had got stuck in a drain cover.
<br>"Thank God your here," she said panting from her exertions as she saw the four approach her. Instead of helping the struggling woman Amanda walked over to her and slapped her across the face.
<br>"Ow" Sheila cried.
<br>"That's because I wasn't able to do it earlier," she explained .
<br>Julie was about to drag the deputy manager to her feet by her hair when a voice caused her heart to miss a beat,
<br>"Evening mother,"
<br>Julie whirled round to find that her daughter had appeared from behind one of the islands that had previously sheltered the naked women and was stood about 10 feet away from them with her hands on her hips. Following her previous encounter Julie's daughter, whose name was Belinda, had actually set off home but couldn't get the event she had witnessed out of her mind. She didn't get very far before she decided to wait and see if anything further happened. Twenty minutes later as she stood behind one of the shrubs she heard a rattling of trolleys and a cautious peek enabled her to see four naked women walking past. She was about to follow them when she heard another trolley and was amazed to see a fifth woman strangely bound dragging a trolley fastened to her ankle. As she watched the trolley got stuck in a drain cover and fell over. Lighting another cigarette she watched from her hiding place to see what would transpire. She had to wait some time and had long since finished her cigarette when the four women reappeared, still completely naked although she noted that none of them now had bound hands. But what she did notice with a start as they passed close by her hiding place was that the one who had seemed strangely familiar was in fact her own mother. The feeling of shock quickly passed as she thought how she could turn this unexpected situation to her advantage.   Belinda had clashed with her mother over virtually everything in the last few months which had resulted in her social life being severely restricted but now she saw the possibility of  being  able to gain the upper hand. Without further ado she came out from her hiding place and stood behind the women.
<br>"Sorry I didn't recognise you earlier, mother " she laughed sarcastically, "It might be something to do with your lack of clothes. 
<br>She watched in delight as her mother tried to cover herself absolutely mortified to be caught like this by her own daughter.
<br>"O my God," Julie moaned to herself as Belinda casually walked over to her and ignoring the other four said,
<br>"Perhaps you could tell me what you are actually doing." 
<br>"Its none of your business" Julie answered in a whisper unable to look her daughter in the eye.
<br>"Well it is now" Belinda replied nastily, " or I can make it Dad's business as well."
<br>"Nooo" Julie moaned  as the other four watched , feeling pity for Julie but unable to do anything to help her. 
<br>"Well tell me what going on then," Belinda insisted so Julie with no other choice told her what had been going on. Belinda laughed as Julie told her the story and upon its completion smiled and said,
<br>"Don't worry mum, do as I say for a while and it can be our secret." 
<br>Julie didn't like the sound of that, it sounded like blackmail but was unable to say anything before her daughter added,
<br>"Well don't let me keep you any longer ," and then added, "Its been nice to see you all  or should I say all of you"
<br>Belinda laughed, nobody else did as   Angela and Anne freed Sheila's trolley and they trudged past a triumphant teenager and made their way to the store.
<br>On arrival Martin was waiting and asked where they had been. Julie said nothing about her daughter and the others decided not to either. The four bakery staff entered the store as Martin told them their clothes were still in Sheila's office. They hurriedly made their  way there as Martin went to release Sheila from her bonds. When he saw the state she was in he laughed.
<br>"I take it you weren't too popular then ?" 
<br>"No" Sheila replied glumly.
<br>Martin untied her ankle from the trolley and then said,
<br>"You're not coming back into the store in that state, I'll go and fetch your clothes."
<br>Are you not going to untie me first?" Sheila wailed
<br>"When I get back," he replied as he closed the door behind him leaving Sheila waiting alone.
<br>By the time Martin got to the office the others were virtually dressed.
<br>"What did you do to her?" he asked
<br>"Just getting a little revenge," Amanda answered.
<br>"I see," Martin said as he gathered up Sheila's belonging and left again.
<br>When he got back he opened the door and went outside. He put her clothes on the ground and untied Sheila with some difficulty before saying
<br>"Goodnight," and going back into the store.
<br>The still naked Sheila flexed her arms and looked in despair at the black goo on her body, she hoped it would wash off. She realised there was nothing she could do about it there and then and was just contemplating which clothes to put on and almost certainly ruin when the four woman came around the corner of the building having left the store through a different door. On seeing Sheila Amanda and Anne marched up to her and before the deputy manager realised what was happening they had picked up her clothes. 
<br>"What are you doing," she asked nervously.
<br>"We'll keep these," Amanda announced and reaching into one of Sheila's jacket pockets she threw a bunch of keys which landed at the managers feet.
<br>"Please" Sheila begged but to no avail as the four walked off , all but Julie laughed, she had other things on her mind'..

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Sheila shivered as another gust of wind blew and scattered the leaves she had just swept off the path back from where they had come. She looked at the house and was startled to see there ewer now three people watching her out of the window. Shivering as another cold gust blew cross her naked body she started once again to brush up the leaves.
<br><br>
In the warmth of the lounge stood Martin and another man in his late fifties. They had just been joined by a tall and elegant woman of slightly younger age who was his wife.<br><br>
"Is this the one you were telling me about, dear" the woman enquired of her husband<br><br>
"Yes, that's her," the man replied.<br><br>
"Yes Martin added, " Unfortunately for her she didn't know that I was friends with your husband."<br><br>
The woman smiled, "Yes, being friends with the chief accountant can have its advantages,"<br><br>
"Indeed" Martin agreed turning his gaze back to the naked Sheila toiling in the garden.<br><br>
Being old friends of Henry Cain had proved useful in the past but none more so than now. The day after the event he had told Henry the whole story and asked him to lose the excess flour somewhere in the accounts. Henry had done so but they had hatched a little scheme to have some fun at Sheila's expense. In return for getting her off the hook Sheila now found herself sweeping the paths in Henry's somewhat enormous garden.<br><br>
"I'll go and make dinner," Mrs Cain announced and without waiting for an answer headed off to the kitchen. The two men remained watching Sheila's futile attempt to sweep up the leaves.<br><br>
"Do you think she knows you'd have adjusted the accounts without having to go out there" Martin asked<br><br>
"I shouldn't think so ," Henry replied, "Besides what's she like at her job?"<br><br>
"Very good, actually," Martin answered, "she should go far in this company."<br><br>
"Glad to here it as he turned his attention to Sheila again and in particular her large breast which were swinging around as she brushed.<br><br>
At this point Mrs Cain came back with a worried look on her face.<br><br>
"Darling," she said, wringing her hands, " I'm afraid I forgot to take the steak out of the freezer."<br><br>
"O dear," her husband answered , "Martin we'll have to eat out."<br><br>
"Fine by me," Martin answered, "What about Sheila."<br><br>
"I think you'd better keep her company," Henry said looking at his nervous wife.<br><br><br><br>
She mumbled a ,"Yes dear, I'm sorry." and with head bowed left the room.<br><br>
Martin said nothing and the general chit chat continued for about five minutes until Martin's jaw dropped in amazement. As he was watching Sheila he suddenly saw Mrs Cain walking across the lawn to her clutching a broom. She was totally naked as well and Martin had to concede that she was just as elegant without her clothes.!<br><br>
"She won't forget to take things out of the freezer again" Henry laughed reading Martin's thoughts. "Anyway I know a great little restaurant, so I'll just lock the back door and we'll be on our way.<br><br>
<br><br>
A few hours later in another part of town a woman walked back to her car from a corner shop.<br><br>
"Have you got my cigarettes" Belinda asked smiling evilly as Julie got back into the car.<br><br>
"Yes" Julie replied between clenched teeth and handed her the packet, "they are no good for you."<br><br>
"Don't lecture me."<br><br>
"Sorry"<br><br>
"Right then take me to the car park behind John Paul's night club."<br><br>
"Why?"<br><br>
"Because if you don't, I'll tell Dad what you've been up to last week.<br><br>
Julie said nothing and started the car engine.<br><br>
A few minutes later they arrived at the car park. Belinda immediately ordered her mother out of the car and went round and opened the boot.<br><br>
"Take off your clothes and put them in here" she snapped at Julie.<br><br>
"You've got to be joking," her mother gasped in astonishment<br><br>
"No I'm not," Julie replied, "get them off"<br><br>
"No way"<br><br>
"Well in that case I'll just have to tell Dad how I found you running round a car park stark naked so you could avoid getting into trouble with the police."<br><br>
Julie gulped and bent down to remove her shoes, things had got totally out of hand<br><br>
<br><br>
A short time later a gloating Belinda watched as Julie sullenly deposited her knickers, her last item of clothing in the boot. Belinda pushed her out of the way and slammed the boot shut before locking the rest of the car. She then turned to her mother who was desperately trying to cover herself and said,<br><br>
"I should be back in about three hours," and then added, "Unless I meet a nice bloke that is and then it will be tomorrow morning."<br><br>
Julie looked in despair at her errant daughter and was rewarded with having cigarette smoke blown in her face.<br><br>
"Please" she begged but in response Belinda turned on her heel and walked off towards the night-club leaving her mother crouching naked behind the car'<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">James Foster was sat on his sofa next to Barbara Richards, both had their arms around each other and were kissing passionately. Barbara had fancied James for some time but as he worked for her husband she had not really done anything about it. But she couldn't believe her luck when James started chatting her up one day when she dropped into the office to see her husband. One thing led to another and when her husband went away on business and James' wife went to see an old school friend for a couple of days they made arrangements and ended up at his house.
<br><br>
Barbara was dressed in a black thigh length dress along with black stockings and shoes. This was offset by her blonde hair which fell back to just below her neck. For a woman in her late thirties she was still very attractive and was quite proud that James who was only in his mid twenties had chatted her up. She began to rub his crotch through his trousers and could feel his erection growing, she was going to enjoy this evening '
<br><br>
Suddenly the lounge door burst open and a shapely brunette walked in.<br><br>
"What the hell is going on here" she cried angrily putting her hands on her hips .<br><br>
James and Barbara flew apart as if they had suddenly received an electric shock from each other.<br><br>
"D..darling" James stammered, "I wasn't expecting you back tonight"<br><br>
"I can see that!" his wife, Joanne, retorted,<br><br>
"Good evening Barbara." She added icily.<br><br>
"Err' hello" Barbara replied quietly<br><br>
"Keeping my husband entertained whilst I'm away, that's very thoughtful of you"<br><br>
"Its not what it seems" James mumbled, " I'.er 'we were"<br><br>
"SHUT UP" Joanne interrupted , " James get your sorry arse upstairs, I'll deal with you in due course, right now I want to have a little talk with Barbara ."<br><br>
"But" James started<br><br>
"GET OUT OF MY SIGHT THIS INSTANT" his wife shouted. James knew there was no point in arguing and without looking at Barbara left the room. Joanne watched him go , slamming the door shut behind him ,and then whirled round to confront Barbara who standing up nervously said,<br><br>
" I think I'd better go"<br><br>
"Not yet you don't," Joanne began, " I want to find out exactly what my husband sees in a tart like you"<br><br>
At this she marched over and stopped abruptly in front of Barbara causing the pony tail her hair was in to flick round over her shoulder. Brushing it back she stared at the other woman.<br><br>
"I really do think I should leave" Barbara said , this time in a louder voice<br><br>
"You can leave now but if you do I'll tell your husband what's being going on," Joanne informed her in a menacing voice and folded her arms in front of her.<br><br>
Barbara paled, she knew her husband would almost certainly divorce her. Being a very religious man he wouldn't ever forgive his wife if he found out what she got up to behind his back.<br><br>
"If you let me leave now I'll promise that I will never go near your husband again" Barbara said with the desperation evident in her voice.<br><br>
" Too bloody right you won't," Joanne snarled , " and like I said a moment ago I want to know what it is that my husband sees in you, you must be at least forty."<br><br>
"I'm only 37" Barbara snapped back indignantly.<br><br>
"Well you look at least 40" Joanne replied nastily.<br><br>
Barbara just fumed, she knew she dare not push things too far and didn't continue the argument. She just tried to think of a way out of this mess she had got herself into . But her thoughts were rudely interrupted,<br><br>
"Take the dress off," Joanne suddenly ordered in a matter of fact tone.<br><br>
Barbara stared at her with eyes as wide as saucers,<br><br>
"W..W..What did you say," she asked not believing her ears.<br><br>
"You heard me," Joanne replied, "Get that dress off, I want to see exactly what a slut like you has to seduce my husband with."<br><br>
"NO" Barbara responded defiantly despite the feeling of extreme nervousness growing within her.<br><br>
"Right then ," Joanne announced, "I'm going to ring your husband and tell him what you've been up to."<br><br>
Silence greeted this comment as Barbara just stared at her feet. 30 seconds had passed before Joanne broke the silence,<br><br>
"Well what's it to be , the dress or a phone call?"<br><br>
"Please" Barbara begged, "I w'.."<br><br>
"DECIDE NOW" Joanne suddenly shouted, putting her hands on her hips and abruptly cutting off Barbara's pleadings , " YOUR DRESS OR I PHONE YOUR HUSBAND ."<br><br>
<br><br>
Barbara was shocked by this outburst but knew she was beaten so with trembling hands she reached behind her neck and fumbled for the zipper of her dress. It took her several seconds to locate and when she finally succeeded she slowly pulled it down until it stopped at about the same level as the top of her panties. Joanne folded her arms again and watched with a triumphant smirk on her face as Barbara started to undress herself. Her hands dropped to her sides as the zip reached the full length of its travel and she forced herself to look at Joanne at this point. The sneering look she got back in return made her realise that there was no way she could get out of this and she began to turn red with embarrassment. at the thought of having to disrobe in front of Joanne who was some 15 years her junior .<br><br>
<br><br>
"Well, I'm waiting" Joanne said impatiently .<br><br>
"Sorry," Barbara found herself mumbling as she wriggled her arms out of the dress and then pushed it down over her hips to allow it to drop to the floor. She stepped out of it and was bending down to pick it up when Joanne said,<br><br>
"Leave it there!"<br><br>

So she stood up again, blushing even more as she revealed the sexy underwear she had bought especially to impress James. Joanne looked her up and down as she stood there in black bra and panties along with matching suspender belt and stockings. The whole ensemble was designed more for glamour than practicality and there wasn't much material in any part of it but plenty of lace trim. As a result her 34C breasts were trying force their way out of the bra and her nipples were barely concealed. A few wisps of blonde pubic hair escaped from behind the extremely skimpy panties just to prove that she really was a blonde.
<br><br>
"Put your hands on your head and don't move " Joanne ordered and Barbara slowly did so. Joanne then walked slowly around the scantily clad woman looking her up and down as though she was a piece of meat . It was clear to Joanne that Barbara actually had a very good body for a 37 year old but she was dammed if she was going to tell her that . So it was several minutes later when she stopped in front of Barbara and bluntly asked, "Are your tits real or have you had surgery?"<br><br>
"They are real!" came an immediate reply from a suddenly annoyed Barbara, her current predicament temporarily forgotten .<br><br>
"So they sag a bit then?" Joanne immediately retorted<br><br>
"NO" Barbara cried.<br><br>
"Well if they don't sag than you've had a boob job by my way of thinking"<br><br>
"I told you I haven't" a now very irate Barbara answered<br><br>
"Show them to me then" Joanne ordered smiling wickedly.<br><br>
This knocked the wind out of Barbara's sails and she froze in horror.<br><br>
"You're not serious?" she gasped<br><br>
"O yes I am" Joanne told her still smiling. " Come on ,off with your bra"<br><br>
Barbara sighed, blushed even redder and taking her hands from her head reached up her back Her trembling fingers located the catch and she slowly undid her bra before just as slowly sliding the straps off her shoulders. Dejectedly she let it slip down her arms and drop to the floor next to her dress. Instinctively her arms crossed over her recently freed breasts but was swiftly rebuked by Joanne,<br><br>
"Get your hands back on your head."<br><br>
Barbara did so acutely aware of the other woman's gaze<br><br>
Joanne gazed at her breasts which sagged ever so slightly, clearly they were natural but she still humiliated the half naked woman by saying,<br><br>
"They are a bit saggy aren't they, perhaps you should get something done about them."<br><br>
Tears welled up in Barbara's eyes as the younger woman taunted her, but before she could say anything Joanne continued,<br><br>
" You have thirty seconds to get the rest of your clothes off starting NOW"<br><br>
Barbara didn't move so Joanne encouraged her by saying<br><br>
"If you are not completely naked in 25 seconds I shall make that phone call." This did the trick and the shoes, stockings, suspenders and panties were lying on the ground within 15 seconds. A deeply embarrassed Barbara then stood there nude trying to cover her nakedness with her hands and arms.<br><br>
"Hands back on head" Joanne commanded and when the naked blonde didn't do anything she added<br><br>
"NOW you cow," in a louder voice. Barbara then did as she was told and stood in front of Joanne completely naked, the shame of which was almost more than she could bear and she closed her eyes, as the tears welled up, in a vain attempt to shut out some of the nightmare she was going through. James' wife laughed and then spoke,<br><br>
"I think its time I found out what my husband has to say, I wonder how he is going to explain what he was doing with an old slag like you".<br><br>
Barbara sobbed at the reference to "old slag" but Joanne continued,<br><br>
"And to be honest I don't want you in my house so until I've dealt with him you can wait outside."<br><br>
Barbara breathed a sigh of relief , opened her eyes and reached for her clothes, "At least this part of the ordeal is over ," she thought to herself but Joanne snapped,<br><br>
"What do you think you are doing,"<br><br>
"Putting my clothes on so I can wait outside," Barbara mumbled nervously,<br><br>
"I never said get dressed! I just said wait outside," Joanne added icily and was delighted by the look of horror that crossed Barbara's face.<br><br>
"But'. Y..you , I mean" Barbara stammered in confusion.<br><br>
"Yes I do mean it, you will wait in the back garden as you are now and I hope you find it very humiliating. Although I doubt its half as bad as coming home and finding your husband in the arms of an old tart." Joanne then went over to the patio door unlocked it and slid it back, she felt the chill of the night on her face as she briefly looked out into the darkness. "Out you go then, and don't run away"<br><br>
Visibly shaking with fear Barbara began to plead and back away from the open patio door, but Joanne was in no mood for messing and she strode over to the phone. She had to do no more, the naked Barbara, arms across her chest made slow steps towards the open door. Goose pimples rapidly rose on her body as the cold night air touched her skin. The air also had the usual effect on her nipples .<br><br>
As she approached the door Joanne suddenly had an evil thought enter her head.<br><br>
"Stop," she called out after the naked woman,<br><br>
Barbara's hopes soared and she turned to come back into the room.<br><br>
"Don't turn round," Joanne continued, "Stay where you are and touch your toes."<br><br>
Barbara bent over, her hopes dashed once more, facing out of the open door. with no comprehension of what was happening. As she did so Joanne crossed the room and stood behind her before announcing, "I'm going to kick you out of my house'literally." And with that she quickly raised her left foot and placed her low heeled shoe on the naked backside in front of her. Hardly before Barbara could have felt the shoe touch her she was propelled by a sharp kick out into the night and sent sprawling across the patio Joanne slammed the door and locked it before Barbara could even get up. What had just happened then hit the naked woman and seconds later a near hysterical Barbara was pounding on the other side of the glass begging to be let in.<br><br>
"Don't make too much noise" Joanne warned her through the glass, "You don't want to wake the neighbours."<br><br>
This brought Barbara to her senses and she quietened down but the look of terror reappeared on her face as Joanne grinned and blew her a kiss before drawing the curtains. She then turned and headed out of the room switching the lights off as she left.<br><br>
<br><br>
Joanne walked into the bedroom which was lit only by the light coming from the TV and as her eyes adjusted to the gloom she saw her husband lying on the bed .<br><br>
"Fancy older women now do you?" Barbara asked him,<br><br>
"Not really , I'd sooner have you any day of the week" he replied,<br><br>
" Flattery will get you nowhere" Barbara chided him and then they both burst out laughing. When they eventually stopped James asked,<br><br>
"I take it she is now waiting naked in the garden for you to deal with me."<br><br>
"Correct" a smiling Joanne confirmed, "she should be shivering out there by now , I wonder if I can see her" and headed to the window.<br><br>
"Hang on a minute, James called after her .<br><br>
"What?" Joanne enquired stopping.<br><br>
"I've got a birthday present for you."<br><br>
"But my birthday isn't for another three weeks yet"<br><br>
"I know," James explained , "but this seems like the right time to give it to you."<br><br>
"What have you got me" Joanne asked curiously as she headed back from the window. "What is it" she asked excitedly.<br><br>
" Here," James explained, "Let me demonstrate." And he then proceeded to fiddle with the buttons on the remote for several seconds until the TV channel changed to a completely black screen.<br><br>
"Wow that's good" Joanne gently mocked him , " what's that a view of the back garden in the dark"<br><br>
James stopped and looked at her.<br><br>
"How did you guess"<br><br>
"Don't mess me about , what's this box of tricks suppose to do." Joanne asked now slightly irritated.<br><br>
"You got it in one" James answered, "I've set up a camera that's linked into the T.V. so that you can view your "catches" from the comfort of your own bedroom."<br><br>
"But its pitch dark" a now perplexed Joanne told him, "I can't see a damm thing."<br><br>
"If you give me a minute" James patiently replied, "I'll adjust the infra red so it can see in the dark!"<br><br>
"OH, sorry" was all Joanne could muster in reply.<br><br>

True to his word, after a few seconds of knob twiddling , a view of their garden appeared , albeit with a reddish tint. More adjustments by James over the next minute or two meant that when he handed the control to Joanne they were looking at a view of their garden that was as clear as if it were broad daylight. James explained how to pan and zoom the camera and then sat back to watch.<br><br>
Joanne immediately began to pan the camera across the garden.<br><br>
"Where is the bitch" she muttered under her breath, as she scanned the screen looking for a trace of the naked Barbara.<br><br>
"Maybe she's gone home" James taunted his wife.<br><br>
"Rubbish "came the reply, "she's somewhere out there."<br><br>
"Drop the angle of the camera and look on the patio" her husband suggested and Joanne did so.<br><br>
"YES." She cried in triumph as the nude form of Barbara appeared in one corner of the screen, Joanne quickly centered and zoomed in so the forlorn Barbara filled the whole of the television screen. It was immediately obvious to the pair in the bedroom that Barbara was cold, she was stood on the edge of the lawn looking hopefully in the direction of the patio door from which she had been ejected. She was hopping from one foot to the other and rubbing her hands up and down her arms in a futile attempt to keep warm.<br><br>
"Fancy a glass of wine" James asked his wife, producing a bottle and a couple of glasses from his bedside table.<br><br>
"What an excellent idea" Joanne responded gleefully, as she watched Barbara on the screen. James poured the wine as his <br><br>wife played with the controls and then handed one of the glasses to him.
"Cheers<br><br>"
"Cheers" Joanne<br><br> responded and they clinked the glasses together then settled down to watch Barbara. Several minutes passed in total silence before Joanne lent forward and stared intently at the screen.
"Brilliant," she cried <br><br>, "its starting to rain, I wonder how the old cow is feeling now."
"Can't help you on that one" <br><br>James replied sarcastically, " you'll just have to make do with the pictures for now."<br><br>
<br><br>
Cold, was the major thing on Barbara's mind at that moment in time. There were other thoughts, most notably , a feeling of total and utter dejection. Here she was , the sophisticated wife of a company director, a well respected member of the community , standing naked and shivering in a garden. To make matters worse she had been caught with a man by his wife and had been forced to strip naked by her and then thrown out of her house. She had never been so humiliated in her life but the cold was rapidly banishing all other thoughts from her mind, her teeth were already chattering so much she couldn't keep them still and her hands and feet were starting to go numb . She kept hoping the patio door would open despite the dread within her at the thought of what Joanne would do to her. "How could I get myself into such a mess," she wailed out loud to herself. Then she felt raindrops on her naked body and began to cry.<br><br>
<br><br>
Back in the bedroom the sight of Barbara crying was too much for Joanne. She finished her wine and hastily put her glass down. Then Joanne suddenly stopped and stared at the TV before ecstatically crying out<br><br>
"Hailstones, this is getting even better" . On the TV the view of Barbara became partially obscured as the hail stones got heavier. It was clear that they were agony on her cold wet body and with no protection whatsoever Barbara collapsed to her knees and tried to curl up as small as possible on the wet grass. She had to endure the pelting of them on her body for several minutes before they began to ease."<br><br>

Joanne was totally engrossed in watching Barbara suffer. She had laughed when the naked woman had suddenly got to her feet as the hail subsided and the rain came on heavier and ran round the garden trying to find somewhere to hide. Of course there was nowhere and she soon ended up curled up on the lawn again trying to make herself as small as possible. "Darling your not watching" Barbara suddenly noticed, her husband was reading a magazine.<br><br>
"Don't worry" he replied with a grin, " I'll watch the tape later"<br><br>
"You taped it?" Joanne cried " you're wonderful" and began to smother him with kisses. James pushed her away and in a serious voice said,<br><br>
"I really thing you'd better do something about Barbara"<br><br>
"Why" Joanne asked haughtily , not wanting to end her fun.<br><br>
"Because if you don't she end up with hypothermia , that's why" James informed her, "And that could take a bit of explaining."<br><br>
"What do you want me to do with her then." Joanne mischievously asked her husband<br><br>
"I don't care," he replied, " Send her home naked if you want, just get rid of her and come to bed.<br><br>
" Send her home naked'." Joanne giggled, "I like that" she headed downstairs leaving James lying on the bed.<br><br>
Once in the lounge, Joanne picked up Barbara's discarded handbag and went over to the patio door, she pulled back the curtain before unlocking it and sliding it open. The light from the lounge illuminated the figure of Barbara lying on the grass.<br><br>
"Oi bitch" Joanne called and Barbara raised her head. When she saw the open patio door she stiffly got up and headed towards it but to her dismay Joanne stopped her from entering the house. Joanne looked at the naked woman and had to try very hard not to break into a smile. By the light from the room behind her she could see that Barbara now looked a right mess. Apart from her constantly chattering teeth virtually every part of her body stung from the hailstones. In addition was completely wet from head to toe, the expensive hair style she had only had done the day before was totally ruined, her blonde hair now all straggly was plastered to her head and neck. All her make up had run, in particular her mascara had run down her face, Joanne had never seen anyone look so bedraggled and loved it. "I have spoken at length to my husband" she began " and have decided that this will be an end to the matter, if you agree?"<br><br>
"Yes" Barbara replied through chattering teeth as she rubbed her arms once more, "I really am very sorry"<br><br>
"Well here is your handbag, I presume your car keys are in it, so I suggest you get out of my sight and don't ever go near my husband again."<br><br>
"What about my clothes" asked the shivering woman.<br><br>
"You can do without them I think" Joanne smirked "It'll be a lesson to you, not to mess with other peoples husbands."<br><br>
Barbara was crestfallen,<br><br>
"But my car is three streets away, and what if I get caught" she pleaded.<br><br>
"That's your problem" Joanne retorted and without waiting for a reply slammed the door shut. This left the naked 37 year old blonde stood in the pouring rain wondering how to get home minus her clothes and when she did how she could get into her house without her husband catching her. Clutching her handbag to her chest she slipped out of the garden and headed up the drive.<br><br>
<br><br>
Joanne turned out the lights out the lights and shot back up to the bedroom. As she pulled off her dress she spoke to James saying,<br><br>
" She was number four, have you got any more lined up for me darling."<br><br>
"I might have," he grinned, " and as a matter of interest how are you going to return Barbara's clothes."<br><br>
"Well I thought I'd post her underwear back to her." she replied<br><br>
"And the dress?" James laughed<br><br>
"Its almost my size so, with a little alteration, I thought I'd wear it to the annual company dinner that is coming up in a few weeks"<br><br>
"Talk about rubbing salt into the wounds" James murmured to himself as they got into bed.<br><br>

<br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">For Anne Dawson and Kathy Scott three weeks in Poland, all expenses paid, seemed an opportunity too good to miss when the company that employed them had announced that was where it was sending them. A week into the business trip, however, they weren't so sure, having been chaperoned everywhere with not a moment to themselves; they were told it was for their own protection and under no circumstances were they weren't to leave their hotel without an escort. The two women were soon very sceptical of this, having seen no evidence of the supposed dangers that were allegedly hiding around every corner. So one evening, when they found out that the following day was effectively a day off they got their heads together and formulated a plan.
<br><br>
Early the next morning they slipped out of the hotel intent on exploring the countryside outside of the city they had been restricted to since their arrival. Dressed in their business suits and carrying briefcases they looked like they were going to yet another meeting within the hotel but instead they headed for the car park and were soon driving through the city streets in their Mercedes hire car.
<br><br>
It was a nice warm sunny day as they drove out of the city and found themselves travelling along a road not really knowing where they were headed. The city was soon left far behind as they drove into ever more rural areas of Poland. The further they went the poorer the road surface became and the less and less traffic they saw but neither woman really noticed this as they chatted and looked at the countryside. When they began to feel hungry they pulled into a small rundown filling station and bought something to eat. They paid for it in American dollars much to the surprise and delight of the elderly looking proprietor. Having no idea of the worthlessness of the Polish currency, the Zloty, they didn't know they had paid many times more than they should have. They ate their purchases quite quickly and set off once more although neither of them noticed the beat up white car that pulled out behind them and began to follow.
<br><br>
On a spur of the moment decision Anne turned the wheel of the blue Mercedes and left what purported to be the main road to head down a side road purely on the grounds that it looked interesting. Kathy and her were both deep in conversation, so deep, that neither of them noticed the car behind them turn off as well. It wasn't until a few miles further down the lane that the two occupants of the Mercedes suddenly became aware of its presence. It was at a point where the road widened slightly and there was the roar of an engine behind them as the rather tatty white car suddenly loomed in the Mercedes mirrors and started to overtake. There was barely room to get past, in fact it more or less barged its way by and whilst the cars didn't actually make contact they were close enough to cause Anne to instinctively brake. As she did the white car shot by and then skidded to a halt blocking the road. Anne turned the steering wheel and stamped hard on the brake pedal and as she heard Kathy scream she closed her eyes. A split second later she felt a gentle bump and then there was silence as the car engine stalled. When she plucked up the courage to open her eyes again she saw that the car, which had not been travelling fast at all, was on the grass verge with the drivers side up against a grass bank. Kathy screamed again and when a startled Anne looked towards her the two occupants of the other car were getting out and coming towards them.
<br><br>
"Get us out of here," Kathy said frantically as Anne tried to find reverse. This took longer that usually and she ended up looking down at the gear change due to the fact that she being British was used to a right hand drive car and this one was left hand drive. Finally she found it and gunned the engine but the car went nowhere as one of the wheels spun uselessly on the damp verge and dug itself in.<br><br>
"Come on," Kathy pleaded,<br><br>
"I'm trying" Anne snapped back and revved the engine again. But it was no use, the Mercedes was well and truly stuck.. As the two men approached Kathy in a panic hastily locked her door but too late she realised the window was still down.. She fumbled for the button to close it but was too late as one of the men reached in unlocked the door and opened it.<br><br>

He said something in Polish, which neither of the frightened women understood<br><br>
"Leave us alone," Anne said trying to remain calm.<br><br>
The man then said, in a heavily accented voice, "You are American?"<br><br>
"No, English" Anne replied cautiously and the man shrugged in acknowledgement.<br><br>
"I think your car is stuck," he said matter of factly.<br><br>
"I know" Anne agreed as Kathy shrank back from the open door on her side of the car.<br><br>
"Well, I suggest you turn off the engine and get out," he suggested with a sickly smile.<br><br>
"W..w..w.e'd rather not," Kathy stammered<br><br>
"Don't worry, we will not hurt you," the man reassured them in a rather unreassuringly way!<br><br>
Both women looked at each other and then, against their better judgement, but not having any other real options, Kathy turned off the engine and they exited the car via the passenger door. Anne's side of the car was too close to the grass bank for her to open her door as she found out when she tried.<br><br>
The women stood next to each other by the Mercedes dressed in their identical coloured light grey business suits, identical coloured because they were standard company issue. In many ways that was where the similarities ended. Kathy Scott was 31 year old 5ft 2" but it was her 38dd chest that never failed to draw the attention of male eyes and people rarely noticed her chestnut brown hair which came down to the middle of her back. 36-year-old Anne Dawson stood silently by her occasionally flicking her shoulder length jet-black hair from her eyes in what amounted to a nervous gesture. At 5ft 8" tall she was somewhat slimmer than Kathy and measured only 32dd in the chest department.<br><br>
<br><br>
Both women soon became aware of the two men's eyes being drawn to Kathy's chest so Anne coughed and tried to gain control of the situation.<br><br>
"What are you going to do," she asked trying to sound in authorative despite the pounding of her heart.<br><br>
"Its simple," the man explained as his accomplice reached into the Mercedes and extracted the ignition key,<br><br>
"We are going to rob you."<br><br>
You can't do that," Anne snapped back in an indignant voice as Kathy just whimpered in fright.<br><br>
"And why not?" the man asked.<br><br>
"Because you said you wouldn't harm us, "Anne replied desperately trying to keep calm<br><br>
"Indeed we won't," the man replied, "but it doesn't stop us robbing you."<br><br>
Anne could thing of nothing to say in reply as the man continued,<br><br>
" Its your own fault in some ways, you have no doubt been warned about travelling unescorted."<br><br>
Both women nodded and Anne mumbled a small, "Yes."<br><br>
"Then you only have yourselves to blame," he added before lapsing into silence. Anne and Kathy nervously looked around wondering what would happen next but their wait was a short one when the man suddenly said,<br><br>
"Get your bags from the car"<br><br>

Neither woman moved so he pointed at their handbags and briefcases, which were sat on the back seat. This time the women complied realising they had little choice. Kathy reached into the back of the car and got Anne's handbag and briefcase, which she passed out to her. She then reached back in and got her own before exiting. The non English-speaking accomplice, who sported a moustache and was somewhat shorter in statue than his compatriot, pointed at the bonnet of the Mercedes and made it clear that he wanted them to put the bags and cases on it. The women did so, now not doubting that they were going to be robbed.
<br><br>
"Stand back," the man said and as they did so his partner stepped forward and picked up Anne's bag and upended the contents onto the bonnet. Anne was about to protest but thought better of it. He then emptied Kath's bag as well before repeating the exercise with the briefcases. He then began to sort through the contents putting what he wanted into Anne's brief case and what he didn't into Kathy's. The women watched dejectedly as their personal effects were rifled through. Both their expensive cameras went into the case to be kept, as did all the cash, which was in US dollars, from their wallets. Kathy thought it was odd they discarded the credit cards but then it occurred to her that there would be little use for them in rural Poland. Pens, the wallets themselves, make up and other trinkets were kept but all the papers and suchlike were discarded. It was obvious to both women that the men had done this before. Once completed the man shut the two cases and then threw the one with the discarded items over the nearby hedge and into a field. Once again the women remained silent. Kathy's empty handbag followed it as the man shut the other brief case before picking up the remaining handbag and heading to the watching women.
<br><br>
Anne and Kathy shrank back as he approached them, held out the handbag and said something in Polish to them. Not comprehending Anne looked questioningly at the taller man.<br><br>
"Put your jewellery in the bag," he translated<br><br>
"Do we really have to," Kathy pleaded<br><br>
"Yes," was all the reply she got so with shaking hands she reached up and began to remove her gold necklace. Anne slowly and with some difficulty pulled off her solitary ring before dropping it into the bag. Kathy's necklace followed and both women then removed their watches. At this point Anne stood there while Kathy fumbled to get her two rings off followed by her silver bracelet.<br><br>
"Your earrings too," she was reminded and so she removed the last of her valuables and dropped them in the bag just as Kathy finished removing hers. The man with the bag, as soon as they had finished, strode back to the Mercedes and picked up the briefcase from the bonnets and took it to their own car. Opening the boot he placed it and the handbag containing the jewellery in before beckoning the two women to come over.<br><br>
Kathy and Anne exchanged nervous glances, they both now realised that they should have taken the warnings more seriously as they had just been robbed. Anne clenched her hand by her side but out of the corner of here eye she saw that Kathy was wringing hers together. Both were extremely worried as to what would happen now but again they had little time to ponder over their fate<br><br>
"Go over to our car, please," the English speaking man, said when neither woman responded to the beckoning man and they dutifully shuffled over to it.<br><br>
"Now would you take off your nice expensive shoes," he told them in a faintly mocking voice.<br><br>
"But.. Why?" Kathy managed to stammer<br><br>
"Because we are robbing you and they are worth something," he answered having noted earlier that both pair of black low-heeled slip on shoes was of good quality.<br><br>
"Oh," was all that Kathy could think of to say in reply, there being certain logic to what he said.<br><br>
Putting her hand on the car to steady herself, Kathy lifted her right foot and removed the shoe. She dropped it in the car boot and then repeated the exercise with the other foot. That shoe then joined the other in the car boot. Anne by contrast just kicked off her shoes and crouched down to pick them both up at the same time. Hers were then unceremoniously dumped in the car boot. Standing in their stocking feet the women looked at the man giving the orders not knowing what would happen next but beginning to get a nasty feeling about the whole thing. "Now could you take off your jackets," he said in a condescendingly nice way. Kathy looked away whilst Anne gave him a startled look and opened her mouth to protest. But before she could utter a word the man held up his hand and said,<br><br>
<br><br>
"Please, no arguments, we want the jackets." In almost a state of shock, Kathy started to remove hers. When Anne saw this her resolve crumbled and she did likewise. Both jackets then went into the car boot. Anne, now without the protection of her jacket was acutely aware of the male eyes once again being drawn to her ample chest. This time, however, they had a much better view with her reinforced bra clearly visible through the thin cotton fabric of her white blouse. In fact it was almost as if the two men's concentration wandered for a moment before the one giving the orders snapped himself out of it.<br><br>
"Can we have the skirts now?" he asked although it was not really a question.<br><br>
" Noooo," both women cried in unison as he finished<br><br>
They aren't worth much you know," Anne blurted out when what he had said sunk in.<br><br>
"They will be worth more as a set with the jackets," he told them and once again what he said was perfectly true.<br><br>
"You can't make us take them off," Kathy said in a small voice in a hopeless attempt at defiance.<br><br>
"Would you rather my friend here removed them?" the man replied and gestured to his leering colleague,<br><br>
"Please," Anne said resorting to pleading in an attempt to keep their skirts.<br><br>
"Take them off or have them removed for you," the man said in answer, "Your choice,"<br><br>
"This can't be happening," Anne thought to her self hoping that it was a nightmare and she would wake up in a minute. But she knew it wasn't and as there was no alternative she started to undo the button on the side of her skirt and then slowly unzipped it. Kathy sniffled and likewise started undoing her skirt, her face burning with the humiliation as she wondered how far things were going to go. Anne pushed her skirt down to her hips but was unable to make herself let it go to drop to the floor. It wasn't until she saw Kathy stepping out of hers, now crumpled around her ankles, that she managed to force herself to let it drop. She slowly stepped out of it and placed it in the car boot next to the rest of her clothes. Both she and Kathy were glad that the company issue blouses were cut on the generous side and as a result they virtually covered all of their knickers, however she still found herself tugged the hem down in a futile attempt to cover the bare flesh between where her hold up stocking ended and the blouse hem began. Kathy fared slightly better in that being shorter her hem came lower plus the fact that she was wearing tights which meant there was no bare flesh. Notwithstanding this she was still trying to pull her hem down as the two men looked at them both.<br><br>
<br><br>
"I can't believe this is happening," Anne muttered under her breath, "I should never have let you talk me into this."<br><br>
"It wasn't my idea," Kathy retorted, their dire predicament temporarily forgotten," it was your idea."<br><br>
"Bloody wasn't", Anne snapped back, a little louder this time, and glared at Kathy.<br><br>
The shorter woman opened her mouth to continue the argument but was cut off by the voice of the man.<br><br>
"Sorry to interrupt, ladies," he said with a grin on his face," but its time for your stockings."<br><br>
"No way," Anne retorted.<br><br>
"Get lost," Kathy started, both women fired up by the accusation they had just made to each other.<br><br>
"We can help you if you like?" the man told them and then watched as the fight rapidly left them.<br><br>
"You can't tell me these are worth anything," Anne questioned.<br><br>
"Maybe not where you come from but in this country they are.."<br><br>
Anne got the point and peeled her left stocking down her leg. Kathy reached under her blouse and wriggled her tights down her leg once again using the car to steady herself as she pulled them off her feet. It was not long before their hosiery was in the car boot.<br><br>
After a moments silence, Anne quietly asked,<br><br>
"Please can we go now?"<br><br>
"No," the man replied, " we haven't finished robbing you yet.<br><br>
"But we have nothing left," Anne wailed.<br><br>
The man translated into Polish for his associate and they both laughed out loud which sent a chill down both the partially clad women's spines.<br><br>
"There are one or two things in your possession we may be interested in," the man informed them when he stopped laughing<br><br>
"You can't," Kathy said almost choking,<br><br>
No answer was forthcoming instead the men watched the two women squirm as a gentle breeze blew on their recently uncovered legs and their bare feet made contact with the tarmac. Both women's faces were now red with embarrassment as they realised the hopeless position they were in.<br><br>
Finally the man put them out of their misery or to be more precise, added to it.<br><br>
"Take the blouses off," he said with a trace of amusement in his tone.<br><br>
Kathy and Anne begged and pleaded but it was to no avail and it was only when the two men approached them and threatened to remove their blouses for them that they capitulated. . Anne felt like crying and wished the ground would open up and swallow her up as she undid the buttons on the cuffs of her blouse. Slowly she then began to undo the ones down the front and noticed that her fingers were trembling. She went as slowly as possible trying to postpone the inevitable when she would actually have to remove her blouse. But far too quickly she found that she had undone the last button and so looked up at the two men hoping against hope for a reprieve but all she got was a smile and a raised eyebrow from the one who spoke English. Looking away she even more slowly started to remove her blouse. Kathy felt even worse, with her 38dd breasts she had always been more than a little self conscious about her chest and now possibly her worst nightmare was coming true. As Anne slipped her blouse over her shoulders and down off her arms Kathy finished unbuttoning hers. She looked desperately at Anne who was clutching her now removed blouse to her chest in a vain attempt to hide her 32B breasts. She watched as one of the men pointed to the car boot and very slowly Anne turned and placed the blouse in the boot. As she turned back she crossed her arms over her chest to try and hide herself from the men's gaze. Clad only in a white lacy bra and matching high cut knickers she began to nervously hop from foot to foot but the male eyes were now focused on Kathy. The large chested woman held her undone blouse closed in front of herself and looked at the men to see them both grinning and obviously looking forward to the imminent removal of this garment. For thirty seconds there was no movement or sound save a slight breeze rustling the hedgerows by the side of the road. Anne shivered, as she felt the cool breeze on her arms, Kathy, however, was more preoccupied. The stand off was broken after almost a minute when the taller man said,<br><br>
"Hurry up please." And when this only caused Kathy to look at the floor and shake her head he coughed and took a step closer towards her.<br><br>
"Leave her alone!" Anne snapped, coming to the aid of her friend and causing the man to stop in his tracks, "I'll help her" and with that she turned and began to help a very reluctant Kathy to disrobe. It took a bit of persuasion before Kathy actually let Anne help her and as soon as the blouse came off her arms were crossed over her chest as she stared red faced at the ground. Anne deposited the blouse in the car boot and then turned towards the men.<br><br>
" Have you finished now," she asked trying to sound defiant as Kathy continued to study her bare feet,<br><br>
"You seem to have got everything," she added with a touch of sarcasm. The two men gazed at the women stood in front of them clad only in bra and knickers. Both sets of underwear were white but there the similarities ended, Anne's lacy lightly built bra matched her knickers and was clearly a set. Kathy on the other hand was wearing, as one would expect, a more substantial bra and her knickers were somewhat bigger than her friends. They neither matched her bra nor were what one would consider attractive.<br><br>
"Can we have the bras now? The tall man asked which answered Anne's question about whether they had finished.<br><br>
"You must be joking," Anne recoiled in horror whilst Kathy just moaned in despair.<br><br>
"Er No.." the man replied, " Your bras please"<br><br>
"You can't mean it," Anne asked wide eyed.<br><br>
"Yes, we do," the man reaffirmed.<br><br>
"Shit," was all Anne could think of in reply and in defeat reached behind her back and undid her bra clasp. Turning her back to the men she quickly slipped out of it and tossed it into the car boot. Arms across her chest she stayed turned with her back to the men and looked over her shoulder towards them.
"Your turn," the man spoke to Kathy, "or would you like some assistance."<br><br>
"No," Kathy replied having regained some of her composure and almost feeling a trace of guilt that her friend was now topless and she wasn't. Slowly she turned her back on the men and shot a glance at Anne. She got a weak smile of encouragement from her friend in return and with heart pounding and fingers trembling she reached up to the catch of her front opening bra. With a bit of a struggle she undid it and briefly paused before letting the catch slip out of her grip and her large breasts to swing free. At this point she hastily stripped it off, dropped it at her feet and then tried to cover her chest with her arms. Like Anne she remained with her back to the men.<br><br>
"Would you like to turn round?" the man asked with a laugh.<br><br>
"No," Anne answered between gritted teeth, she had never felt so embarrassed in her life and wished they had heeded the warning that had been constantly given to them. Kathy also managed to mumble,<br><br>
"No thank you."<br><br>
"OK," the man replied, "Stay as you are, but take off your knickers"<br><br>
The two women looked at each other in despair, it was obvious this was going to happen but it made things no easier when they actually heard it. Anne shrugged and with a deep breath hooked her thumbs in her waistband and pulled her knickers straight down to her ankles and stepped out of them. She didn't bother to pick them up and didn't turn round. Kathy followed her lead but took longer as she steadfastly kept one arm over her breasts as she wriggle her last item of clothing down her legs. Like Anne she left her discarded knickers on the ground and kept her back to the men.<br><br>
"Thank you, ladies," the tall man said addressing the two completely naked women.<br><br>
Anne and Kathy's hearts then missed a beat as they heard the other man walking over to them but they breathed a sigh of relief when he bent down and retrieved their last items of clothing. He then put them in the car boot and turned to smile at the nude pair. Both Kathy and Anne looked in his direction, first at his leering face and then at their possessions in the car. Both felt like they were punched in the stomach when he slammed the boot shut separating them from even the sight of their clothes. Neither woman had ever felt so vulnerable in all their lives. Both were now stood, backs to the men, one arm over their chests and the other over their crotches. Their backs and bottoms were of course in full view of the men.<br><br>
"You can go now," the man, continued, "I think we have everything"<br><br>
"Yes you do," Kathy hissed between her teeth not looking forward to returning to the hotel in their present state. The two men started to get into their car but were halted by Anne.<br><br>
"Wait! our car is stuck." She cried<br><br>
The tall man translated for his comrade and both men came over to look at the Mercedes, the women shrinking back as they approached.<br><br>
"You are right," the tall man agreed.<br><br>
"At least you can help us get it out," Anne pleaded.<br><br>
Once again the man translated and there was a brief exchange in Polish before the man announced,<br><br>
"My friend and I have no intention of getting our shoes or clothes dirty."<br><br>
"But you can't leave us," Kathy wailed.<br><br>
"We could if we wanted," the man answered, but then added, " I will drive for you if you push."<br><br>
"W'w.wwwhat," Anne spluttered in amazement. "You expect us to push the car like this?"<br><br>
"I told you we aren't getting our clothes dirty and the grass is very muddy," the man replied and started to head to their car,<br><br>
"Hang on," Anne cried in desperation, "we'll do it."<br><br>
"We can't," Kathy hissed once again conscious of exposing her chest.<br><br>
"We don't have a choice," Anne muttered in reply and she was right as the tall man was already climbing behind the steering wheel. He started the engine and his accomplice gestured for the naked women to go to the front of the car. Still trying to cover themselves with their hands Kathy and Anne did as requested. The man was right when he said the verge was muddy as they felt how soft it was on their feet. It was clear there was no way they could cover themselves and push the car so very self consciously they put their hands on the bonnet, one woman at each side, and tried to dig their feet in to push. Both women kept their heads down their hair falling down in front of them, which was as much as they could do to obscure the sight of their dangling breasts from the man behind the wheel. The other man had a much better view and whilst his attention was mostly drawn to Kathy's unfettered chest he had time to notice that both women had rather neatly trimmed pubic hair. He engaged reverse and revved the engine, which the women took as their cue to push. A second later there were two screams as the wheels spun but did nothing except spray mud up the front of both women. In their haste to get out of the line of fire Kathy managed to fall over and then Anne tripped over her. The men laughed as the mud splattered pair got back to their feet.<br><br>
"Bastard," Anne muttered under her breath, suspicious that he had done that deliberately.<br><br>
"Try again," the man behind the wheel called out still laughing. This time both women had mud in their hair, which caused it to stick to their bodies, and thus afforded the driver an unrestricted view of two pairs of mud splattered breasts. As he revved the engine, this time in neutral he noticed that the vibrations from the bonnet were transmitted down the women's arms and caused their breasts to vibrate as well. He therefore spent a good minute experimenting with different engine speeds much to the consternation of the naked women, as they had no idea what was happening.<br><br>
"Put it in gear," Anne called, unaware of what he was really doing. Finally the man got back to the task in hand and engaged reverse once more. This time things were more successful and slowly the car began to move, suddenly, as it came away from the grass bank it had ended up leaning on it shot backwards causing both women to fall flat on their faces in a large muddy puddle that had been under the car.<br><br>
"Great!" Anne said wondering if things could get any worse as she picked herself up<br><br>
Behind them there was a squeal of tyres as the short man drove off in the men's car.<br><br>
The Mercedes pulled up along side them and the man addressed the two mud covered women kneeling naked in the puddle.<br><br>
"Thank you for your cooperation," he said out of the window.<br><br>
Neither woman replied,<br><br>
" There is one more thing," he continued,<br><br>
"Whats that?" Anne snapped despite her predicament.<br><br>
"I'm keeping the car as well," and with that he drove off up the road.<br><br>
In stunned disbelief Kathy Scott and Anne Dawson watched it disappear leaving them without money, possessions, clothes or transport in a foreign country where they didn't even speak the language. As they knelt in the puddle and covered in mud they both heartily wished they had stayed in their hotel that morning'..<br><br>
