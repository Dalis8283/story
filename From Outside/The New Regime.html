<p>It was Thursday; Thursdays always   seemed an anticlimax,     they weren&#8217;t
   Friday so you couldn&#8217;t look forward   to the weekend yet, and    Wednesdays
   were the day when you had passed the   summit of the week, &#8220;What    were
  Thursdays <i>for</i> she wondered?&#8221; Interrupting   her reverie Nina opened
    her locker and quickly slipped off her coat and   shoes. After placing
 her  coat on the coat hanger and putting her shoes on  the bottom shelf
of  the locker she turned to see how Helen was getting on.</p>
                     
<p>Helen was undoing her blouse.</p>
                     
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you bother with   all that. You know     you&#8217;re just
   going to have to undress anyway.&#8221;</p>
                     
<p>Helen sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think about it. I&#8217;m     still not comfortable
   with this; anyway you hardly wear clothes at all  nowadays!   So you&#8217;re
 used  to it.&#8221;</p>
                         
<p>Nina reflected that   Helen was probably      right; then she looked at
   her watch. &#8220;Hurry up! We&#8217;ve  still got to get   ready.&#8221;</p>
                      
<p>Helen glanced at her own watch and immediately stopped     dawdling and
   practically ripped the rest of her clothes off and threw them    in the
 locker.</p>
                     
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hang them up properly; you   don&#8217;t want to earn     a demerit for
   untidiness, if they get creased!&#8221;</p>
                     
<p>Helen nodded and quickly hung up   the rest of her clothes.     Nina turned
   to close her locker and glanced  again at the short notice that    had
been   stuck to the inside of their lockers:</p>

<p><br>
 As she read the notice through, she considered again        the stupidity
   of appealing the award of those final demerits last Friday!</p>
                                          
<p>Both she and Helen had endured Level 1 and 2 Sanctions        in the weeks
   since that fateful meeting.</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Ladies, would you join Donny and me in my office for a short meeting.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina and Helen looked at each other questioningly;        and reluctantly,
   they each pushed back their chairs and stood up. Helen      was  still
not   used to being nude; so she reached for a notepad and clasped      it
 to  her chest.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need to take notes,&#8221; said Sarah with a smile, &#8220;just come as
   you are!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Suppressing a shudder Helen put down her notepad and        followed Nina
   up the stairs to Sarah&#8217;s office.</p>
                                          
<p>As she entered, Donny came through the connecting door. Helen blushed
a deep rose as she noticed the appreciative look he gave her. She sat down
as quickly as she could and pulled her chair close to the table to maximise
the coverage that it gave her.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah remained standing whilst Nina and Donny made themselves comfortable.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Since the party a few weeks ago Donny and I have been thinking about
the implications of our new working arrangements for our discipline procedures.
   As the &#8216;Specialized Affairs&#8217; section we have a reputation to maintain,
so   we can&#8217;t have anything as mundane as fines or suspensions. Therefore
in consultation  with Donny (and others) I drew up this schedule.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Donny handed out copies of a single sheet document. Sarah carried on talking.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You need to read it first and then we can discuss        it and make
any changes that you all feel are reasonable.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen and Nina looked speculatively at each other;        &#8216;Was this the
   voice of reason; from the LegalLady?&#8217;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah continued. &#8220;Anyway I&#8217;ll get a charge out of knowing that you agreed
   to do these things, if you ever have to do them!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>That was more like it! Nina and Helen started to read.</p>
                                          
<p>When both Nina and Helen had finished studying the document, Sarah spoke
   again.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Right! The floor is now open for discussion.&#8221; and sat down. Nina was
first.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;This looks like a finished document, apart from the        odd &#8216;to be
   decided&#8217;. Are you willing to change any of it?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen nodded.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked thoughtful.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Look, I never like to present draft proposals, so        I&#8217;m sorry if
   this looks cut and dried. I did speak to Jim and Brian  too;     in fact
  Brian suggested the display sanction and levels 4 and upwards   were  
 Jim&#8217;s  idea &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>She thought for a moment, &#8220;&#8230; well I may have added        something to
   them. But the basic idea was his though. Anyhow, the answer       to your
   question is: yes it&#8217;s all up for grabs, apart from the main principle
      that is.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the main principle?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought I&#8217;d made that clear. The discipline        regime should
   be unusual, consensual and humiliating. I think that the    last   bit
is   essential otherwise there&#8217;s no deterrent is there?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah smiled and carried on.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tried to give you the chance to &#8216;make amends&#8217;        within the
   week. That&#8217;s why there are demerits and merits and we&#8217;ve  allowed    
 for   appeals too; note that the appeals committee is the rest  of us, so
  unless     you&#8217;ve really annoyed your co-worker you will have at  least
one  sympathetic     voice on the committee.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>In the end, of course, nothing substantive had been        changed and
   all of them had agreed to abide by the new regime. Even,   surprisingly,
      Sarah and Donny. Though less surprisingly neither of them   had earned
   a  single   demerit in the weeks that followed.</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>It had been nearly two weeks after the start of the        new regime
before either of the two paralegals had earned enough demerits        for
a sanction to be applied. And so it was Nina who had to suffer the    daily
  indignity of being shaved by Helen before she started work. (Actually 
  after   the first day of razor burn Nina decided that shaving meant any
  form  of depilation  and substituted a bikini-line depilatory cream.) However
  it  was still Helen&#8217;s  job to apply it and wash it off. The next week both
  of  them had earned a level one sanction and mutual depilation in the company
    showers each morning became the norm for the following week.</p>
                                          
<p>After that things settled down with both girls earning        enough merits
   to offset any demerits that they had earned. As they settled       into
 the  regime they became blas&eacute;. Two weeks ago Nina had earned a level
      two sanction; with Helen accompanying her with a level one. Even this
  had    not been too bad; the chains had been merely inconvenient. Then
had   come    that fateful Friday &#8230;</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>At first Nina had been sanguine about earning three       more demerits 
   until Helen pointed out that she had three demerits to  &#8216;carry     over&#8217; 
  from the current week. After a quick calculation she realised  that    she
  was only one demerit from a level three sanction!</p>
                                          
<p>Donny interrupted her reverie. &#8220;Nina. Where&#8217;s that       research on the 
   Palmer case. I need it for the three o&#8217;clock hearing  and    I want to 
read   through it.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina went very still. &#8220;I thought you meant next Friday;       I haven&#8217;t 
   started it as I thought I had plenty of time. I&#8217;m sorry; I&#8217;ll     get 
on   it right away though. I&#8217;m sure I can have something on your desk   
you can   use if I work through my lunch hour &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Donny looked cross. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother I'll get a continuance &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina looked relieved.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Meanwhile you can take two demerits to help you       to pay attention 
   to a partner when they ask you to do something.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not fair! It was an honest mistake! You       can&#8217;t give me 
   two demerits just for a simple mistake.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Are you appealing my award?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Yes. I can&#8217;t believe you would give me any demerits just for mishearing 
   you!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Donny looked thoughtful. &#8220;It&#8217;s your right of course, but I&#8217;d think twice 
   if I were you.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina had stuck to her guns; swept along be her own       sense of self-righteousness 
   and the fear of a level three sanction.</p>
                                          
<p>And it all seemed to be going her way; she had been       eloquent, cogent 
   and persuasive in arguing her point. Unfortunately it   had   all been 
brought   to nothing by a simple question from Donny directed    at Helen.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Could you tell me what I asked Nina to do first thing this morning?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You asked her to research the Palmer case and you       apologised for 
   the short notice, but you needed it first thing this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina looked despairingly at the other three. &#8220;Oh God you did!       I&#8217;m 
   so sorry Donny; I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking.&#8221;                    
       </p>
             
<p>Sarah spoke. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a formal vote is required,       since all 
   parties now seem to agree about the facts. You were awarded   two    demerits 
   and those will stand and along with the further two penalty   demerits 
   that brings you to &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;&#8230; 7 demerits for this week, Nina, plus 3 from last       week making a
grand total of 10!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Donny paused, he had only considered the implementation       of up to 
   level three sanctions and he wasn&#8217;t sure what to do about a  level    
four.   &#8220;I believe that&#8217;s a level four sanction. I&#8217;m not &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah smiled her best &#8216;cat who got the cream&#8217; smile       and interrupted. 
   &#8220;I have just the equipment we need!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina groaned inwardly; of course she did!</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;After the Tami Smithers case was completed I came       across the mark 
   two retainer device and nipple stimulators. I think they&#8217;ll      be just 
  the job for the arousal part of the sanction!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;OK I&#8217;m finished, let&#8217;s go and get ready.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen was carrying her chains and Nina lifted a box       from her locker 
   that contained her chains and the rest of the equipment.      They both 
 shut  their lockers and twirled the combinations. They would  be   unable 
 to open  them for the next eight hours or so; unless one of the  partners 
   gave them  permission.</p>
                                          
<p>They made their way to the shower room. As Helen required       less preparation 
   she went first. Sitting on the edge of the shower she    spread   her legs
   wide giving Nina an uninterrupted view of her vulva and    anus. Carefully
     Nina applied a thin film of the cream. As she did this   Helen&#8217;s colour
   darkened;   neither of them had yet got to the point where   they weren&#8217;t
   either embarrassed   or aroused by this procedure. Helen closed   her
eyes,    and then opened them   again as a jet of cold water from the shower
  landed    on her.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Oh! You &#8230;&#8221; words failed her.</p>
                                          
<p>Nina grinned. &#8220;Sorry. I was too quick; anyway that&#8217;s you done now.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen grimaced. The water had warmed up and they couldn&#8217;t       afford 
   the time to wait for it to cool down so she could return the compliment. 
       Anyway Helen had to fit the retainer device to Nina and that was embarrassing 
        enough for Nina. They swapped places and Helen ensured that Nina was
   hair-free     also.</p>
                                          
<p>Helen opened the box and removed a U shaped piece of clear plastic with 
   bumps and protrusions on the inner surface. This was the devilish refinement 
   of the retainer device that McMasters had produced for Tami Smithers to 
 wear.  Nina squatted down slightly, while Helen applied lubricant to the 
inner surface  of the U. She knelt down and pulling the upper ends of the 
U apart she gently  eased it between Nina&#8217;s opened legs. There were two larger 
stubby probes that met her anus and vagina. The longer of the two entered 
her vagina with little effort, but the anal probe required coordination on 
Nina&#8217;s part. However,  after three days practise they now had this down to 
a fine art. Next Helen  was required to ensure that Nina&#8217;s  vaginal lips were
well separated and located in specific channels on the inside of the U. Nina
groaned with embarrassment.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I have to do it.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina nodded. Helen adjusted the U so that Nina&#8217;s clitoris       was properly 
   located and then she checked to ensure that the final, tiny     probe was
   located just at the entrance to Nina&#8217;s urethra. She removed  a  clear 
plastic   belt from the box and threaded it through stiff loops at  the 
top of the   U. The belt was adjusted for Nina's waist and then locked  closed.
 Nina  stood up and groaned slightly as she felt the probes shift within
and  around  her. The device cruelly exposed her entire genital region; and
this  was only the beginning! Nina wondered again at the twisted genius that
had  devised   something that was both as shaming and arousing as this was.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Ok nearly done.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me! Just wait &#8217;til it&#8217;s your turn.&#8221; This       was said without 
   heat and Helen merely smiled. The outer door banged  and    a minute later 
   Sarah breezed into the shower room.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Hello ladies.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen glanced at her watch.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m just early,&#8221; said Sarah and stood       watching her 
   two paralegals as they finished their preparation.</p>
                                          
<p>Helen bent down to retrieve the longer of two plastic       probes. Quickly 
   she slathered lubricant on, privately she wondered why    she   bothered; 
   Nina produced enough of her own by this stage. Pressing  a  hidden   recessed 
   button caused the front probe to be loosened allowing  it  to twist   free.
   A collar of clear plastic kept Nina&#8217;s vagina open and  the  second longer
     probe slipped in without effort and clicked home. A similar  procedure
  with   the anal probe saw it replaced by something substantially    longer
  and heavier   than the original &#8216;locator&#8217; anal probe (though not  as  long
  as the vaginal   probe) and again it clicked home.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get you into your chains before I switch you on.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina nodded, unwilling to speak at this point until       she got used 
   to just how <i>invaded</i> and <i>exposed</i> she felt.  She    was grateful 
   to Helen for giving her this respite before she switched  on   the retainer. 
   All too soon the chains were fitted and Helen knelt down  and    pressed 
  a second small switch on the anal probe. Immediately Nina gasped   as the 
  retainer went live.</p>
                                          
<p>The inside of the U shape was lined with invisible       electrodes, that 
   both carried information to the CPU in the anal probe    and   stimulating 
   charges from the CPU to her most sensitive places. The   probe  within 
her   vagina opened out into some sort of demented Christmas  tree shape 
and extended  to ensure close contact with her cervix and various  other spots
 within her vagina including the one most commonly known as the  &#8220;G&#8221; spot.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it like?&#8221; Sarah asked with frank curiosity.</p>
                                          
<p>Nina took a shuddering breath, &#8220;Be my guest.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;No, seriously, how does it feel?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Like I have a watermelon inside me! It doesn&#8217;t hurt       or anything, 
   but it seems to be touching me everywhere.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Oops! I forgot the nipple stimulators!&#8221; said Helen       and with more 
   haste than care she attached them to Nina&#8217;s highly aroused      nipples.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; the CPU in the device recognised the new peripherals       and immediately
restarted the calibration process.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I really &#8230; uhh &#8230; oooohhhhh &#8230; hate it when &#8230; oh God! You do that!&#8221; moaned 
   Nina.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221; said Helen with a slight smile; the cold water had been repaid 
   with interest!</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Oww!&#8221; the self-test over, the device had recognised       that Nina&#8217;s 
   arousal level was greater than the value pre-programmed by   the   remote 
   control and had taken steps to reduce it!</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah leaned over and picked up the remote control       for the retainer 
   from the box and looked at the display. &#8220;You really  ought     not to leave
   it set at level zero!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Actually I prefer to get it over with straight away.       At any other 
   level I can&#8217;t concentrate properly. Since you&#8217;re here and    I  have 45 
 minutes  of mandatory display time still to do can I do 15 minutes      of
 it before  we start work?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Donny&#8217;ll be disappointed though; he likes watching you cum!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina blushed darkly at this reminder.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Still, perhaps he should get to work earlier. Don&#8217;t forget Helen&#8217;s chains 
   though, I believe she&#8217;s still serving a level two sanction.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>It was the work of a moment to attach Helen&#8217;s wrist       and ankle cuffs 
   and a minute later the odd procession left the shower   area    and made 
  their way to the raised dais that had been placed in the   centre   of the
  work area that was part of the ground floor. It was padded   and three 
 small depressions in the padding showed where Nina&#8217;s knees and   feet had 
 been  placed over the last three days. A small countdown clock,  like those 
 used  in chess matches, showed 45. Only when Nina was properly  in position 
 could  Helen press the button that started the timer.</p>
                                          
<p>Reluctantly Nina got into position; knees widespread;       hands interlinked 
   on the back of her neck. Offhand she couldn&#8217;t think   of   a position that
   exposed her more thoroughly, at least one that didn&#8217;t   involve    medical
   equipment anyway. Helen pressed the timer button. The  small sound   
interrupted    Nina&#8217;s pleasant daydream of what it would be like  to have
Sarah    in this   position.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah gave the remote control Helen. &#8220;Start her on       level two for 
   five minutes, then level four for the next five &#8230; no seven      minutes, 
  and level five for the last three.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen looked sympathetically at Nina. &#8220;O.K., you&#8217;re       the boss.&#8221; Usually 
   they left the stimulation until the last few minutes     of  Nina&#8217;s display 
   period; the sanction said nothing about continuous arousal      only that 
   she should achieve at least one orgasm during each display period.    
Helen   turned the dial on the remote until it read &#8220;2&#8221;.</p>
                                          
<p>Insidiously the device started to arouse Nina; she       felt small feathery 
   touches around her nipples and along her vaginal  lips.     Next the probes 
   within her started to undulate and she felt stronger  caresses     around 
   her &#8220;G&#8221; spot. Now the sensations were getting stronger  and Nina  felt 
  herself accelerating towards orgasm &#8230; and then the sensations  stopped. 
 The   device had raised her arousal level and would now maintain  it until 
   told  to do otherwise. Helplessly Nina thrust her hips back and  forth 
in  a vain  effort to achieve some further stimulation; she looked pleadingly 
    at Helen.  Helen shrugged her shoulders and looked at Sarah.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Nina, only 12 more minutes to go!&#8221; said       Sarah smiling 
   brightly and with that she sprang youthfully up the stairs      to her 
office.</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Uhhhhhhhhhhh&#8221; Nina moaned gently as another feathery       touch on her 
   clitoris and around her urethra caused her hips to undulate      once more.
   Suddenly further stimulation occurred as Helen turned the dial     from
 2  to 4. Once more the touches came thick and fast, but more strongly  
  now.  Nina&#8217;s thoughts grew more disconnected as her concentration turned 
  inward    and she was unaware that her audience had grown by one as Donny 
  came into    the office.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;How much longer has she got?&#8221; He asked Helen.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Another 4 minutes at level four and then 3 minutes       at level 5.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Sarah&#8217;s already here then I presume?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;How did you guess?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>This conversation took place over a background of heartfelt moans and grunts,
as Nina was kept mercilessly at the high level of arousal dictated by the
device, without ever being allowed the release of orgasm. Nina&#8217;s face, chest
and breasts were now noticeably flushed and perspiration collected between
her breasts and flowed unevenly down her stomach, driven by her ragged breathing.</p>
                                          
<p>Finally the seven minutes were up and Helen turned       the dial round 
   to &#8220;5&#8221; and watched with fascination as her friend was  washed     helplessly 
   into one long three-minute orgasm. Frantically thrusting  her   hips  backwards
   and forwards as her body was driven to react in a primeval     fashion
 to  the relentless stimulation provided by the device; Nina was   driven
 from   crest to crest.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah leaned over the balcony. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s enough       for now. Be 
   careful how you bring her down.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen nodded and over the final minute of her fifteen-minute       display 
   period she turned the dial back to zero.</p>
                                          
<p> &#8220;Nina, my office in ten minutes please,&#8221; Sarah&#8217;s voice floated down from 
   the balcony.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Yes Sarah.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>She climbed unsteadily down from the dais and took the towel that Helen 
   offered her.</p>
                                          
<p>Another day at the office had begun!</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having a visit from a prospective new client       later this morning,&#8221; 
   said Sarah as Nina came in. &#8220;His name is Crown Prince      Nasim; his father
   is the Sultan of some tin pot Arab principality that&#8217;s     nothing but
sand   and oil. I need you to do some general research on him   and  his
country.   He&#8217;s due here by 11:00, so I need something by 10:00.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;OK. I&#8217;ll get right on it.&#8221; Nina turned to leave.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;That was quite a show just now; I hope you&#8217;re not       getting too tired 
   by all the exertion.&#8221; Sarah couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity       to embarrass
   her assistant and watched with interest as Nina coloured   up   and stammered
   a reply.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;N &#8230; no I can cope, thanks.&#8221; And left quickly before       Sarah could 
   twist the knife still further.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; There isn&#8217;t much on the man himself. He was educated       in England
    at Eton and Oxford University &#8211; Magdalene College.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked up; she had been reading a copy of Nina&#8217;s  notes. &#8220;Is that
    pronunciation correct?&#8221;(Nina  had pronounced it &#8216;maudlin&#8217;.)</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I remembered someone telling me about it from       a trip round
    Europe. The British have some really strange names that  are    pronounced
    nothing like the way they are spelt. Like &#8216;Featherstonehaugh&#8217;     and
&#8216;Cholmondely&#8217;    should be said &#8216;Fanshaw&#8217; and &#8216;Chumley&#8217;. It&#8217;s weird; but
   they&#8217;re British    so what do you expect?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina carried on.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;The place seems to be floating       on crude oil. They call it the &#8216;champagne
    of crude oils&#8217; because it needs      so little refining.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina looked up from her notes. Sarah nodded for her to continue.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;The country has very close ties with the UK; they&#8217;ve       modelled their
    health, education and welfare services on the British  and    their political
    system too. They have an elected body which is where  the   real power
 rests   and then an un-elected second body made up of the royal  family
and  assorted   Sheiks.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina paused and looked up. &#8220;The next bit is really       strange; they
    don&#8217;t have any written laws and they don&#8217;t allow lawyers.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked shocked. &#8220;They must have laws. The place       would be like
    the Wild West without laws!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;They do have laws, and courts, and judges. I said       they don&#8217;t have
    any <i>written</i> laws. Apparently the grandfather or   great-grandfather
      of the Sultan had a bad experience with an American  Oil  company back
   at the  end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and reckoned  that  lawyers
were   a &#8216;bad thing&#8217;. He also decided that the written law was  also  a &#8216;bad
thing&#8217;.    I couldn&#8217;t find out why. Apart from that the place sounds   like
a paradise.    The money from the oil is split two ways. Half goes to pay
 for the infrastructure    and the other half is divided equally amongst
the population! There&#8217;s less    than a 100,000 of them and so everyone is
very well off and there&#8217;s no taxation.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked shocked. No lawyers; no taxation how could the place work
    at all?</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;As Nina knows we have an important prospective client       arriving
in 10 minutes or so. I&#8217;ve called in a favour or two and discovered      
that he&#8217;s well into the &#8216;lifestyle&#8217; as a dominant; so it&#8217;s lucky that   both
   of you happen to be in chains.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked speculatively at Helen and Nina, who were sitting at their
    desks in the main area.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;While he&#8217;s here I&#8217;d like you two to behave submissively.       No sitting
    on the furniture. Kneeling in the display position when you&#8217;re      
not    occupied with work &#8230; that sort of thing. O.K. Carry on.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen looked stricken. But before she could say anything       though
Donny took pity on her and asked her to start tidying the library.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah spoke again. &#8220;Move your chair (and Helen&#8217;s) into the meeting area
    and move a couple of the footstools next to your desks; you can kneel
on   them for the time being.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina nodded and started to do as she was asked. &#8220;After       you&#8217;ve done
    that I think you have time for another fifteen minutes display      
time,     don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Not trusting herself to say anything Nina hurried to swap the chairs and
    the footstools and get into position on the dais. If she were lucky then
   she might just have finished before the Prince arrived;       once settled
   she called to Helen to come and start the timer.</p>
                                          
<p>Less than a minute had gone by before Nina heard the       sound that
she had been dreading: the sound of the outer front door open     warning.
Sarah leaned over the balcony and called to Helen. &#8220;Go and welcome     our
guests and bring them to the meeting area; remember to be demure!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8216;Demure!&#8217; thought Helen. &#8216;I&#8217;m naked and in chains! How can I be demure?&#8217;</p>
                                          
<p>Specialised Affairs had no receptionist, although they did have a large
    foyer. The outer doors were linked to a chime and were glazed with one-way
    glass so the foyer was hidden from the gaze of passers-by. The inner
door     could only be opened from the inside. With some trepidation Helen
went  to   greet the Prince. She could see from the CCTV screen by the inner
door  that   he wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep the Prince waiting Helen!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Steeling herself and blushing deeply, Helen opened the inner door.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Welcome to Specialised Affairs. Will you follow me       please, Sir?&#8221;
    Being careful to keep her eyes lowered she held the door    open   as
the    Prince and his retinue entered.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;This is a most pleasant welcome. It almost reminds       me of home!&#8221;
    The Prince spoke in the clipped accent of the English upper      classes.
    &#8220;I believe I have an appointment with Ms. Sarah Wickland and  Mr.   
Donald     Bell? In the meantime however, and in view of your attire, would
 you  excuse   me for a moment?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Turning to the two smaller members of his party. &#8220;You       may revert
    to standard dress code.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen watched wide-eyed with curiosity as the two quickly opened their
    long robes to reveal that underneath they were naked. Surprisingly they
  were  not both women as she had assumed from her quick glance at the TV
monitor,    but a man and a woman. Most definitely one of them was a man
as eight inches    of erect penis was revealed. &#8220;Take their robes please
Hamid.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Turning back to Helen the Prince asked. &#8220;Could you       tell my driver
    where he may put the robes while we are here?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Weakly Helen gestured towards the coat rack that stood       near the
door. &#8220;There are also lockers if you would prefer, Sir.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;These will be fine. Wait here please Hamid.&#8221; Hamid       nodded and placed
    the robes on hangers. Meanwhile Helen started to lead     the  Prince
and    his two &#8230; slaves she supposed that they were, to the meeting     area
 where   Sarah and Donny waited impatiently.</p>
                                          
<p>For once Sarah seemed unsure of herself. The Prince       was a tall and
    imposing figure and the sight of his naked retinue was   unusual    to
 say   the least. Extending her hand towards the Prince she said.   &#8220;Welcome.
    I&#8217;m Sarah the senior partner here and this is Donny my assistant.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince took her hand and bowed over it. &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted       to meet
    you both.&#8221; He shook hands with Donny and, gesturing to his two    naked
    companions, said, &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind me taking advantage of  your
 dress    code?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;No that&#8217;s perfectly O.K. That&#8217;s one of the reasons       that Specialised
    Affairs is in a separate building now. Would you like    a  drink before
   we start?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Not at the moment.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Helen, Nina has 10 minutes to go, could you put her       on level three
    for 5 minutes; level four for 3 minutes and level five   for    the last
   two minutes.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen nodded and turned to go.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Oh I&#8217;m sorry I forgot, this is Helen one of our paralegal       assistants.&#8221;
    Sarah introduced Helen who blushed again to be the centre    of   attention.
    &#8220;If you would step this way I will introduce you to Nina   the final
 member    of our team.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Stepping around the partition brought them to work       area, which was
    dominated by the sight of Nina kneeling on the dais.  Her    hands were
  resting  on the nape of her neck and her knees were spread  wide.    Helen
  hurried  to the desk and picked up the remote control. Nina  stared  pleadingly
    at Sarah. The blush that had heated her face now deepened  and  spread
 to her  breasts. Then Helen turned the dial to three. Her mortification
   was complete  as she was helpless to prevent the rising tide of her arousal
    from making  her hips undulate erotically and she moaned with shame and
    lust.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;This is Nina our second paralegal.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;She is most decorative. I presume there is a reason for her being like
    this?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;She is suffering the consequences of some poor performances       last
    week. We felt that our disciplinary procedures needed to be somewhat
      more &#8230; ah creative in our section and this is the result.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince walked slowly around the suffering paralegal.       Nina had
    thought that she had tasted the very depths of shame and humiliation
      the first time she had been made to orgasm and it hadn&#8217;t seemed to
get      any   easier as the week progressed, but at least she had only been
seen       by Sarah,   Donny and Helen. Now she realised it had been nothing.
This     was  a whole order  of magnitude worse!</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;A most entertaining device. Where did you get it?&#8221;       Sarah explained
    some of the history of the retainer. During which Helen     turned  the
  dial  from three to four.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Uhhhhhhhhh.&#8221; A moan escaped from Nina, level four was almost intolerable.
    Coherent thought was prevented as incessant touches  and vibrations to
 her  most sensitive and erogenous zones kept her at that     delicious state 
  of  near orgasm without allowing her to achieve it.</p>
                                          
<p>Further discussion tailed off as Helen moved the dial       from four
to five and once more Nina was pushed over the edge as orgasm     after 
orgasm was helplessly wrenched from her; panting and groaning she    made
an  arresting sight. With a nod from Sarah, Helen started to lower  Nina&#8217;s
  arousal  level.</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince spoke again. &#8220;I particularly like the exposure       that the
    device gives; it&#8217;s not often that it&#8217;s possible to have such   a  clear
   view.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>By this time Nina&#8217;s arousal level was close to zero       and now her
humiliation was complete. Here was a total stranger closely     examining
 here sexual organs after having witnessed her in the throes of an extended
 orgasm! Could things get any worse?</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah leant forward and stopped the timer. &#8220;Say &#8216;hello&#8217; to the Prince,
    Nina.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Yes!</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Hello, Your Highness.&#8221; Keeping her eyes lowered submissively Nina greeted
    the Prince.</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince gently raised her head with his finger. &#8220;There&#8217;s no need for 
   such formality. &#8216;Sir&#8217; is quite sufficient!&#8221; Nasim    winked   broadly as
  he said this and Nina saw that his eyes twinkled merrily.    She  smiled 
 back  disarmed by his obvious self-parody.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;As you wish &#8230; Sir.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Right! Let&#8217;s get to it shall we? Nina would fetch       the blue file
    from my desk and bring it to the meeting area. Don&#8217;t forget       your
 notebook   we will need notes to be taken.&#8221; Sarah spoke briskly.</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince spoke, &#8220;Our laws don&#8217;t allow written records       when legal
    matters are involved. Would you mind if our meeting was videoed?&#8221;   
   He  looked at Nina, taking Sarah&#8217;s acceptance for granted. Nina looked
  confused,     was he really asking her for permission? &#8220;You can rest assured
    that the  video  record won&#8217;t be viewed by anyone, unless we become involved
    in a dispute   with your firm, and only then if the trial takes place
in    my country.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Uhh that&#8217;s O.K. I guess.&#8221; Nina turned to do as she had been asked.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; The prince reached into his pocket and       removed a small
    but expensive digital video camera and held it out to   his    two naked
   companions. As the girl took the camera the Prince&#8217;s watch   beeped. 
  The  Prince turned to Sarah. &#8220;I have certain rituals that I required  
my  slaves    to perform at certain times. Would you object if they performed
   them here?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah shrugged. &#8220;Of course. Go right ahead.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;As you can see I require my male slaves to exhibit       their arousal
    at all times; unfortunately it&#8217;s difficult to exact a similar      requirement
    for female slaves, so each hour I insist that they are aroused      almost
    to orgasm. Since I don&#8217;t have access to such technology as you  appear
    to; I prefer to use a more &#8230; <i>direct</i> approach! Proceed!&#8221;  This
last       was directed to the two naked slaves.</p>
                                          
<p>With an air of resignation the girl placed the camera       on the nearest
    desk and then bent forward, arched her back and spread   her    legs.
The    boy stood behind her and placed his penis at the entrance   to her
  sex.    With a smooth and firm thrust he entered her. The girl&#8217;s head 
 rose and    her eyes opened wide, and then closed as she smiled enigmatically.
  The   boy  started to thrust regularly and the silence of the office was
broken       with  the &#8216;slap &#8211; slap&#8217; of the front of his thighs contacting
the back    of   hers.  The boy leant forward and started to pinch and tease
his partner&#8217;s        nipples.  This elicited a moan.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Of course neither of them may achieve orgasm without       permission;
    the penalties can be quite severe if they do.&#8221; The prince   looked  
 speculatively    at his two slaves. &#8220;Though I do believe that they   occasionally
   fail   on purpose!&#8221; The two slaves managed to look both aroused   and
bashful    at the same time. The Prince&#8217;s watch beeped again and the  Prince
signalled      his two slaves to stop. The boy withdrew from the girl  who
turned round     and  knelt before him and started to suck clean his penis.
 The boy groaned.     &#8220;Stop  teasing him! Esme!&#8221; The girl stopped what she
was  doing and stood    up. &#8220;Now  where were we?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina had, by this time, returned and led the way to       the meeting
area. Waiting for Sarah and the Prince to be seated she knelt      with her
knees spread wide and waited with her notepad and pencil poised.</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>The meeting went well and the Prince decided that,      on the basis of
     their obvious competence as well as their acceptance of   his  lifestyle,
     he would be retaining their services. Nina was dispatched    to prepare
    an agreement for everyone to sign. On her return the Prince  dropped
  his   bombshell.  &#8220;You realise, of course, that a written agreement  is
not  considered   legally  binding in my country? We will also have to have
 a video  record   of both of  us speaking the terms of the agreement and
agreeing  to  be bound  by them. We need two witnesses one chosen by each
party &#8230; and  finally  we  all have to be naked. It&#8217;s supposed to be symbolic
of having nothing to  hide.&#8221; The Prince shrugged apologetically, &#8220;What can
I say; Great-Granddad     was a barbarian!&#8221;  This last was said in a tone
of voice that said precisely     the opposite. &#8220;It  does make our courts
interesting places to visit though!&#8221;       The Prince raised  his voice slightly.
&#8220;Hamid! I need you to witness  an   agreement.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina was delighted! Just for once the Sarah and Donny      would be experiencing
     something of what she and Helen felt every day!</p>
                                          
<p>Both the Prince and Hamid undressed with an efficiency      and lack of
     modesty that suggested a long familiarity with this requirement.   
  Sarah    and Donny were more tentative; but eventually all parties and
witnesses         to the agreement were ready. Thankfully the agreement was
short; it   became       obvious now why the Prince had insisted on simple,
easily memorable     sentences;      as they had to speak the agreement without
referring to   the  written version.      Finally all parties and witnesses
signed the original    document. Both legal     systems satisfied, the camera
was turned off and    everyone who was allowed     to, got dressed.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Well that was &#8230; interesting.&#8221; Said Donny, &#8220;You did      promise me that
     working for you wouldn&#8217;t be boring!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Well what can I say, I always keep my promises.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;May I ask who your supplier was for the device that      Nina is wearing?&#8221;
     The Prince interrupted. Everyone automatically turned    to  look at
Nina     who blushed, as she was again the centre of attention.  She  wasn&#8217;t
 normally     this sensitive; but the device&#8217;s presence was a continual 
  reminder  and   she couldn&#8217;t shake off the feeling of <i>exposure.</i></p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Yes of course, I&#8217;ll let you have their details before      you go. Would
     you like a demonstration of all the features?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;That would be most diverting.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Reluctantly Nina moved back to the dais at Sarah&#8217;s      request. She just
     knew that things were going to get seriously embarrassing      before
 the    session was over.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;As you can see it&#8217;s made of a clear plastic. This      makes it easier
     to fit the device properly. Because each person is different      there
   is  an initial fitting process and then the plastic is &#8216;set&#8217;. It&#8217;s   
not     difficult;  we did it by using the shower, as long as you&#8217;re careful
  with  the spray  it&#8217;s not too difficult. You have to get it over 40&deg;
centigrade.       The whole  process only took a half hour from start to
finish. That&#8217;s   right     isn&#8217;t  it Nina?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Yes, about that.&#8221; Nina had been coping with the humiliation      by withdrawing
     mentally from the situation. Sarah&#8217;s question had forced    her  back
 to   the here-and-now in a most unwelcome fashion. She blushed again.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand all of the technical details, but it uses body heat
     and movement to keep the internal batteries charged. I think the nipple
   stimulators  have to be recharged separately; but that&#8217;s simple you just
  stick them in  a special charging unit for a couple of hours. I think you
  get a week or ten days use from a single charge. The main unit uses that
 cell-phone technology  &#8230; sharks tooth &#8230; something like that anyway, to communicate
 with the nipple  stimulators.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Bluetooth&#8221; Nina was again forced into the present      as she responded
     to her boss&#8217;s deliberate mistake.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Thanks. The remote is simplicity itself. There are      really only two
     controls. This dial gives you five levels of arousal,  well    six I
suppose     if you count zero, from slightly aroused which is level  one.&#8221;
   Sarah   turned  the dial to one as she spoke. Nina&#8217;s sharp intake of 
breath   and   deepening  colour showed her renewed shame. &#8220;All the way through
 to orgasm      at level  five.&#8221; Surprisingly Sarah didn&#8217;t suit her action
to  her words   and   Nina  was left suffering the occasional touch and vibration
  of level   one.  After  a minute or so she turned the dial back to zero.
 &#8220;The  second   control  is  the hidden under this sliding cover.&#8221; Sarah
slid  open the cover   to reveal   a small button, coloured red. &#8220;This starts
the  device&#8217;s self-test   and calibration    routine. You have to do this
the first time you use it   on someone. It takes    about five minutes.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina looked at Sarah with horror! She wasn&#8217;t going      to press it was
     she? Nina remembered the first time she had worn the device     last
Friday.     The humiliation as Helen had fumbled about fitting the device
    for the    first time, the shame and arousal as she had adjusted her
vaginal     lips    into the recesses &#8230; and then that awful five-minute &#8216;calibration&#8217;
   period,      as the instructions had so euphemistically put it.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah pressed the button.</p>
                                          
<p>One by one each separate stimulation device and electrode      was activated
     starting at its minimum setting and ramping up until the   stimulation
    became slightly painful. Most of the time Nina was able to  resist giving
     Sarah the satisfaction of seeing any obvious effect; but the  clitoral
  and   urethral stimulators caused her to moan and jerk. All this time Nina
  was  dreading the final phase where the device would bring her to orgasm
 three  times each time refining its control of her erogenous zones. After
 two minutes  the self-test was over and the final calibration phase started.
 Nina was overwhelmed, as she was stimulated to an extremely quick orgasm.
 A barrage of tiny electric shocks dropped her arousal level to zero. &#8220;Oww!&#8221;
 The Prince and Sarah were watching Nina intently and Nina felt the full
force  of her humiliation without the buffer of her arousal. &#8220;Uhhh.&#8221; The
device had started the second of its &#8216;calibration orgasms&#8217;. This one, Nina
was able to recall from last time, explored the depths of her responses.
Conscious thought deserted her as the device brought her to a second orgasm
this one was more shattering and she was unable to control herself as she
grunted and thrust her hips in helpless abandon. As the device dropped her
arousal level to zero for the second time. She felt her face flame, as she
seemed to blush all the way to her toes.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Did you know that blushing is confined to exposed      skin? When you&#8217;re
     dressed only your face is involved, when you&#8217;re nude   a  blush can
involve      the whole body.&#8221; Sarah addressed the Prince.</p>
                                          
<p>Nina&#8217;s colour intensified and then all further thought      on her part
     was forgotten as the device built her up over the final minute     
and    half  to her third and final orgasm. The last orgasm was the device&#8217;s
    final  test of its control over the wearer&#8217;s responses. Each arousal
level        was  reached and held for ten seconds as the program in the
device checked        that its control was complete. Level five was held
for the final twenty      five  seconds as the device completed its final
checks. Throughout this    impersonal    testing Nina was helpless to resist
the waterfall of arousal    as she was  swept  along into a final series
of orgasms that left her slumped    bonelessly  on her side.</p>
                                          
<p align="center">.oOo.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah retrieved the towel that Helen had brought down earlier and handed
     it to Nina, who listlessly wiped the perspiration from her body. How
did    the saying go? &#8216;Horses sweat, men perspire, women glow.&#8217; This random
thought    occupied her for a few seconds whilst she put off contemplating
   what  had  just happened. The first time it had only been Helen who had
witnessed     the &#8216;self-test&#8217; as Sarah had left after she had supervised
the initial  fitting.    This time though &#8230; she consciously redirected her
thoughts away  from the   abyss of shame that awaited her in that direction.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Fascinating! Of course I&#8217;d like to see the whole thing from start to
finish. If you don&#8217;t mind?&#8221; The Prince provided a welcome interruption of
her, increasingly unwelcome, thoughts.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I think that can be arranged. Hel&#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need to trouble your other assistant.      Perhaps you
     would model the device yourself?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Well I hadn&#8217;t &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ve made a &#8216;reasonable request&#8217; under the terms of our agreement
     don&#8217;t you?&#8221; The Prince&#8217;s eyes glittered and his face took on a dangerous
    cast, it was surprising how quickly the temperature appeared to be much
  lower  than the 23&deg;C that the air-conditioning had been set to.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked toward Donny for support.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we wouldn&#8217;t want to offend the Prince this      early in our
     relationship would we?&#8221; Said Donny, she wasn&#8217;t getting any    from 
him;     she&#8217;d gone too far this time.</p>
                                          
<p>With a resigned sigh and a look that didn&#8217;t bode anyone      well in the
     future, Sarah started to remove her clothes once again. &#8220;Nina      would
    you get one of the spare devices from my office, they&#8217;re filed under
    &#8216;Miscellany&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina scurried away to do as she was bid.</p>
                                          
<p>By the time Nina had returned, Sarah was naked once     more.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be depilated Sarah, otherwise it won&#8217;t fit properly.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Fine. Let&#8217;s get on with it shall we. Please excuse     us for five minutes 
     or so whilst we attend to it.&#8221; This last was direct   at  the Prince.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Lead on MacDuff. I think I need to see <i>all</i>     of the process, 
     don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah gritted her teeth and nodded. For the second     time that day a 
     strange procession made its way across the office; this   time  towards 
   the  showers. Once there, with a skill born of many weeks practise    
Nina   soon  had Sarah as smooth as the proverbial newborn baby. Throughout 
   the  process  the Prince and Donny had been interested spectators and Sarah&#8217;s
    colour  had stayed a fetching shade of pink.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You need to stand with your legs spread at least shoulder width apart 
     and with your knees bent slightly.&#8221; Said Nina. She opened the package 
 and    removed the device. In its &#8216;unfitted&#8217; state it was a lot less stiff. 
 Checking    that both locator probes were present she opened a tube of lubricant 
 and   spread it all over the inner surface of the device. While Sarah was 
 getting   into position Nina fitted the belt through the loops and adjusted 
 it to so  that it should just fit over Sarah&#8217;s hips. Threading Sarah&#8217;s legs 
 through   the large loops thus created she brought the device into contact 
 with Sarah&#8217;s    vagina. Gently spreading her lips Nina pushed the first locator
 probe firmly    into Sarah.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Ahhh.&#8221; Sarah was unable to contain a sigh as the vaginal probe was seated 
     within her. Nina then brought the anal probe up and behind Sarah and 
pressed     gently between her ass cheeks.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Bear down, like you&#8217;re going to the bathroom,&#8221; said     Nina. Sarah&#8217;s 
     face flamed carmine as she obeyed her assistant and she felt    the anal
    probe settle within her anal passage.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Almost done now,&#8221; said Nina gently. She knew how shaming this procedure 
     was and, while she was cross with Sarah for running the self-test, she 
  still   felt some sympathy for Sarah, having been through this herself. 
Sarah  looked   at Nina gratefully. Then she moaned softly as Nina gently 
widened  the separation   of her vaginal lips and settled them into the recesses 
of  the device; then   again as Nina settled the clitoral and urethral stimulators 
  into position.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;If you could hold the front in place while I tighten     the belt.&#8221; Nina 
     suited her actions to her words and made sure the belt  was   fastened 
  tightly.   &#8220;You have to have it tight the first time or else  everything 
   slips and   you have to start again.&#8221; This was said from bitter  experience 
   and she  shuddered slightly at the memory of it. &#8220;Now you step  carefully 
  into  the  shower and I will spray it with hot water.&#8221; She turned  to the 
  onlookers.   &#8220;It&#8217;s a simple process, you spray it with water at over  40&deg;C, 
  you just have  to make sure that you spray everywhere and water has  to 
get  to the inside  as well as the outside.&#8221; Turning to the shower controls 
 she  set the thermostat   to 45&deg;C and started to spray the device with
 water  from the shower.</p>
                                          
<p>After 5 minutes of spraying the device externally Nina gently directed 
     the water inside the device. This caused Sarah to gasp and wriggle, as
  the   water was quite hot for such an intimate place. Another few minutes 
  saw the  heating complete and Nina closed off the shower. She tapped the 
 front of the device with her knuckle. &#8220;As you can hear, the hardening   
 process has finished; next we dry off the device (and Sarah) and then we 
  will fit the active probes and the nipple stimulators.&#8221; Suiting her actions 
   to her words, Nina grabbed a clean towel and carefully dried off the device 
   and the bits of Sarah that had got wet. Sarah stepped out of the shower. 
  &#8220;Next I&#8217;ll fit the nipple stimulators, you&#8217;ll feel some pressure but it 
doesn&#8217;t    hurt and you soon stop noticing it; most of the time anyway!&#8221; This
last  was  spoken to Sarah as she fitted the stimulators. &#8220;Finally we&#8217;ll fit
the  active  probes.&#8221; She released the front locator probe and reached for
the  active vaginal probe.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Do you mind? I would like to see how the probe is     fitted,&#8221; said the 
     Prince. &#8220;Oh I see there&#8217;s a collar of plastic that keeps     the vagina 
   open  when the locator probe is removed. Fascinating you can  see   most 
  of the  interior of the vagina.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah&#8217;s colour deepened and spread at this reminder     of her exposure. 
     Meanwhile Nina had lubricated the vaginal probe and clicked     it home. 
    Removing the final probe and inserting the active anal probe took    a
 few   moments more and the Prince ensured that Sarah&#8217;s sense of shame was
    heightened    by further comments on the pinkness of the interior of
her  rectum.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re ready for the initial calibration. We&#8217;d     best go somewhere 
     where the floor is softer as it gets very intense. You    also should 
 be   sitting or kneeling before we start.&#8221; Sarah nodded, not trusting   
herself   to speak; by this time her whole body was a flaming scarlet blush.</p>
                                          
<p>Even switched off the retainer was stimulating; &#8216;how     did Nina manage 
     with this all day?&#8217;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Kneeling on this dais would be best don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;     said the Prince 
     as they approached the area where Nina had been kneeling    when the 
Prince     had first seen her. Sarah climbed unsteadily onto the dais    and
settled     into position; unconsciously spreading her knees so that the
  fitted into    the depressions that Nina had made. Reaching around her,
Nina   located   the  hidden switch on the anal probe and pressed it. Sarah
gasped  as the   vaginal  probe opened out and extended.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You were wrong! It feels like a pumpkin!&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina was cheered by this show of bravado on Sarah&#8217;s part; she&#8217;d been worried 
     by Sarah&#8217;s docility. Nina steeled herself for  the final act.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I believe I would like to &#8216;do the honours&#8217; don&#8217;t y&#8217;know!&#8221; and so saying 
     the Prince plucked the remote from Nina&#8217;s grasp and sliding open the 
hidden     compartment he pressed the red button.</p>
                                          
<p>With morbid fascination, and not a little lust, they  watched as Sarah&#8217;s 
        erotic responses were put through their paces. First there  were the
   unexpected     gasps and grunts as the individual stimulators were ramped
    up to a point     were the stimulation was almost painful. Next was the
  test of Sarah&#8217;s orgasmic    response to maximum stimulation. Thirdly there
  was the test of how deeply    the device could cause her orgasm to be and
  finally was the test of the  device&#8217;s  ability to hold each arousal level
  in turn. After the first orgasm  Sarah&#8217;s  helplessness and shame had seemed
  total but the second orgasm had  shown her  that there were entire vistas
  of humiliation still to be experienced   and the third orgasm had shown
her  that there was a whole <i>world</i> of   humiliation  and shame to be
experienced  of which she had previously known   nothing. Finally  the endless
five minutes  had been completed and Sarah found  herself lying  in the recovery
position  on the floor.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;You fainted, but we managed to catch you before you fell onto the floor. 
        How do you feel?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Tired, Nina &#8230;&#8221; Sarah took a deep breath this wasn&#8217;t  easy for her, &#8220;I&#8217;m 
        &#8230; oh this is so trite! &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for putting you through  this earlier.
        If I&#8217;d known it was like that I wouldn&#8217;t have done it. No one  should
    have    to do that more than once.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina wasn&#8217;t sure what to say to this. &#8220;Um, that&#8217;s O.K. I guess &#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince spoke. &#8220;If you&#8217;re sincere about your apology  to Nina; how about
completing the last fifteen minutes of Nina&#8217;s display time for her? I can
add that to the Video record of the fitting and we can file it with the contract.
Obviously I will provide your firm with a copy for your own records.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked at Nina and nodded. Placing herself back  on the dais she 
        spread her knees and placed her hands on the back of her neck. The 
 Prince       handed the remote back to Nina and spoke again, &#8220;How about 5
 minutes  at   level  one, 4 at level two, 3 at level three and so on. That
 should add up  to 15  minutes.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina pressed the start button on the timer and turned the dial to one.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah gasped as the device began its devilish work.</p>
                                          
<p>Impulsively Nina thrust the remote for Sarah&#8217;s device  into the Prince&#8217;s 
        hands. Quickly she pulled a footstool in front of Sarah  and knelt 
 it   the    display position. She spoke to the Prince, &#8220;I can&#8217;t let her do
 this   alone;    I did deserve the demerits and I knew what I was signing 
 up for.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>The Prince nodded and taking Nina&#8217;s control he turned the dial to one also.</p>
                                          
<p>With mechanical precision the devices kept Nina and  Sarah at that first
         level of arousal; vainly they attempted to increase the  stimulation
    by   writhing  gently. Gentle moans signalled the fact that the dials
had    been   turned again  and their movements gained speed. By the time
the dial   stood   at 4 both women  were helpless to prevent their hips from
grinding   lewdly   and the office was  treated to a continuous chorus of
gasping and   groaning    as the devices prevented  them from achieving release
whilst  holding them   at the knife-edge of impending  orgasm. Finally the
Prince  turned the dials   to 5 and Sarah and Nina screamed  as they were
washed helplessly into a prolonged   orgasm.</p>
                                          
<p>On the stroke of 15 minutes the Prince turned the dials slowly from 5
to 1 and finally to 0. Sarah and Nina yelped simultaneously  as small and
painful electric shocks brought them down to earth unexpectedly.  Nina was
the first to recover &#8211; this was not here first time after all &#8211; and helped
Sarah from the dais on which she was still kneeling.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Thanks. Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know. It just seemed the right thing  to do&#8230;&#8221; Nina&#8217;s voice
         trailed into silence as she became aware that she and  Sarah had
been     the    centre of everyone else&#8217;s attention. The Prince smiled  enigmatically
     and    nodded at Esme to stop filming. Nina blushed deeply as she realised
     that   her 15-minute trip to erotic oblivion was now immortalised as
digital     video.   At least she hadn&#8217;t made the journey alone this time!
The Prince     spoke, &#8220;I&#8217;ll   send you a memory stick with a copy of the
agreement and   so  forth tomorrow.   I&#8217;d keep it safe if I were you. Thanks
for the demonstration;       I look forward   to a long and productive relationship
with your firm.    Perhaps   next time  you and your team would like to visit
my country as   my honoured   guests.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Nina and Helen exchanged glances; a trip out of the  office would mean
         they would have to stay dressed whilst they worked! The  Prince
continued          with wicked smile, &#8220;Obviously the whole trip could be
deemed  to be   &#8216;at    work&#8217;  and therefore your assistants would have to
abide by your   dress-code    at all times. But that won&#8217;t be a problem,
and it would make   their  packing    for the journey a very simple affair
&#8230;&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>Helen looked to be in shock and Nina just stared at the Prince in horror.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a thought; I&#8217;ll leave the final decision up to you.&#8221;</p>
                                          
<p>With a final smile and a round of handshakes and kisses  the Prince and
         his entourage left the office with a speed that was deceptive.</p>
                                          
<p>Sarah looked speculatively at Helen and Nina and then  noticing the clock
         said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t just stand there the Prince isn&#8217;t our only  client
and    I  have    some travel arrangements to see to! Come and help me out
 of  this    Nina.&#8221;   Imperiously she swept off to her office, Nina in tow.</p>
                                          
<p>&#8220;Thursdays always were an anticlimax.&#8221; She thought ironically.<br>
