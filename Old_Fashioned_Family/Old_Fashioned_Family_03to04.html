<span style="font-weight: bold;">Old-fashioned family - Part 3

</span><br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The next morning I woke up, and took my time in
the shower. The last thing I wanted was to see any of the kids, but I was sure
at least a few of them were sleeping in my house.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I walked to the kitchen and started making
breakfast, trying my best to finish before any of the guests woke up, but I
wasn&#8217;t fast enough soon the kids appeared into the kitchen. I had a hard time,
not only due to my sore butt (which had improved somewhat overnight), but for
the shame of knowing that each one of the kids had seen me while being spanked
by my younger brother.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was sure that it would not be long until the
news were known by everyone in the village.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">With breakfast finally done I left to take a
long walk. I didn&#8217;t come back until mid-morning and by then the other kids had
left only my brothers were in the house. My dad had gone to buy groceries and I
started washing dishes while my brothers were watching cartoons on TV. It was
probably my imagination, but I could feel their eyes on me, and a few whispers.
I tried to ignore them and kept doing housework. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In the time that followed, especially over the
course of that first week, I overheard jokes about the older girl being
spanked. None of my friends said anything, much to my relief, but some
classmates asked about it and I tried to avoid explanation, so slowly the rumor
died off.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">A few months passed, and the twins had a few
more chances to put me over their lap, but not again in public, so I slowly got
used to that.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The twins were 15 years old, and to my father&#8217;s
point of view it was an important age for a boy. He saw them as old enough and
responsible enough to be considered adults.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I recalled that when our older brother turned
fifteen, things had changed. He began to take charge and was also granted the
right to discipline either me or the twins kids on his own. My dad would likely
term it a duty. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be the same for the
twins. David, after all was oldest among us, so there was some logic that he
took charge of his younger siblings while dad was away. With the twins, they
lacked the level of maturity David possessed at 15, but looking to recent
events it was hard to deny I was being put under their charge too.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">It was a Saturday, and the house had a crowd of
visitors, numering about 25. There were our aunts, cousins and family friends.
Again, there were many kids and a few of David&#8217;s friends had come as well. Dad
was handling the barbecue, and most of the kids were in the pool.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was wearing a summer dress with nylon shorts
beneath. I&#8217;d have loved to wear a bikini or my swimsuit, but I got a spanking
the night before and was still a bit sore and sensitive. I did not feel like
wearing anything too revealing.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I&#8217;d been trying to help with the guests but at
some point got time to myself. I lay on a towel with a few of my friends and we
were talking. Well, to tell the truth, I was really trying to be brave enough
to talk with Roger, a boy I had a crush on. He was nineteen years old, one of
David&#8217;s besties. He was also the brother of one of my closest friends.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was relaxing on my stomach, feeling the sun
on my back, when suddenly I felt cold water all over. I turned to see my
11-year-old cousin with a bucket on his hands.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">If I had just spent a few seconds to think and
look around, I would have seen the twins a short distance away laughing out
loud. But I just reacted without thinking , and before I knew what I was doing
slapped my cousin&#8217;s face. I ran to the bathroom, leaving my cousin crying. The
last thing I saw was some adults surrounding him.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Ok, I was in big trouble, but I was still too
mad, I locked myself into the bathroom, took off my clothes and dried myself
with a towel.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I heard my dad, sounding mad, telling me to
open the door. I wrapped myself in a big towel and unlocked the door. As soon
as I did I was dragged by the arm outside, noticing in horror as my towel fell
to the floor but unable retrieve it as I was dragged back toward the yard. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">There was no verbal scolding this time. Instead,
I was dragged over my father&#8217;s lap and his hand began to smack my butt without
mercy. I was already sore from last night&#8217;s spanking, I was scared about how
fast this was happening, and I was fully aware of being fully naked in front of
family and friends.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In no time I started crying, It wasn&#8217;t the
hardest or longer spanking I&#8217;d had, but it felt excruciating, the hand falling
and hitting my bottom while I tried to keep some dignity by covering my breasts
as best I could it that position.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I kicked and yelped like hell. Looking for a
source of support I found Roger&#8217;s face. My my humiliation made me wish die at
that moment. I then saw my friends watching my mortification. I knew they felt
sorry for me, but I also knew this was beyond their control, so I kept fighting
and crying until my dad thought I&#8217;d had enough.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then as suddenly as it had started it ended. My
father ordered me to stand, told me to go to my room, get dressed and get back
quickly.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So I did. I did my best to cover myself while
running to my room &#8211; no spanking dance this time. I was certain I&#8217;d have to
face some corner time. I thought I&#8217;d been allowed to get dressed only because
having his teenage daughter in a corner, naked, in front of a crowd would be
too much even for him.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I went to my room and slammed the door, still
crying, feeling powerless and absolutely humiliated. I again I saw again
Roger&#8217;s face and wondered what could he think of me, a girl of seventeen
spanked naked over his father&#8217;s lap. Still sniffling, I put a new pair of
panties, a bra and a clean dress.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I opened the door ready to go to the bathroom,
and found my friends outside the room. I didn&#8217;t want to see anyone, but they
didn&#8217;t gave me any option, so they helped me wipe the tear stains away and wash
my face, and spent some time trying to comfort me. They said nothing about the
spanking specifically, just offered comforting words. I then took a deep breath
and went to face everyone again. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Once in the yard I could feel everyone&#8217;s eyes. I
saw dad back at the barbecue, and slowly everyone resumed talking and doing
whatever they were doing earlier.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In time, my aunt asked me to come with her. I
followed her to the kitchen, where I found my cousin, and though it was his
fault I also felt sorry for slapping him.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">He took a while then ran and hugged me, crying
and telling me how badly he felt. I hugged him back, and believe it or not I
felt really better. His apology comforted me more than any other thing. I also
apologized for slapping him, then my aunt joined us in a hug and we all went
back to the party.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was unable to face Roger, though. I was
really sore, but It didn&#8217;t hurt half as much as the embarrassment. Though it
happened fast, there was still plenty of time for all to look at my exposed
body, and they all knew I was still spanked like a little girl. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I didn&#8217;t ask dad to let me go to my room, I
knew that he would never allow it. Once the last guest left I got the belt and
the corner time. I also had to apologize the twins for spoiling their birthday
party.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">On Sunday morning dad had to work, and he told
the twins that they were in charge of &#8220;everything&#8221; during his absence, &#8220;Sofia,
don&#8217;t cause trouble for your brothers.&#8221; His words made it clear that
&#8220;everything&#8221; included me.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">[end of Part 3]</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old-fashioned
family &#8211; Part 4

</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The new
order of things

</span><br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The first
days under the new arrangement, I discovered not being in charge was not that
bad. I mean, I still had to do all the house chores, do my homework and all the
things a teenager is supposed to do, but I didn&#8217;t have to keep an eye over the
twins so I started to spend more time in my room.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">On their
end, the twins became more bossy, trying to show who was in control. For
example, while in my room I wasn&#8217;t allowed to close the door so they could see
what I was doing. They also made sure I had done my homework and asked about my
tests.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">They
acted this way especially when they had friends over. At those times, they were
particularly annoying, reminding me of chores, clearly to show off in front of
their friends. But I didn&#8217;t mind at all, I had more time for myself, and while
I did what was expected of me I had no reason to be afraid.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I think
the first time they noticed that being in charge was not all laughs was one day
when I was in the kitchen. I&#8217;d put the dinner at the oven and went to my room. After
some minutes, I got a call from Maria, one of my friends, and I forgot about
the oven timing. By the time my dad got home the kitchen was smokey.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That day
I was spanked hard, of course, but for the first time, my father also grounded
my brothers for something I did - they were in charge, and they were not paying
attention.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My father
would never spank the boys, in his prehistoric mind that was only for girls,
but he grounded them with a no television and no friends for a week. This meant
that they would not been able to go out that Friday.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Even with
my sore bottom I felt somehow comforted. I got a lot of spankings due to their
faults, and now, they were grounded for something I did.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Obviously
, they did not feel the same way and increased their control. I was sure that
they would take advantage of any occasion to take revenge. That week I was
particularly careful, and they didn&#8217;t get a chance. The week passed without
further problems, at least until that Friday.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That
Friday I came back from school, changed myself into more comfortable clothing
and started to make an afternoon snack for the kids and myself.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I had
mine in my room when I heard the kids calling me. Waiting at the bathroom door,
they pointed inside.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia!
look at that mess, why didn&#8217;t you clean it?&#8221; said Alex. I looked inside, and
yes, It&#8217;s was all messy, really messy, but the fact is that after I took my
morning shower it was tidy. Then they used it.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;What the
&#8230; what have you done?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;It was clean this morning, it is not my fault
if you&#8217;re more pigs than boys!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I could
see water spots everywhere, toilet paper stuck to the mirror and elsewhere. It
was surely done on purpose.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">They
looked at me: &#8220;Yeah, we had a little fight in there, but It&#8217;s your
responsibility to keep the house clean, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I could barely believe it,
and stared at them seriously. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Is not
my responsibility to clean your mess, I clean the house, yes, but only for
normal use!&#8221; I was mad, but I was sure that I would be the one cleaning the
mess. &#8220;Now let me alone! I&#8217;ll clean that, and you better keep your fights out
of the house!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">They
looked at me, but finally walked away while I started cleaning. I had to spend
about one hour just to return it to its usual state. Then I walked back to my
room, and tried to relax before starting dinner. I was on my bed listening to
music when I saw the twins appear again. I took off my headphones and asked in
an aggresive manner, &#8220;What now?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Did you
finish cleaning, Sof?&#8221; Marc asked. I didn&#8217;t like when they used my short name,
but wanting them to leave me alone I nodded, &#8220;Yes, It&#8217;s clean again, so just
avoid messing it up.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Good,
then come with us, we have to deal with your punishment.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I opened
my mouth wide, unable to believe what I just heard. I felt my cheeks burning in
rage and suddenly exploded!</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;What the
hell! You&#8217;re the ones who messed up the bathroom, I cleaned it, so don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;ll let you lay a hand on me! I don&#8217;t care who&#8217;s in charge, I won&#8217;t let two
imps to lay a hand on me for something you did!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I could
see a grinning face &#8220;Are you sure Sof? You want us to tell Dad you disobeyed
us, that you neglected one of your chores and rejected your punishment?&#8221; said
Marc again. &#8220;And you insulted us; you called us imps,&#8221; added Alex.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That gave
me something to think about, I knew Dad, I knew I would get the belt for that,
but was not my intention to let them to think they were my bosses. No, better
Dad or even David, but the twins? no&#8230;.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then I
shrugged, I put my headphones back on and turned over my tummy, giving them my
back and making clear that the discussion was over. I then felt a sudden weight
over me, it took me a few seconds to realize that one boy had jumped on my
legs, the other on my back. I fought, struggling and kicking, but found that
the twins were stronger than I ever thought &#8211; they were growing teens, after
all &#8211; and since they were two I was helpless.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I felt
one of them pulling my shorts and panties down, I tried to hold them but the
other one grabbed my arms and sat on them. Then I tried to cross my legs. I
managed to avoid my clothes being pulled to my ankles, but they already had
what they wanted, my exposed bottom cheeks.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In no
time I felt the smacks on after another. I had plenty of stamina, so it wasn&#8217;t
until perhaps 40 smacks that I found myself sobbing, my tears wetting the
pillow. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The tears
did not stop them. They gave me the longest spanking I&#8217;d ever had. I slowly
stopped struggling and fighting, only trying to cover my bottom, but finding
myself unable. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">At long
last, feeling each inch of my bottom burning like hell, they stopped, released
me and left me alone in my room. I rubbed my sore bum, covered myself with
bedsheets and cried. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I heard
my dad coming back home. I didn&#8217;t knew what to expect, they had spanked me, but
knowing dad, that would not be enough for him, so I can&#8217;t say I was surprised
when I heard him coming to my room.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I&#8217;d
already put my shorts on just in case.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia,
follow me.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That time
I was allowed to explain myself, and I did. I said I wasn&#8217;t the one who made
the mess in the bathroom; I said that I cleaned it. I also explained, dying of
shame, how the twins had taken it upon themselves to spank me. Dad looked at me
and shook his head.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia,
you know is your duty to keep the house clean. If the bathroom was a mess, with
it your duty to clean it, what would have happened if I got home to see that? I&#8217;d
tell you that you would get punished, and so would your brothers since they
were in charge. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;But they
noticed before I got home, so tell me, who&#8217;s in charge when I&#8217;m not home,
Sofia?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I
mumbled, I knew it, but it was too hard to say out loud. It was hard to say
that my younger brothers were in charge. I opened my mouth, then closed it.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Who is
in charge, Sofia?&#8221; he asked again.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I knew
what was about to happen. &#8220;T..they are&#8221; I mumbled</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Who,
Sofia? I can&#8217;t hear you.&#8221; </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My face
turned red, probably as red as my buttcheeks, &#8220;They are!&#8221; I shouted.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My dad
nodded, but wasn&#8217;t still happy. &#8220;They are what? Tell us Sofia, just so we can
be sure that you understand.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I found
myself biting my lips, I could even feel the taste of my own blood, pushing my
fists hard, and finally surrendered . </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;T..they&#8217;re
in charge dad.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Good!
now that we&#8217;ve cleared the subject I want you to take the next step. I want you
to go to your room, write a note, and what I expect to find on that note is an
apology. Also I want you to write who&#8217;s in charge when i&#8217;m not home, and what
will happen next time any of your brothers thinks you need discipline.&#8220; </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then, he
took a pause to breathe.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;And what
will happen,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;Is that you will take the punishment. Then, once I
come back, if you consider the punishment unfair, you can tell me what
happened. If I think it was unfair, I&#8217;ll take care of it with them, but if I
find the punishment fair I&#8217;ll also take care of it with you, understood?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I nodded,
feeling myself against a wall, tasting salty tears mixing with my own blood.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;So, do
you understand Sofia?&#8221; he asked. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Yes
Dad,&#8221; I answered, sure that I would not find myself out of trouble so easily.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Good,
then, you won&#8217;t leave your room until you&#8217;re called. Once you&#8217;re called, you&#8217;re
expected to go to their room, read them the note, and ask them to punish you. Not
for the bathroom mess, but for ignoring them. And you&#8217;ll accept the punishment
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I nodded
again, dying in shame. I saw my dad raise an eyebrow and I knew he was
expecting a vocal anwer.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Yes
dad.. I will.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">He
nodded, and in my mind&#8217;s eye I could see my brothers grinning with a hidden
smile. &#8220;Good, and finally, before you go to sleep, I want you to go to the
bathroom, and clean it until is perfect! And you will do it bare from your
waist down, so you can remember what happens if you don&#8217;t take care of your
duties, and don&#8217;t accept your punishments.&#8221; He then gave me a few seconds to
acknowledge.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Now go! And
make sure your note is long and deep enough!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And I
went back to my room. I needed some time to comprehend what had happened. I had
to write the note, hating myself that I was doing it. I had to write how sorry
I felt for not accepting the punishment, for not being diligent with my duties.
It took me a really long time do it, since I knew what they were expecting. I
finally wrote about fifty lines of text stating that I knew they were in
charge, that I had to accept their punishments, that I knew I acted badly
today, and that I felt really sorry for that, swearing it would never happen
again.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then I
had to wait again, a long time. I heard someone ringing the doorbell, and I
thought it was a food delivery since I didn&#8217;t make dinner. I wasn&#8217;t called for
dinner, as I continued to wait.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then I
heard steps, and finally I was called, biting my lip I took my note, ready for
the last humiliation.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The door
was closed, and I had to knock. &#8220;Come in.&#8221; I opened the door and walked inside,
hearing the instruction &#8220;close the door after you.&#8221; They were sitting on one of
the twin beds. They took their time, letting me to suffer, my eyes wandering
around the room.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Undress
yourself from waist down Sofia, Marc said. This was not about curiosity, I
knew, they had had plenty of chances to watch me in the past. This was about
humiliation, about making me feel inferior, but I did as ordered. I kicked off
my slippers, then I pulled down my shorts and stood in place, covering my bush
with both hands while holding a piece of paper.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;So, I
think you have something you want to read for us?&#8221; This was Marc, and I noticed
that Alex kept quiet, letting his brother do the work.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Even
being twins there were a few differences. Alex&#8217;s grades were always better,
while Marc was best at sports. They probably had a hierarchy I&#8217;d never noticed
before. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Y.. yes
I do.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;OK, you
have all our attention.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And then
I had to read, holding the note with both hands while I was unable to cover
myself. I tried to cross my legs so at least they had not a direct view and I
started to read, trying to keep myself under control.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I started
to readiwith a steady voice, but while reading the humiliating words I&#8217;d
written my voice began to tremble, and they made me to stop a few times,
forcing me to repeat some paragraphs they could not hear, or that at least so
they claimed. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">By the
time I finished, I was shivering. I hated the whole situation, and also knew it
was about to get worse.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;That was
nice, Sof, really nice, now, I think you want to ask us something?&#8221; Marc said
with a big smile in his face.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And
again, I found myself closing my fists tight, and knowing that I didn&#8217;t had a
choice I began the next part.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Please,
could you punish me for not recognizing your authority before?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And then
again they made me wait, Alex still silent, looking at me, Marc also staring,
and me looking down to the floor with the only wish that it would swallow me.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;OK,&#8221;
Marc looked down, next to my feet, &#8220;take your slippers and hand them to us, one
for Alex and the other for me, and leave the note on my desktop.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I walked
to his desk, aware of my partial exposure, bent over and took off both
slippers, and then walked over to them handing one to each.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Now get
back to your spot, turn around, bend over as far as you can and try to hold
your ankles.&#8221; I was never spanked that way, dad had never been imaginative,
hand spankings over the knee, belt ones bending over with the stool, he never
used any other implements, nor new poses, but this was a new order.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I did as
told, finding the pose hard enough by itself, and also really exposing me. I
tried to keep my legs together, but since Marc was telling me to go further and
further down, I had to split them enough so I could reach my ankles as requested.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Marc was
standing at my back until I reached the point he wanted.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Ok Sofi,
now get ready and don&#8217;t move. If you release your ankles I&#8217;ll start again.&#8221; He
didn&#8217;t gave me time to get ready. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Before I
could even take a breath I felt the slipper smacking my buttcheek hard, first
one then the other. And then he stopped.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">As usual
I had no clue about how many swats would I get, and that didn&#8217;t help. I found
myself grabbing my ankles really tight, determined to not give them the chance
to restart for breaking position.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I faced
the second and the third round of swats, already crying and begging The belt is
the worst, but I was already sore from the recent spanking, so each of the
slipper smacks hurt my already sensitive skin enough to forget about the shame
I was feeling just seconds before.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I had to
hold for two more rounds, by that time I was a sniffling little thing. I felt
relieved when I saw Marc moving away. I didn&#8217;t move, waiting him to let me
stand up, but instead of that I noticed Alex taking his place.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;P..
please, no more, stop!&#8221; I begged through tears and snorts, but they didn&#8217;t.
Alex started to whack me, not as strongly as Marc, but enough to keep me
crying, begging and sobbing, from the first to the last .</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Finally
Alex stepped away, and then he spoke for the first time.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sof,
stand up, thank us and go clean the bathroom, let us know once you&#8217;ve finished
so we can check your work.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Without
protesting, I stood up, thanked him and felt them hugging me tight, first Alex,
them Marc. I didn&#8217;t knew if that was a way to comfort me or another type of
torture, but the hug somehow worked. I stopped crying and walked, still
exposing everything below my waist, to the bathroom where I took my time wiping
my face, cleaning my tears and trying to compose myself.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">It took
about two more hours to again clean the bathroom, the kind of cleaning I did
one time each month. I made a last check, and again knocked on their door.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;I&#8217;ve
finished,&#8221; I said without waiting for them to answer, then they walked out, and
checked my job.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Well
done Sof, now go to the kitchen, we saved some pizza for you, take it and go to
sleep, tomorrow we will have a full cleaning day.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was so
glad and tired that I didn&#8217;t even bother about my shorts. Dad was in his
office, and the twins in their room, so I had dinner, still bare from waist
down. I then washed the dishes and went to my room.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">It didn&#8217;t
take long before I was sleeping, obviously on my tummy.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>
