<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old-fashioned
family - Part 1

</span><br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And there
I was, waiting - waiting is always the worst, I hated hearing them talking,
yelling and hushing while I was in my room waiting, waiting for what? Waiting
for them, awaiting their decision, awaiting my punishment. They never asked for
my version, they did not let me explain, no, they just talked, judged and
applied the punishment. My only options were to accept it as expected, or to
make a fuss, yell, cry, tell them it was unfair. But once I finished protesting
I'd still have to take the punishment, and the extra for not accepting.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My name's
Sofia, 17 years old now, I live at home, along with my father, the younger twin
boys, Marc and Alex, they are 14 years old and then our older brother David
he's 20 years old, he goes to highschool, so is not often at home. My Mom? well
I'd prefer not to talk about her at this moment, she left us a few years ago. Well,
now that you know me, you probably wonder what I've done to be punished.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">On this
occasion I was in charge of the boys, dad was still working and David was out
with friends. We were watching TV and they suddenly began to fight, running one
after another, both crying and laughing. I tried to stop them, yelled to stop,
but they ignored me, so finally in frustration I put on my headphones and started
to listen my music. I suddenly found Marc in front of me, crying. I took off my
headphones, and could see him pointing at the other twin, on the floor, also
crying and with blood on his forehead. I ran to him and told Marc to call our
neighbour Ana, a nurse, while I tried my best to check the wound.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Once Ana
came, the situation improved. She examined my brother, and said it was nothing
serious. She put a plaster on the wound and comforted him. Then she stayed with
us until dad came back home.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">She explained
to him what happened, and assured him that it was a small wound, nothing
serious. After dad thanked her and Ana left our house, I could feel 6 eyes on
me as soon as the door closed. Dad sent me to my room, and well, as I said, the
waiting is the worst.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">After
some time Alex came for me. &#8220;Sofia, we're ready,&#8221; he said.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So I
followed him, and I saw the family. Marc, with his little plaster on his head,
dad, with his serious look and Alex, who just walked next to them, I was
standing there, in the kitchen, while they stared at me for an eternity, then
my dad started to talk.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia, I
hope you agree that we have been lucky, fortunately this was just a small
wound, but you will also agree that could be much worse. Due your lack of
attention, Marc could have been severely injured.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then he
looked at me, even knowing that there was not a question, I knew he was
expecting an answer, so I nodded silently accepting the blame and looked down.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;OK then,
bring the chair and get ready.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Silently
I walked to the chair and moved it at the center of the kitchen, then silently
pulled my pants down, along with my panties and waited in place, covering my
"shame" with both hands. I looked at dad surprised when I saw my
brother Alex, sitting on the chair instead of dad, I even thought about
arguing, but again, dad's face did not allowed any doubt, Marc got hurt for my
lack of attention, so Alex should be the one applying the punishment, no need
to ask, that was the way things worked.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My face
flushed red, half shame half hatred, just knowing that I was about to be
spanked by one of my younger brothers, I looked at him, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I saw
an smile on his face, but silently stepped to his side and put myself over his
lap, The scene could not be more ridiculous, I was taller than him, so I had to
make an effort to keep myself there.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That time
I started crying even before I felt the first smack on my bottom, from the
humiliation. Then finally he started, he had already seen dad spanking me a lot
of times so he knew how to do it, the speed, the cadence, the stops. One after
another I felt that little hand smacking each one of my cheeks, at first
without any effect, but he was young and full of energy, so what he lacked in
strength he had in endurance. It took a while, but finally I was crying and
sobbing due to pain. I even kicked, yes, even knowing that kicking and
struggling only made things worse, and my dad helped him to hold me tightly in
place.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I can&#8217;t
tell how long I was there, but when he finished I stopped crying new tears, and
was just sobbing and snorting, my butt burning like hell, burning enough to
make me forget who had spanked me.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">When they
finally released me, I started jumping and rubbing my bum, with my only wish to
get to the bathroom and apply something. Instead, dad, told me to get the
stool.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then I
started to cry, crying like a little girl, crying like a desperate girl, I
already knew the meaning of the stool, the stool meant the belt. I begged him,
I begged them all, but again dad&#8217;s face didn&#8217;t gave any options, so I wiped my
tears and walked over to get the stool, a long and short stool, placing it in
front of the chair, while I saw Marc coming back to dad with the belt.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">They
never told me how many swats I was about to get, so I knew what I had to do,
placing myself in front, one leg at each side of the stool, so my bottom was
fully exposed for the belt. I bent over, elbows on the chair seat.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I closed my
eyes and heard the belt swinging, and then the usual feeling, first the gasp,
the impression, unable to breathe for a while, and then after some seconds the
pain reaches the brain. I screamed; in time, you breathe again, grit your
teeth, close your eyes, and again, gasp, stop breathing, pain, scream, that day
I went through the stages 8 times, I did not cry, but screamed like hell. At
last, I heard the words I&#8217;d been waiting for.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia,
you may stand and apologize to your brothers, then you&#8217;ll stay in the corner
until dinner.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I stood
up, and had to apologize to my brothers, one by one. &#8220;Please, I'm sorry for
neglecting you while I was in charge, and I&#8217;m really sorry you got hurt."</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">They
smiled and nodded, and then I walked to the corner, in the living room, and
waited there, naked from the waist down, until dinnertime, well a bit before,
since I was the one who had to cook. When dad released me I walked to my room
to put on something more comfortable and went to make dinner.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">It wasn't
until after dinner and after I washed the dishes when I had time to go to the
bathroom and apply something to relieve my burning butt.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I went to
my room and and listened music until I felt asleep. The next morning I learned
that the twins were punished with no TV until Friday.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br>&nbsp;

<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old-fashioned family - Part 2

</span><br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The next morning I woke early. I could still
feeling my butt burning. As I had my shower, got dressed and made breakfast the
rest of the family started waking up.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">We all had our breakfast together, as we used
to do. I found it difficult to face Alex, but he seemed to have forgotten what
had happened, so, after having our breakfast they got ready for school while I
washed the dishes.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">We lived in a small village, we three went to
the same school, while our older brother attended a nearby college. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The twins, and myself walked to the school. On
the way, we usually run into some friends, and this morning was no exception. In
the end, we were ten or twelve walking together to school.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was doing my best to hide the fact that with
each step my butt rubbed my panties, causing me a reminder of yesterday's
spanking. I was used to get my butt warmed, but it didn&#8217;t made it easier.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In our village spankings were not out of the
ordinary, but while my friends had stopped getting them a couple of years ago I
was still spanked often. I was sure some were aware of that, and I also knew
some of them would notice my bad mood and clumsy walk, but again they avoided comment.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The rest of the week passed without problem. The
kids behaved every day after school, and after a couple of days i was able to
sit without difficulty.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Fridays were a special day at our village. Being
a small place with everyone knowing each other, families would send kids to
neighbors' houses. Sometimes they'd sleep over and the families took turns to
care for them. On the average, we had lots of visiting kids at our house one
time each month and a half - and that was trouble. But we had 5 more Fridays
without the twins, so I considered that a good deal, since these were the only
days I was able to spend time alone at home.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">A couple of weeks later, on a Friday, a group
was walking home made up of a dozen or so kids, and 2 of my friends.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My friends were not planning to stay too long
at my house, but would help me manage the kids for a couple of hours.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My friends were helping me with the snacks as
some of the kids played in the yard and some inside. I was doing the best job I
could, supervising as I moved in and out of the house and serving drinks and
snacks.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">On one of my trips to the yard I saw the boys
there starting a dare game. Marc was the proposing it, and the kids began to
make dares. I went inside again for more drinks, and when I went back outside I
could see my brother Marc, with a stone on his hand while another kid was
standing in front of him. I could recognize the scene, they&#8217;d recently seen the
film Braveheart, and they wanted to recreate one the the scenes, the one where
they throw stones at another.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I shouted at them to stop, and I knew they
heard because they turned toward to me. But Marc, instead of stopping, threw a
stone. My heart skipped a beat; I could view the scene as if in slow motion as
the stone missed the other boy my a hair.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In a rage, without thinking about it, I walked
over to my brother, grabbed him by his arm and swatted his butt with all my
strengh and anger.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The rest of the boys became silent while Marc
began to cry and ran in to his room. My friends had heard me shout and arived
on the scene. They told me that I did right, it was a dangerous game, and since
the kids had ignored me while I was in charge the swats were the right thing to
do. I felt better.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Later I tried to talk with my brother, but he
yelled at me, so I left to take care of the other boys.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Later, once my dad arrived home, I thanked my
friends for helping and they left.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">After a time my dad asked me where Marc was. I
explained what happened, I could see in his eyes he was not happy, but he left
without a word and went to talk with him.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">All the kids were now watching a movie, we had
already ordered pizza from a nearby restaurant. I walked into the kitchen to do
some cleaning before dinnertime.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In a while, my dad and Marc walked into the
kitchen. I didn&#8217;t know what was to happen, but just seeing my brother&#8217;s face,
with something like an evil smile , was sufficient to know I was in trouble.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Alex was with them, too, but as they'd not said
anything I kept washing dishes. Finally my dad began: </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia, come here, and repeat for me what
happened before.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I stopped washing, my legs trembled a little,
but I managed to wipe my hands and walk over in front of them. I explained for
a second time what happened. I could feel their gaze judging me as I talked,
and by the time I&#8217;d finished some of the other kids had walked into the
kitchen.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">My dad was always serious, his idea of humor
was a few chauvinist jokes he knew, but he had a special face for these
situations, his eyes staring into mine and I'd feel I was being judged. I
started explaning with a strong voice, but as I went on I lowered it, began to
tremble alittle, and ended with mumbling that was sounding like nonsense.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">As I finished, I had to wait, feeling all eyes
on me, and even worse, feeling dad&#8217;s eyes.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;So, you spanked Marc in front of his friends? Did
I ever spank you in front of yours?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I shivered again, shook my head and tried to
make excuses.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;I.. It was not a spanking, I mean, I just gave
him a few swats, I.. I didn&#8217;t think that would be a problem, I mean, I told
them to stop, and that was dangerous.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Again the waiting with my sense of time passing
different from everyone else assembled. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Sofia, bring the chair here, and get ready to
be spanked.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I looked at him, and then at the crowd, I
blushed just at the thought, and deeply hoped for an earthquake or anything
else that would stop the madness. I felt tears falling from my eyes; I had
learned not to argue with dad&#8217;s decisions, but that time I could not avoid it.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;B..but&#8230; that&#8217;s not fair&#8230;. what I was supposed
to do? Please, can&#8217;t you let it go until tomorrow, or.. do it privately?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was
there, arguing and begging, my voice already trembling, feeling the tears while
looking around for any help, and I heard my dad raise his voice.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Enough! You&#8217;ve already deserved a hand
spanking, and the belt, not it&#8217;s your choice to accept it or not, If you don&#8217;t
you&#8217;ll make things even worse. You, little lady, humiliated your brother in
front of his friends, you spanked him without any right to do it, so now,
you&#8217;ll get the same treatment! And if you don&#8217;t bring the chair and the stool
here right now, and I can see your bare bottom before I have time for a second
thought, I can tell you that you won&#8217;t be bare only from the waist down.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I knew him very well, and if something was true
about him it was that he always kept his word. I bit my lip and silently got
for the chair, placing it at the center of the kitchen, then moved back to
fetch the hated long stool. The silence on the room spoke volumes. I did my
best to avoid everyone's eyes, wiping my tears one after another, knowing what
was about to happen.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I thought to again try to explain that I gave
my brother only a few swats over his clothing, that I found what was about to
happen totally unfair, but I didn&#8217;t say a word as I knew if I talked again, I
would have to face a public spanking without any clothes. </span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So I positioned the chair and the stool, put
myself in the middle, and closeing my eyes took off my shoes and silently
pulled down my shorts and panties in front of my family and the crowd of kids. Even
with my eyes closed I could feel their gaze, and I covered myself the best I
could.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">When I finally opened my eyes I saw Marc
sitting on the chair, and I knew that I was again to be spanked by one of my
little brothers. I should have known that each time some new way to punish
occurred, it was repeated often, and usually became a tradition.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">That time I promised myself to not cry, silly
thing, I always cried, and I&#8217;d already cried a few minutes ago, but that was
for indignation. I put myself over my brother&#8217;s lap, and felt my dad hold me
tight again. I clenched my teeth, and tried to ignore the kids gathered round. They
had come closer, placing themselves in a circle around me, ready for the show.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I felt the first swats, and thought he was
teasing me, I was sure he was enjoying spanking his big sister in front of his
friends. He would become a hero with his firends, and he took his time, first
light, fast swats, then slowly each one harder than the last, one cheek, then
the other.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I kept my eyes closed, my teeth clenched
tightly, feeling my butt getting warmed. Then Marc stopped, and then spanks
again began to fall, harder this time, slowly, giving me time to feel the full
effect of each before the next. I tried to struggle, and felt my dad&#8217;s hands
holding me tight as my nose beagn to run. Then, as I started to sob, my brother
suddenly stopped.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I thought he had finished, but then he spanked
me further. This time I could tell he put all his spirit on each one of his
swats, and I whined and cried, quietly at first, but soon began to do so loudly
as any pride I'd held onto was gone. I wiggled, kicked, creid, and whined in
the crowded but at same time silent kitchen, hearing the repetitive sound of
the smacks over my burning cheeks.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I tried to look at dad, begging him to stop it,
but he ignored me. By the time Marc had stopped I was feeling small and
helpless, a sobbing and snorting girl over his lap.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Ok Sofia, I think that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said Marc.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And I could only mumble a sincere &#8220;thank you,&#8221;
really relieved, while I felt my dad release me, and I did my silly dance in
front of a bunch of kids. I was not worried about being naked from waist down,
at that time all I could think of was my butt. I knew that the worst part was
still to come, the belt, but I was in too much pain to clearly focus on what
was ahead.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I was given time to recover, and then was told
to apologize, first to Marc, for smacking him in public, then, to shame me
further, to the kids, for making them to watch such a pitiful show.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And I apologized, again conscious of my exposed
situation, and tried to cover my intimate area the best I could. I apologized
to my little brother - still sitting with a wide smile on his face - for
humiliating him in front of his friends. Then I faced his friends, a whole
bunch of kids, who had just watched me cry, beg, and do a dance of shame.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I apologized to them for the show they&#8217;d
watched. I did this even knowing they had no problem with what they'd
witnessed.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Then my dad sent me to the corner, and made me
to wait there. Once he was back with the pizzas I&#8217;d get the belt, or not,
depending on my attitude while he was out.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So, I had to wait again, exposing my burning
butt to anyone who wanted to look. Slowly the silence moved to whispers, and
then laughs while I stood there, wishing it were over.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I even had to stand still while I felt one hand
on my exposed butt. I wanted to send them to Hell, but I was too scared of the
belt, so I kept silent and still, feeling that hand, then another one, and
another. Fortunately they soon satisfied their curiosity and left me in the
corner, though a few came back to have a last look at an older teen&#8217;s bottom
sore and exposed.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Finally dad came back, and after asking my
brothers how I had been I was allowed to put my clothes back on. I did it
feeling my cotton panties hurting my sore and damaged skin.</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="" lang="EN-GB">We had dinner together, and finally, after
washing the dishes my dad allowed me to go to my room. I closed the door and
cried again, in shame and in pain, then again put on my headphones to stop
hearing the kids downstairs. Exhausted emotionally and physically, I soon fell
asleep.</span>
