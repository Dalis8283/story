<p><br> <br> CHILD PROTECTIVE COURT by Mike Wilks <br> &nbsp; <br> CHAPTER I <br> &nbsp; <br>
The following is a true, factual and accurate account of what is
happening to me and my family at the hands of the Canadian Child
Protective Court. I have changed the names of some of those involved to
protect them and to prevent any type of legal ramification or
retaliation. I am choosing to publish this account in this forum,
because despite the fact that this letter is factual, it contains
descriptions of sexual conduct and forced nudity, all of which was and
is non-consensual; therefore, no other forum or news organization would
allow me to report this. <br> &nbsp; <br> It all started about eight
months ago. I was finalizing my divorce, dating my new
girlfriend/fiancé and working hard as a sales representative. I had
already lost my house and was going to share custody of my children,
but it was worth it to end the relationship with that woman I had
somehow married. My fiancé was willing to take on her role as part time
step-mother to my twelve year old son and fourteen year old daughter
and deal with any issues surrounding visitation and custody that may
arise with my ex-wife. In return I was willing to be full time
step-father to her two daughters, aged ten and sixteen. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Forgive me, my name is Mike Wilks. My ex-wife’s name is “Bitch,” sorry,
no her name is Rebecca Wilks. My fiancé/wife’s name is Dawn Wilks, we
have were married during, despite, because of, forced to, etc. etc.
this entire ordeal. Anyway it’s a long story. I’ll try not to make it
too long, but give as much detail as possible. Probably too much
detail. Hopefully this forum will allow me to get my message out.
Without the details, the portrayal of the incident would amount to
nothing. <br> &nbsp; <br> Let me introduce my children. My son’s name
is Branden and his sister, my natural daughter’s name is Brianna. My
step-daughters are Kimberly and Riley ******. Kim is ten and Riley is
sixteen. Brandon and Kimberly attend ******* Elementary School. Brianna
attends ******* Junior High School. Riley attends ****** High School.
They are all well behaved normal kids. I had no issues with any of
them. <br> &nbsp; <br> Branden and Brianna were adjusting to weekends
with me and weekdays with Rebecca. Kim and Riley were starting to
accept me as their step-father, but were never affectionate. Their lack
of affection was just fine with me. They were respectful toward me and
Dawn and were good girls. They were involved in afterschool activities
and functions, until the COVID 19 shut down finally closed everything.
The girls were good, well mannered, no drugs, good grades, really no
problems at all. Things were going fine. <br> &nbsp; <br> I was living
with Dawn and we talked about maybe getting married, but I was not
ready so soon after the divorce. Rebecca was living in my house with
some guy and then another. She would not commit to any relationship. I
know the only reason she would not commit was because she wanted
continued support from me, which would end if she got married. She was
working as a part time receptionist. With her job, spousal support, and
child support she was making ends meet. My job was going well in sales.
I was making enough to support both households, but just barely.
Paycheck to paycheck. <br> &nbsp; <br> All the way across the globe,
in Asia/China/Europe or wherever, an illness was reported. That illness
was reported and reported. I did not pay any attention. SARS, bird flu,
H1N1, etc. it did not concern me and I had to focus on my job. I was
working forty-five hours a week, at least. I sold sports equipment to
everyone: Medical facilities, schools, professional sports, and
leagues. I was doing fine. Sorry to repeat, but things were ok. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Well, Rebecca had her hours cut. I really think that is what started
it, but maybe it was resentment over my happiness with Dawn. I can
never be sure. But her attitude changed. We argued before and had
disagreements even over petty stuff, that is why we ended the
relationship, but it was getting worse. She asked for more money. I
agreed. She needed it and really she only asked for an extra fifty
dollars a week. It was reasonable. <br> &nbsp; <br> November is
usually a slow month for me, along with December. Holiday money is not
spent on sporting equipment. I can’t complain, there have to be lean
months. Something was different this year. Sales were really slowing
down. I get paid salary plus commission, so I can survive with slightly
lower sales and I save during fat months to cover the lean months;
however, this year I was supporting more. <br> &nbsp; <br> I told
Rebecca that not only would I have stop paying the extra fifty dollars
a week, I would have to contact the court to lower the support amounts.
She freaked out. She cussed me out over the phone and said that I was
worthless and that now there was no real use for me. She said that she
was going to find a real man, but that he might not want to deal with
custody issues. She was raving. I don’t even remember all of the
horrible things she said. It was terrible. I was worried she would get
an attorney and fight me on the support. What she did was far worse. <br> &nbsp; <br>
The Child Protective Court - Social Services did not even bother to
contact me. When they got the complaint, they went directly to the
schools. They must have been very slow at work or they have a lot of
social workers. They sent two social workers to each school to
“interview” my children. I put interview in quotes, because an
interview is a conversation. What they did was not a conversation. It
was disgusting abuse that was totally unjustified. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Before you even go there. Before you even say it. I heard it all
before. “You were not there.” “How do you know what happened?” “Have
you considered the kids may exaggerate?” Well I tell you I KNOW what
happened! I saw what they did to the kids in front of me. I will
describe all of that later. I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but
this is so frustrating putting this down on paper. I talked to the
kids, the school staff, those who would talk to me, and others who
witnessed, and what I saw them do later. I also read the reports. These
social worker perverts have no shame or fear of anything. They fucking
documented what they did, or at least most of it. <br> &nbsp; <br>
They did what I am saying they did. It took me a while to piece it
together, but this is what happened. At least what I know of what
happened, it would not surprise me if there was more vile conduct that
was left out of the information I was provided. I know some will be
skeptical, but I have no reason to lie. This is how social workers
investigate abuse claims. <br> &nbsp; <br> Rebecca contacted the
Canadian Child Protective Court and reported that I had been
inappropriate and abusive to children in my house. I read the
complaint. That is ALL she alleged. She said I was inappropriate. What
does that even mean? She also said that I had been abusive. She did not
elaborate. She never said whether I was verbally abusive, emotionally
abusive, physically abusive, or sexually abusive. I read her complaint.
That is so fucking vague. How can they even act on that. They did. They
certainly did. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Two social workers went to the elementary school to interview Brandon
and Kim. They walked in to the administration building and spoke to the
receptionist. They identified themselves as Mr. Clark and Ms. Doyle.
They had the complaint letter and some official looking identification.
They contacted the Vice Principal, Mrs. Allison, and requested, more
like demanded, that she have Brandon and Kim brought to the office.
They told V.P Allison that they needed to use an office to interview
Brandon and Kim. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon and Kim arrived at the
office, confused. V.P Allison introduced Mr. Clark and Ms. Doyle. You
know, for ease of writing. After I mention or introduce someone, I will
just use their last name, except for my kids. I’ll use my kids first
names. I hope this is not too confusing. If a last name is repeated,
like with the two Ms. Rodriguez’, I’ll talk about them later, I will
use first name and last initial. You should know who I am talking
about. Sorry again, this is so stressful. <br> &nbsp; <br> I met all
of the social workers at a later date. Actually at the first hearing,
but I did meet them. So I do know what they look like, mannerisms, etc.
So when I describe them, it is based on firsthand knowledge. Clark is a
white male 5’5” 235 pounds and about forty-eight, I’ll just use numbers
48, years old. He is a total pervert, well that is an opinion, but you
decide. Well ALL of the Child Protective Court, Social Services, and
all involved in my ordeal are PERVERTS. There I said it. Doyle is a
white female 5’1” 180 pounds about 50 years old, feminist lesbian. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Allison introduced Clark and Doyle to Branden and Kim as social workers
and told them they needed to interview them. Allison led them to the
counselor’s office. The counselor’s office was two doors down from
Allison’s office. The office had a large window in the door, but was
otherwise private. <br> &nbsp; <br> Before I go on, I want you all to
know that I did not find out about these interviews until two weeks
later, at the hearing. If the schools had contacted me when the social
workers arrived at the schools, I would have left work and gone
straight there and put a stop to it. I would have used whatever force
necessary and stopped it. I am so upset with the schools for not
contacting me, but at the same time I am grateful that they ultimately
at least told me what happened. So I know my kids were telling me the
truth and so I would know what asshole perverts the social services
department are. <br> &nbsp; <br> Alright here are the details as
described to me by my kids, the school receptionist, and the reports
from social services. Clark and Doyle introduced themselves again to
Brandon and Kim. They said that they had received a report that they
had been abused or mistreated in some way. No other details, just that.
They both then took turns asking each of them questions about what it
was like when they spent time with me. First basic questions. Was there
dad, me, nice to them? Did I yell at them? Did we do activities
together? Did I feed them? They went on for about 10 min asking basic
normal child welfare questions. Brandon and Kim both said that they
like me and that me and her mom, Dawn, were very nice. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Then after 10 min, Doyle asked whether they were ever bad or broke
rules. Both said that sometimes they are noisy or run in the house.
They acknowledged really minor misbehavior. She asked if they ever tell
lies. Both denied lying. She told them that they both need to be
completely honest. Both agreed to only tell the truth. Clark asked both
of them what type of punishment they get if they are noisy or run in
the house. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Usually Brandon and Kim are perfect. I don’t worry about running,
unless it is really unsafe, like with scissors. I also don’t care about
normal noise, unless they are screaming or fighting, which they don’t.
So I can honestly say that I have never really punished any of my kids,
other than a scolding, just a stern look and rule reminder. I have
never hit any of my kids. And, just for the record but I will likely
repeat numerous times, I have NEVER had any sexual contact with any
child let alone my children or step-children. <br> &nbsp; <br> Both
told them that I have never punished them. Clark and Doyle again
reminded them to be truthful. They got scared, like they were accusing
them of lying, but repeated that I had never punished them. They told
them that they would verify that later with an exam. Then Doyle asked
Brandon if I, these are not quotes she likely said either my first name
Mike or your father, have ever touched him inappropriately. Like he was
supposed to understand that. She clarified and asked if I had ever
touched the area of his body covered by a swim suit. He said no. She
then asked Kim the same question. She said no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark
then asked Brandon if I give him hugs or handshakes. I do hug my kids.
There is nothing wrong with that. I don’t really hug my step-children,
but I do hug Brandon and Brianna. Kim and Riley don’t mind that I don’t
give them hugs. They do not like hugs and are really reserved and shy.
Kim is only 10 and I had never seen her completely naked. Dawn would
take her to medical appointments and assist in bathing if necessary, so
there was no occasion for that to happen. <br> &nbsp; <br> I certainly
never saw Riley naked. She would lock her bedroom door and the
bathroom. Even Dawn had probably not seen Riley naked since she turned
12 or 13. Riley is very shy, more than normal. Kim will wear a two
piece bathing suit, but not Riley. She wears only one piece, and
usually shorts and a T-shirt, unless she is going into the water
directly. <br> &nbsp; <br> I also will give cheek kisses to Brandon,
Brianna, and Kim. Brianna and Kim like cheek kisses. Dawn gives them
also to Brandon, Brianna, and Kim. Brandon prefers hugs from me but
sometimes leans in his cheek for a kiss. But he likes cheek kisses from
Dawn. Riley does not like cheek kisses from anyone. She is so cute and
adorable, in a platonic way not a perverted way, that she should want
to get hugs and kisses. But she is too shy or too stuck up, not really
sure. In any event, we just let her be and don’t push the affection
issue. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon told them that I give hugs and cheek
kisses. They looked at each other as if he said something wrong. Doyle
then asked Kim. She told them that she gets hugs and cheek kisses from
me and her mom. Clark then told Brandon to demonstrate how dad hugs
with him. He had Brandon stand up and he stood up. Brandon then gave
him a hug like he does with me. Doyle asked Kim, is that the way dad
hugs? Kim said yes. Clark then told Brandon to demonstrate the cheek
kiss. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon asked how he can do that. He said he
just sticks out his cheek and dad kisses it. So Clark said alright,
stick out your cheek. Clark then gave him a quick peck on the cheek. He
asked if that was how I do it. Brandon said, yes. Kim also shook her
head up and down, yes. Clark asked whether dad ever kisses him on the
mouth, like for goodnight or if I am dropping him off at moms. He said
no. That is true, I never have ever kissed any of the children on the
lips. Doyle then asked if mom has ever kissed him on the lips. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
I am not sure whether Brandon was thinking about Rebecca or Dawn,
because he refers to both of them as mom. Brandon is a smart 12 year
old, but I don’t think that Doyle was clear in her question. It was
easy with the questions about me, they only have one dad. Dawn’s
ex-husband is deceased. So even her girls only have one father figure. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brandon said yes. Mom has kissed him on the lips. Doyle told Brandon to
demonstrate. He got nervous and shaky, but was like how? Just like
before, just demonstrate the kiss. He stood up and moved toward Doyle,
but she stayed seated. No not on me, demonstrate on Clark. Brandon
froze, but Clark asked him whether he had been abused by kissing or
what the issue was. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon said that he did not want
to kiss a man. Clark told him that it is not a real kiss, not real
affection, it is just a demonstration for an interview. Also that if he
did not do it or refused any other part of the interview or exam, he
would be removed from my home and sent to a juvenile facility. I am so
upset that the Child Protective Court uses so many threats to conduct
investigation. All of us were threatened and it just upsets me every
time. I will try to remain focused as I continue. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brandon agreed and leaned in for a quick peck on Clark’s lips. Clark
acknowledged the kiss. Doyle asked if that was the same as his mother
kissed him. Brandon said yes. Kim just looked straight. Doyle asked her
if that was how mom had kissed Brandon. She said she did not know, she
did not ever see that. Clark asked if dad had ever kissed him like
that. He was trying to trick him, he had already answered that. He
said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Kim was asked if dad had ever kissed her on
the mouth or lips. She said no. I am glad that either her real father
never kissed her on the lips or she understood the question. Because if
he had, it would have caused more problems, just because of a
misunderstanding. Doyle then asked Kim if mom had ever kissed her on
the lips. She said, yes. Doyle asked her to demonstrate. She said ok,
but only one kiss. Kim got up and walked toward Clark. Doyle told her,
no not with him, show me. Kim’s eyes got big, but she heard what Clark
had told Brandon. So she went over and gave Doyle a quick kiss on her
lips. <br> &nbsp; <br> The receptionist saw both kisses and contacted
Allison. Allison knocked on the door and asked what they were doing.
Clark said that it was official Social Services business and that she
could be in trouble if she impedes the investigation. Allison was
strong and asked why they needed to kiss the children. Doyle said that
it is to clear up any misunderstanding and ensure that the Child
Protective Court is certain that the children understand the terms used
and demonstrate normal conduct. Allison shrugged and said that it was
alright, but that all of the office staff can see them and to please
consider the children’s feelings. Doyle chimed in and said that all of
the investigation is to protect and help the children and for Allison
to leave or that she watch them from her office. She said they have
nothing to hide. <br> &nbsp; <br> Doyle told Brandon and Kim that they
were almost finished but there were more questions that needed to be
resolved. Doyle said that they needed to find out what conduct lead to
the complaint. So there was more to do. <br> &nbsp; <br> That was
total crap. They just assumed the complaint was real and needed to find
out why it was real. It never occurred to them that the complaint was
fake, that it was so vague, or that it was a pissed off ex-wife trying
to extort or retaliate. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> They told Brandon
and Kim that they would need to examine them to make sure they had no
cuts, bruises, tattoos (yes tattoos), or any sexual injury. They told
Kim to wait outside of the room. Kim stepped out and stood by the door.
The receptionist saw her and brought her a chair. As Kim was sitting
down she saw that Brandon started taking off his clothes and looked
like he was going to cry. <br> &nbsp; <br> In the room, Clark and
Doyle told Brandon that he needed to take off his clothes, but told him
that he could leave his underwear on. They told him that was why his
sister left the room. They told him that he needed to cooperate or his
father would go to prison for a long time. It was when they threatened
to lock me up that Brandon cooperated. He took of his shoes and socks.
Clark took them and looked at them, like he was searching them. Brandon
took off his shirt and handed it to Clark. Clark took it and told
Brandon to keep going. Brandon took off his pants. Clark took them and
went through the pockets. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon was in his
underwear standing and he could see the receptionist, she had gone back
to her desk, but was facing the office door. He could also see his
sister, step-sister, Kim looking through the door. He gave her a look,
like please turn around. She did. Clark took out a cloth tape measure
and began taking measurements. Brandon asked why. Clark said that,
since he did not see any bruises or injuries, they take measurements,
just to verify the exam. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark measured Brandon’s
chest, neck, upper arms, and upper thighs. Doyle wrote down the
measurements as he called them out. Brandon was nervous and
embarrassed, but at least he had on his underwear. <br> &nbsp; <br> At
that point, Doyle’s phone rang. I could never prove it, but I am sure
it was all part of a plan from the beginning. She answered it and began
talking. She seemed all upset and concerned. Brandon could not hear the
other person on the phone. But he did hear her say to the other person,
“so Brianna told the whole story?” Doyle then kept nodding and looking
at Brandon. She then said that Brandon and Kim had told her that
nothing had happened. She thanked the caller and said that “it was good
to have the truth now.” <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark asked Doyle what she
had been told. Doyle told him that the social workers at Brianna’s
school had interviewed her and that she had told the whole truth. That
they needed to make sure that Brandon and Kim were not covering up
anything or lying. They would need to do more questions and do a
genital check. <br> &nbsp; <br> That was total crap. They just said
that Brianna was being interviewed, which was true, and that she had
told the whole story and the truth, which was true, BUT they led
Brandon to believe that Brianna had accused me of doing something bad
like abuse. However, to cover themselves so nobody could accuse them of
lying, they never actually told a lie. They never told Brandon or Kim
what Brianna had said. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark told Brandon that
because of the new information, they need to cover an additional
section in the interview handbook. He also told him that he would have
to remove his underwear. Brandon told them that they had promised that
he would not be naked. They said that the phone call and Brianna’s
information changed that. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Trust me, at the hearing, I tried to claim that that was a lie. They
never received information from Brianna that changed anything. That was
just a trick to see if Brandon or Kim would change their story. So they
really did lie to Brandon when they told him that they did not need him
to be completely naked. And having him do the additional demonstrations
and questions was all part of their initial intentions at the start of
the interview. But at the hearing the judge ruled that interview
strategy is discretionary and that the ruse was lawful and an
acceptable practice in the social work industry. But the judge did say
that it was a trick and that it should be used sparingly. Like that is
a real admonishment, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon took off his
underwear and gave them to Clark. He turned red and attempted to cover
his penis and balls with his hands. Kim had looked in again and saw
that Brandon was naked. Her only thought was that she would likely be
next and have to be naked now, not just her underwear. Clark told
Brandon to place his hands on his head or behind his back, which ever
was more comfortable, but that his penis needed to be examined. Brandon
put his hands on his head and looked straight ahead out the door
window. <br> &nbsp; <br> Because of the location of the office, the
only person who could really see into the office door window was the
receptionist or anyone at her desk. But, at this time of day, the
office was slow and it was only Allison and the receptionist in that
area of the administration building. The receptionist looked over and
could see that Brandon was fully naked. <br> &nbsp; <br> The
receptionist could see that his hands were on his head and his
underwear were off and she could see his genitals. Brandon has an
average size circumcised penis and testicles with just the beginnings
of pubic hair. She could clearly see his penis. She got up and went to
Allison’s office to report it. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison came out of
her office again and confirmed that Brandon was nude. She walked over
to the door and knocked. Clark opened the door and Allison asked them
both what they hell was going on. They told her that the investigation
was continuing and that their sister was being interviewed and provided
information that led them to have to perform phase two of the social
services interview with abuse victims. Brandon was glad that Allison
was on his side, but now he was standing naked with his hands on his
head, with the door open in full view of the receptionist and the V.P. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Allison knew Brianna, so when they said that they were interviewing
Brianna, she knew that they were doing a serious investigation. Allison
is a public servant and did not want to be labeled as interfering with
an investigation into child abuse. She told them that she would verify
that social workers were at Brianna’s school ****** Junior High School.
She closed the door to the office. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison went to
the receptionists desk and called Brianna’s school. She continued to
observe as Brandon stood naked and answered questions from both Clark
and Doyle. She also saw Clark bend down in front of Brandon a few
times, but could not see what he was doing, because his head was
obstructing the view. Allison was able to talk to Mrs. Nichols the V.P.
at ******* Junior High School. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols answered the
phone at the receptionist desk at the school. Nichols told Allison that
two social workers were at that very moment in Nichols’ office
conducting an interview and exam of Brianna. That was why she was at
the reception desk. She told her that Brianna was completely naked and
the two women were questioning her and examining her. Nichols told
Allison that something bad must have happened to Brianna, because she
was crying and the women were having her demonstrate what the person
who hurt her had done. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols told Allison that she
was not surprised that Allison had called her, because Ms. De Walt from
******* High School had called her immediately when two social workers
arrived to interview Riley. Nichols had not heard anything else from De
Walt so she had no information about how the interview with Riley was
going. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison could see that Brandon was turned
around and bent over and being examined by Clark with Doyle watching
and taking notes. She told Nichols that Brandon and Kim were being
interviewed and she would let her know what she can later. Nichols told
Allison the same thing, that she would contact Allison when they finish
with Brianna, if she gets any information. Nichols said that if De Walt
called again she would let De Walt know about Brandon and Kim. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Allison was terrified of the Child Protective Court. She respects them
and knows that most of the basic principles that they stand for are
good. Some agency needs to investigate child abuse. However, she has
seen that the system can be abused. People can file false reports and
the system is very slow to clear them. The Court, with the Social
Services workers, has broad powers over the schools and parents.
Allison was both a parent and a school administrator, so she had to
tread lightly. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison told me that she wanted to
stop the interview when she saw Brandon naked, that is why she
contacted the middle school to verify the investigation. She had never
seen Clark or Doyle before, so she just wanted to make double sure they
were legit. They were. She also wanted to stop the investigation before
any physical genital exam and when saw Brandon in his underwear, she
thought the investigation was going to just be cursory and not genital.
Then she saw that it was a full investigation and would include genital
exam and demonstration. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison was a trained
mandated child abuse reporter, so she has received training in how
Social Services does exams. But almost all exams and interviews that
she had seen over the years at the school, did not involve genitals.
However, more and more she was seeing that the exams are full blown
investigations. She told me that it seemed odd to her that the social
workers conduct the genital exams and demonstrations and not medical
doctors and that the social workers involved in full investigations
always seemed, well she tried to be polite and professional, like they
enjoyed their jobs and, well, homosexual. I said it, because she said
it. They seemed like they were homosexual. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison
went back to the office after hanging up with Nichols. She opened the
door and saw that Clark had his finger inserted into Brandon’s anus.
She maintained her composure and simply told them that she had
contacted Nichols at ******** Junior High and confirmed the
investigation. <br> &nbsp; <br> Doyle looked at Allison and smiled and
said that that was very good. Doyle told Allison that the verification
was certainly justified. She smiled again and told her that her pendant
looked beautiful. Brandon was bent over and facing away the entire
time, Clark was cupping his penis and balls and looking at his anus
with a small pen light that he held in his mouth. He still had his
finger in Brandon’s anus. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Doyle asked Allison to let her see her pendant. Allison went deeper
into the office and up to Doyle and leaned over as Doyle sat. The
pendant hung down and Doyle reached for it and looked at it. Allison
told me that she was then given a clear message by Doyle. Doyle spoke
to Allison but looked at her cleavage and her face up close. Doyle told
her that the pendant was very nice, but Allison knew she was talking
about her boobs, and that if Allison interrupts the interview with Kim,
Allison will be cited for obstructing an investigation and could be
required to do community service at the therapy clinic. I did not know
what that meant at the time that Allison told me that, but I do now. I
will talk about it later. <br> &nbsp; <br> Allison smiled a fake but
beautiful smile and Doyle and laughed. Doyle said is helping out at the
clinic funny. Allison got serious and said of course not, I just
promise that there will be no further interruptions and that I will
inform the receptionist not to interrupt either. Doyle released the
pendant and allowed Allison to return to her office. Allison left the
admin building. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon told me that when he removed
his underwear, after Allison left, the first time, Clark had him naked
with his hands on his head. Clark asked him whether his dad, I, had
ever punished him by making him stand naked. Brandon said, no. He asked
Brandon whether I had ever handled his penis or balls. Brandon said,
no. Clark reached for Brandon’s penis and began to physically examine
it. Brandon objected and was going to bring his hands down. Clark told
him that if the hands come down he will be arrested and so would his
father. Brandon stood still. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark asked Brandon if I
had ever required him to become erect. He said, no. Clark asked Brandon
if I had ever put my lips or tongue on his penis or balls. He said, no.
Clark then demonstrated. He opened his mouth and put Brandon’s penis
and balls in his mouth. He held them in his mouth for about 15 seconds
and then opened and let them out. He then had Brandon confirm that I
had never done anything like that to him. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark had
Brandon turn around. He cupped Brandon’s penis and balls with his hand
and asked if I had ever put anything like my penis or finger in his
rear end, ass, anus. Brandon said, no. Clark stuck the tip of his
finger into Brandon’s anus and left it. He then asked if his dad had
ever done anything like this. Brandon said, no. While Clark’s finger
was in Brandon’s anus, Allison came in. As she opened the door he heard
Doyle say, you’ll like this. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon could not see,
but he heard Allison say that she contacted Brianna’s school and
confirmed the investigation. Brandon thought that Allison confirmed
that Brianna had told that she had been abused, but he was not really
sure if he remembered what she said correctly. Doyle then told her to
come close to look at her necklace or pendant. Doyle told Allison not
to interrupt again. Allison agreed. Doyle said something about a clinic
and about Allison being in trouble if she obstructed. Allison left. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Doyle referred to the checklist and said last thing on the list is
kissing. Brandon told me they had covered that in the beginning. Clark
told Brandon to turn around and put his hands behind his back. Brandon
was standing there naked and Clark asked him whether his dad ever
kissed him with his tongue. Brandon said, why do you keep asking the
same question. Clark said, no, I asked if he ever kissed you on the
mouth or lips, I never asked about tongue. Brandon said, whatever, and
told him, no. Clark told him to open his mouth. Brandon did. Clark told
him to stick out his tongue, like he was going to look at it like a
doctor. Brandon stuck out his tongue. Clark then opened his mouth and
started to suck on Brandon’s tongue. <br> &nbsp; <br> Clark kept, well
basically French kissing Brandon, for like 15 seconds. Clark then put
his hand on Brandon’s penis. Brandon told me that he was scared,
disgusted, and not at all into guys. But it just happened as Clark was
kissing him and playing with his penis, Brandon got hard. As soon as
Brandon got hard, Clark stopped kissing him. He stepped back and told
Doyle. Look at his penis. That penis is erect. This does not appear to
be the first time he has been kissed and fondled by an adult male. That
is enough evidence and information for now. Clark told her that at
least it justifies further investigation. <br> &nbsp; <br> Come the
fuck on. How could a boy, 12 years old, not get erect when standing for
that long naked and being fondled and manipulated. That is crap. Also,
not that there is anything wrong with being homosexual, I am straight
and so is my son. It was a simple biological reaction. Oh Brother we
are going to talk about biological reactions in the penis to stimulus a
lot more later. I am now practically an expert, but for now, just know
that it was not a voluntary reaction and he was not aroused and
attracted to Clark and certainly was not responding to a memory of a
prior incident. <br> &nbsp; <br> This letter is detailed, it has to be
or my whole point would be lost. But know that, based on all the
information I had, the entire “interview” up to this point had really
only taken about 20 min. Doyle went to get Kim. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brandon was still standing in the room, naked, with an erection, and
hands behind back. Doyle brought in Kim. Brandon was like, what, can I
get dressed? Clark said, not yet, he had to wait until his erection
went down on its own. Kim, remember she is only 10, going on 11, but
still 10 at this time. Doyle told her to get undressed. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Kim complained that Clark and Brandon were in the room. Doyle said
don’t worry about Clark, he is a social worker and has seen it all
before. She added not to worry about Brandon, because he was already
naked and was more concerned about his modesty than anything Kim would
have. This did not satisfy Kim, but she was scared. She asked for her
mom or Allison. Doyle told her that her mother was the one who wanted
her to be checked. <br> &nbsp; <br> That was either a lie, a mistake,
or Kim got confused. Doyle was right, Brandon was confused and focused
on his nudity, he did not remember what she said exactly. But Doyle did
say something like that her mother needed to have Kim checked. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Kim reluctantly got undressed completely. They did not conduct the ruse
about only to her underwear or any other games like that. Doyle just
told her to get naked. Doyle took her clothes and searched the pockets
and linings. When Kim was completely naked. She is ten years old,
therefore, almost flat chested. She has no pubic hair, just a vaginal
slit. <br> &nbsp; <br> Doyle told Brandon to go to the corner of the
office, which was about 10 feet away and face the corner. She told him
that he could put his hands wherever was comfortable, but to not fidget
or turn around. He was to respect his sister’s privacy. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Doyle asked Kim if, her step-father, me, she got that part right, had
ever touched her inappropriately. She repeated, no. Doyle stood in
front of Kim and dropped to her knees. She had Kim put her foot up on
the chair. Doyle looked at her pussy and anus from the front and side.
She asked Kim what she calls her genitals. Kim said, puss. She asked if
I had ever put my tongue into her anus or puss. Kim said, no. <br>
Doyle then licked Kim on her genitals for several seconds. She then
asked if any adult including her step-father had ever done that. She
said, no. She then turned Kim’s body and licker her asshole, anus, for
a few seconds. She then asked her if anyone had ever done anything like
that with her. Kim said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Doyle told Clark that
Kim had no breasts so there was no need to cover that part of the exam.
But she said that she just needed to confirm no sexual kissing. She
asked Kim whether I had ever kissed her with my tongue. Doyle had Kim
stick out her tongue, and Doyle began sucking it. She did that for a
few seconds and asked if anyone had ever kissed her like that. Kim
said, no. Doyle reached down felt Kim’s vaginal area running her hands
over it. Kim was dry. She told Kim that she believed her. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Doyle told Kim to get dressed. Clark told Brandon to turn around.
Brandon was flaccid. Clark commented to Doyle that it was a good sign.
It did not appear that Brandon was excited by Kim’s exam. Clark
surmised that Brandon had never seen Kim nude or had any sexual contact
with her. He told Brandon to get dressed. <br> &nbsp; <br> What a
fucking idiot Clark is. Brandon gets hard when he has his tongue in
Brandon’s mouth and is playing with his dick. So clearly he has been
molested by his father. But, when he does not get hard after only
hearing an exam of his sister that he did not see, he obviously has not
had any sexual interest or contact with her. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brandon
and Kim got dressed. They were told that they fully cooperated with the
investigation and did a good job. They were advised that they would
need to cooperate further, if the court ordered any additional
investigation. They agreed. Kim did not have a phone, but Brandon did.
Clark took his cell phone. He told Brandon he would get it back at the
end of the day, but they wanted to make sure he did not contact his
sister or parents. Brandon and Kim were sent back to their classes.
Remember the whole ordeal lasted about 30 min from what I can estimate.
<br> &nbsp; <br> I read the report completed by Clark and Doyle. They
acknowledged that they conducted the exam almost exactly the way
Brandon and Kim described. They did not include the comments they made
to Allison, but did indicated that she observed the interview and
confirmed the social workers identities. They concluded that I had not
“yet” molested Kim, but that they could not rule out sexual contact
between myself and Brandon. <br> &nbsp; <br> What a fucking crock of
shit. There is no evidence that I did anything to Kim and they write in
an official investigation report that I had not “YET” molested Kim, as
though I was about to and they intervened just in time. Also even
though, both children denied it and there is no evidence of any kind to
support it, they concluded that they cannot rule out sexual contact
with Brandon. This was crazy. But this was only the beginning. <br> &nbsp; <br>
At the same time, or thereabouts, that Clark and Doyle were
interviewing Brandon and Kim, two social workers from Child Protective
Court Social Services were at ******** Junior High interviewing
Brianna. <br> &nbsp; <br> Now I want to tell you that there are
members of several races involved in all of this. The vast majority of
the culprits are white, but there were several black and Hispanic men
and women involved. I don’t want my message to get lost when I point
out the race of the men or women involved. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
The race is only included as a description, please do not be offended
or assume that I am in anyway racist. I believe in diversity and think
that women of all races and shapes and sexual orientations are
beautiful. I have nothing against homosexual men either. I just happen
to be straight. I repeat please do not hesitate to help me, because you
think that I made an unkind reference to a person’s race, gender,
weight, or sexual orientation. Again I am only including that
information to tell a more descriptive and complete picture. <br> &nbsp; <br>
The two social workers who arrived at ******* Junior High were Ms.
Newman who is white, 38 years old, 5’3” 170, lesbian and Ms. Fuentes,
Hispanic, 43 years old, 5’2 160, lesbian. I know I am only assuming
their orientation, but based on their conduct in the interview and
later at the clinic. I am confident in my identification of their
sexual orientation. <br> &nbsp; <br> They both entered the
administration building and contacted Mrs. Nichols, the V.P. Nichols
was familiar with Fuentes, she had done interviews at the school
before. Those interviews were rare and Fuentes was only involved, if
the abuse was sexual, because her interviews always involved full
investigation, code that I learned means fully nude, genital exam, and
sexual demonstration. <br> &nbsp; <br> By the way, all of this is
fully legal, but should not be. According to Canadian law, Canadian
Criminal Code 163.1 (6), sexual contact can be engaged in with minors
and compelled, if done for the purpose of lawful investigation. The
specific code addressed child pornography, but the courts extrapolated
the statute to include all of this sexual contact during Child
Protective Court investigations. This is total crap, but again just the
beginning. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes greeted Nichols and introduced
Newman as a fellow social worker. Nichols hugged Fuentes and gave her a
kiss on the cheek, even though she did not know Newman, she greeted her
in the same manner. Nichols told me that she does not like Fuentes at
all. She finds her disgusting and thinks that she gets a little too
much pleasure from her work. But there is political power in being an
investigating social worker and Nichols tries to keep Fuentes on her
good side. Again, just like Allison, Nichols is a school administrator
and a mother. <br> &nbsp; <br> I just want to thank Allison, Nichols,
and De Walt for being totally honest with me. They could have simply
brushed me off or believed the Child Protective Court and refused to
speak with me. But they were totally honest in what they witnessed and
even shared their personal feelings about the social workers and what
happened. I know they like my children and were upset about the
investigation. I think they are upset about all investigations, but I
know they are in no position to change anything. I just want to thank
Nichols at this point, for sharing her thoughts. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols’ office is in the corner of the admin building right across
from the principal’s office. There is a receptionist secretary desk in
between the two offices. The office is all windowed, but it has blinds
that can be lowered. Fuentes asked Nichols if they could speak to her
in her office. Nichols agreed, remember Fuentes was not really asking.
Newman, Fuentes, and Nichols went in to her office and Fuentes began to
close the side window blinds. When they were closed, it only left the
front window open, the one that faced the reception secretary desk. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Newman sat at a small round table in the room. Nichols was about to sit
at her desk, when Fuentes sat on the small sofa in the office and asked
her to sit next to her. Nichols smiled and sat next to her. Fuentes
told her that they were there on official business and needed to
interview Brianna Wilks. <br> Nichols rhetorically asked what it was
about and if she could be of assistance. Fuentes said that she could
not reveal the details, but there have been allegations of abuse.
Nichols looked nervous, so Fuentes clarified that the suspected abuser
was me, her father. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes told Nichols that she
needed her to have Brianna brought to the admin building immediately
for an interview. Nichols knew exactly what that meant. Fuentes told
Nichols that they would use her office for the interview. Nichols told
Fuentes that the office was at her disposal. Fuentes had her hand on
Nichols’ knee the entire time. Nichols wanted to slap it off, but well
you get it. Nichols asked if there was anything else, Fuentes said no,
at this time, but depending on the results of the interview, they may
need more assistance. Nichols was not positive, but thought she knew
what that meant. Make a note of that, I will bring it up and later. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols got up and started to close the front window blind. Fuentes
asked her what she was doing. Nichols said giving her more privacy.
Fuentes told her to leave them open, because the investigation is not
done in secret and that way Nichols can observe if she wants and verify
that everything was done properly. Nichols smiled and said, of course.
Nichols was disgusted, she knew that Fuentes wanted her to watch to add
to Brianna’s embarrassment and to cover her ass if anyone said that the
interview was not proper. Nichols agreed to work at the reception desk
and observe. Fuentes looked at Newman and nodded, as if to say, I told
you I had control over Nichols. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols walked out
and contacted school security to have Brianna pulled from class.
Nichols left the area, to avoid any more conversation with Fuentes.
Within 15 min, security brought Brianna to Nichols office. Fuentes
introduced herself and Newman as Officials of the Canadian Child
Protective Court Social Services. They told Brianna that they needed to
interview her as a possible victim of abuse. Fuentes told her that it
was reported that she had been treated inappropriately by her father. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brianna is a 14 year old girl and has lived with me her entire life,
until the divorce. She still lives with me on weekends. There has never
been any inappropriate contact or really any contact other than hugs
and cheek kisses, which she likes. She tried to tell them that there
was a mistake, maybe they had the wrong girl. There was no problem with
her dad. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes said that the investigation would
reveal that. Most children are reluctant to testify or provide evidence
against their parents. They fear physical retaliation, additional
abuse, that they won’t be believed, or that they will be sent to foster
care or juvenile facility. We simply cannot take your word for it. We
are on your side and we will simply ask you a series of questions that
will elicit the truth. If you are honest, the questions are easy, but
if you lie, you will be tripped up by your answers. We will also need
to do a quick visual exam, that is why there are no men here, and
terminology check. We just need to make sure you understand some of the
adult terms we are using. <br> &nbsp; <br> Newman was seated at the
table and Fuentes was on the sofa. Newman pulled out a manual and read
the first part to Brianna. It explained the investigation and the
purpose. The purpose was to determine whether allegations were true or
false. She told her that it was just as important to clear the innocent
as convict the guilty. Fuentes told her that she needed to fully
cooperate in order to clear her dad or if the facts indicate abuse than
she needed to be honest and tell them, so her dad, me, could be sent to
prison and never see her again. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna
was terrified they surprise her tell her she needs to talk about false
allegations and if she does not cooperate her dad will go to prison.
Brianna got wide eyed and scared and agreed to answer their questions.
Fuentes told her that she was going to be fine and all she had to do
was answer questions and tell the truth. <br> &nbsp; <br> That was a
fucking lie. Fuentes knew that the interview was not going to be just
questions. Brianna was going to have to strip completely naked and let
them look at and touch every part of her body. Also they knew that they
were going to have Brianna touch them. Those fucking lesbian bitches.
They knew that they were going to do the full investigation from the
very beginning regardless of anything that Brianna told them. Sorry
again, I have nothing against lesbians. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols knew
also. She was now sitting in the reception desk chair doing her work
and keeping an eye on her office and the interview as she had been
instructed by Fuentes. Nichols knew the law and knew that Fuentes was
pretty much untouchable when it came to investigations. She is allowed
to examine anyone she suspects is involved as a victim or suspect. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols is married and has a son. Luckily, unlike De Walt and Allison
who have daughters. Fuentes, Doyle, and Martinez are lesbians and could
“interview” their daughters if they wanted to get back at De Walt or
Allison. However, Nichols knows all too well that, unlike Doyle and
Martinez (I’ll introduce later) who prefer girls 16 and under, Fuentes
is more open minded and likes girls and women of all ages. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols knows that Fuentes is interested in her. Nichols has made it
clear and politely told Fuentes that she is not a lesbian and not
attracted to any woman. She had to be diplomatic about it and make a
point that it is all women that she is not interested in, not just
Fuentes, not just Hispanics, or women who are overweight, or women who
are just ugly. Sorry to say it, but to me, just in my opinion, Doyle,
Martinez, and Fuentes are all ugly, fat, hairy, bad complexion, women.
But that is just my taste and personal preference. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols also knows that Fuentes does not like rejection and does not
really care whether a sexual encounter is consensual or non-consensual.
After all she enjoys the forced nudity and contact that she gets with
the child victims she interviews. So Nichols is careful with Fuentes
and just tries to be cordial and polite. But Fuentes has threatened to
have her assist with investigations or therapy. Nichols did not want to
tell me this, but I found out later that Fuentes did require/force her
to do at least one therapy photo session. I’ll touch on that later. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Newman asked Brianna what her relationship was like with her mother.
She said that it was good, but that her mother is upset a lot lately.
Newman asked if her mother, my ex, was upset because of something that
her father, me, had done. She thought about it and said, yes. Fuentes
looked at Newman. Newman asked what I had done to upset her mother.
Brianna said it had something to do with support and abuse. Fuentes
asked her what kind of abuse. Brianna told her that her mother needed
more money and complained that her dad was financially abusing her mom
and her and her brother. Fuentes then twisted her words, so you heard
your mother complain that your father was abusing you and your brother.
She said, yes. Did you correct her? Did you say anything? Brianna said,
no. She just let her mother vent. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Newman asked what her relationship was like with her dad, me. She said
it was great. She loved to visit on weekends and loved it when we all
lived together. Then Brianna said she liked it except for the fights
and abuse. Brianna admitted that she used the word fights, she also
said she might have used the word abuse, but she meant verbal arguments
that her mother had with me. Fuentes did not ask her to clarify
properly. <br> &nbsp; <br> Newman asked Brianna whether I had ever
yelled at her. She said, no. Fuentes asked whether I had ever kissed
her on the lips or mouth. She said, yes. I assume she meant when she
was a very little tiny girl. I did give her kisses on the mouth. But I
am sure I stopped when she was like 7 or 8. She was not asked to
clarify the age of the last kiss. Fuentes then asked whether I had ever
touched her in her swimsuit area. She said, no. She told her that I do
not help her get dressed or in the bathroom. Fuentes told her that she
was changing the subject. She asked her again. Has your father ever
touched you on your swimsuit area. She said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes asked her again, but in a different way. Has your dad ever
touched your breasts? Brianna was shocked and said, no. Fuentes asked
her whether I had ever touched her ass or anus. She said, no. Fuentes
asked what Brianna calls her genitals. Brianna said her vagina or
pussy. Fuentes asked her whether her dad had ever touched her pussy.
She said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Newman asked Brianna whether she was a
virgin. Brianna said, yes. Fuentes asked if she had gone through
puberty. Brianna asked to clarify. Fuentes asked, do you have pussy
hair? Brianna said, yes. Fuentes asked do you have tits? Brianna said,
yes. Fuentes asked, have you had a period? Brianna said, yes. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes asked, Brianna, has anyone put anything in your pussy. Brianna
said, yes. A doctor examined her pussy and put in a tool. Brianna told
Fuentes that her mother showed her how to use a tampon. Fuentes asked
Brianna who helps her purchase tampons and underwear. Brianna said her
mother or her step-mother Dawn. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes looked at
Newman. Fuentes asked, has your step-mother shown you how to insert a
tampon. Brianna said, no, because she already was shown. Fuentes asked
if her step-mother help her try on underwear or bras at the store.
Brianna was suspecting a trick questions. Brianna told her, you don’t
try on underwear at the store. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked Brianna,
have you ever seen your mothers pussy? Brianna said, yes. At some point
her mother has changed with her or walked around the house without
clothes on. Fuentes asked Brianna, is your mothers pussy shaved or
hairy? Brianna was about to ask why, but Fuentes cut her off. We just
need to verify your answers. We already know the answer and so should
you. Brianna said that her mother’s pussy is hairy. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes asked, have you seen your step-mother’s pussy? Brianna said,
yes. Fuentes asked how that happened. Brianna said that they have
changed at the beach in the locker together and she saw it. Fuentes
asked whether her step-mother had seen her pussy. Brianna said, yes I
think so. Fuentes asked, is your step-mother’s pussy hairy. Brianna
said, sometimes. Newman asked what that meant. Brianna told her that
she has seen it a few times and one time it was shaved, others times
very hairy. Fuentes asked, what is very hairy? Brianna said you know a
lot of tangled hair. Fuentes laughed, smiled, and said ok. <br>
Fuentes asked, what about you, is your pussy hairy? Brianna said, yes.
Brianna said that she is not allowed to shave. She said that her father
will not let her shave. Fuentes looked at Newman and nodded. Fuentes
asked why her father did not let her shave her pussy. Brianna said he
probably likes it to be hairy. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuck I am sure she was
just joking, because they were talking about an embarrassing subject
and Fuentes had made a joke and laughed earlier. What actually happened
was that we were at the grocery store and Brandon asked me if he needed
to buy razors. I told him not for a few years. Then Brianna picked up
the most expensive 5 blade razor and asked if she could have it. I
looked at her like she was joking and said no, you can just let your
hair grow. Fuck. I thought she was talking about shaving her face. She
never said to shave her legs or genitals. Also if she had told me, I
would have allowed her to get a razor, but not a 25 dollar disposable. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes had heard enough she picked up her phone and called Doyle. She
told Doyle that Brianna had told the truth and the allegations have
substance. Fuentes suggested that Doyle do a full interview. Fuentes
made a few jokes and assured Doyle that she and Newman were going to do
a full interview of Brianna. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked Brianna,
have you seen your fathers thing. Brianna is 14 years old. They were
just talking about all of their hairy pussies, but Fuentes could not
say penis, dick, or cock. Brianna said, yes. Fuentes asked if it was
hairy? Brianna said, yes. <br> &nbsp; <br> I figure she saw me
changing once, or it is possible that the only time she saw it was when
we were at the beach and Dawn pulled down on my swimsuit. It was not
tied tight and it went down a few inches. The entire penis was not
exposed. But oh well, I guess Brianna saw it and she told Fuentes. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes told Brianna that due to her answers they need to examine her
to make sure she was telling the truth. That she really has hair and
that her boobs are developed. Brianna is shy, but not like Riley.
Brianna agree to show them, but she asked if they could go to the
locker room or bathroom. Newman told her that they were in a private
office and the only one who could see is them and Nichols. Brianna
agreed to quickly show them her pussy and boobs. Fuentes said that is
just about all we need. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes lied. She had no
intention of a quick flask exam. She was going to do the full exam. She
told Brianna to take off everything she had on and get completely naked
and put her clothes on the table near Newman. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna
froze out of fear. She said I can just pull them down quick and you can
see the hair. Fuentes repeated get undressed completely so we can
finish. Brianna started to take off her shoes. Nichols was watching.
She wanted to leave, but then Fuentes caught her eye and gave her a
look. Briana took off her socks. She took of her sweater and her shirt
and handed them to Newman. Newman told her to keep going. Brianna took
off her jeans and put them on the table. Newman checked seams and
pockets. Fuentes told her to keep going. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna
pulled up the panties from the thigh area across her genital area and
revealed her hairy pussy. She told Fuentes, see. Fuentes said, just get
them off. We are required to do this. We don’t want to send your father
to prison if we don’t have to. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna took off her
bra and handed it to Newman. She covered her breasts with her arm as
she took down her panties. She covered her crotch area with her hand as
Newman looked at the panties and bra. Fuentes told her to stand in
front of the sofa so she could look at her. She took out a cloth tape
measure. Fuentes told her that they have to measure her thighs,
stomach, chest, neck, and upper arms. Fuentes took the tape measure and
measured her neck and upper arms. Fuentes had Brianna raise her arms
and she measured her chest at the nipple line. She touched the nipples
and asked if they get pointier when touched. Brianna said, sometimes.
Fuentes told her she wanted an accurate measure so she flicked the
nipples a few times and they did get a little hard. Fuentes called out
the measure to Newman. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes bent down and measured
Brianna’s inner upper thigh. She got a measure in the upper part with
her hands in Brianna’s pubic hair. Fuentes commented to Brianna, you
were telling the truth about your hair. She told her, you are hairy.
Fuentes added that, I guess that is how your dad likes it and she
laughed, which made Brianna laugh. Fuentes asked her if she thought she
was “very hairy” like her step-mother. Brianna said, no not that hairy.
<br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes told her that they are going to ask more
questions about her step-mother and her father, but they need to
explain terminology and confirm her understanding. Even though Brianna
is 14 and in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade, they still needed to confirm
basic vocabulary with demonstration. That is what the Child Protective
Court agreed was the correct procedure. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna was
standing there fully naked in front of Newman and Fuentes, with Nichols
observing through the window from the desk. Fuentes asked Brianna to
point to Brianna’s lips and mouth. Brianna pointed to her mouth.
Fuentes told Brianna to touch Fuentes’ mouth. Brianna took her finger
and touched Fuentes lips/mouth. Fuentes asked Brianna to touch her own
breast. Brianna touched her own breast. She asked Brianna to touch her
own nipple. Brianna touched her own nipple. Fuentes asked Brianna to
touch her own pussy. Brianna touched her pussy. Fuentes asked Brianna
to confirm that her step-mother had kissed her lips, seen her breasts,
and seen her pussy. Brianna confirmed. She asked Brianna to confirm
that her father had kissed her lips. She confirmed. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Newman handed Brianna a list of sexual terms. Fuentes told that Brianna
some of the questions she was about to ask may be repeats. She advised
her to just make sure you give the correct answer. Fuentes told her
that for the next part, which was the last part of the interview, She
was going to have Brianna show her the meaning of various terms.
Fuentes told her that If she used a term that Brianna did not
understand for her to tell her and ask her to demonstrate. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes said closed mouth kiss. Brianna said that is like a granny kiss
just a peck. Fuentes told her, that is correct, but you need to
demonstrate. So do not use words just show me. Brianna was confused.
Fuentes said give me a granny kiss and Fuentes puckered up. Brianna
felt weird and gross, but gave her a kiss on the lips. Fuentes told her
the next phrase is French kiss. Brianna said that is when you kiss open
mouth with tongue. Fuentes said that is right, but no words just show
me. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brianna was naked and being told that she had to French kiss this ugly
old fat Hispanic woman. I know 43 is not that old, but the rest is
accurate and to Brianna it is old. She looked out the window and saw
that Nichols was on the phone. She could not hear the conversation, but
Nichols was talking covering the phone with her hand and looking at
Brianna. Brianna was sure she was on the phone talking to someone about
what she was doing with the women. Brianna was worried that Nichols was
going to report that she was not cooperating. She did not know what the
conversation was, but that was her fear. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna
opened her mouth and leaned forward to Fuentes. Fuentes opened her
mouth and told Brianna to put her tongue in Fuentes’ mouth. Brianna,
still looking at Nichols decided that she is going to do everything she
is told. Otherwise, Nichols the VP would report her and Fuentes would
send her dad to prison. She kept kissing and moving her tongue around,
until Fuentes pulled back and told her that the next phrase is suck
tit. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna, glad to have her tongue out of Fuentes’
mouth, pulled up on her breast and pointed her nipple at Fuentes.
Fuentes put the nipple in her mouth and sucked. After like 5 seconds,
Fuentes said that it will be her turn once Fuentes and Newman get
undressed. Brianna just nodded. <br> &nbsp; <br> The last one on this
list is cunnilingus, oral sex, or pussy lick. Brianna put her hands on
her waist and pulled her pussy open a little. She then leaned back and
pushed her pelvis out toward Fuentes. Fuentes gave her pussy a lick for
about 5 seconds. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked whether or mother,
father, or step-mother had ever done anything like that with her
before. Brianna told Fuentes and Newman, no. Newman began to get
undressed. She took of her shoes and socks. Then she took off her
button up shirt and bra. Next off came the pants and panties. Newman
had decent size breasts and her pussy was trimmed in a cropped shape
and had hair but cut short. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked Brianna if
her mother or step-mother had boobs or tits like Newman. Brianna said
that her mother had boobs close but not quite as big. But Fuentes just
heard that they were close. Fuentes asked Brianna whether she had ever
sucked her mother’s breast. Brianna said, no. Fuentes reminded her that
she had to tell the truth and she was asked if ever. Fuentes said what
about as a baby. Brianna said she was not sure. Fuentes told her go
suck on Newman’s tits and see if it refreshes her memory. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Suck on her tits to see if it refreshes memory. What a crock of shit.
But that is legal. The court had no problem with that. It was just for
the investigation and was not considered an improper request at all.
Brianna had to comply or she would have been held in contempt. That is
what the court decided. It was of no point, because she did comply, but
still. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna went over and sucked on Newman’s
breast. She sucked on it for probably a minute, before Fuentes asked
her if she had remembered doing that with her mother. Brianna said no
she still did not remember. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked if she had
ever kissed or inserted anything inside of her mother’s pussy. Brianna
said, no. Again Fuentes tried to twist it around. She told Brianna, you
know that you were inside your mothers pussy and your lips fingers and
toes were all inside. Brianna said I guess. I know that, but I don’t
remember. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes ordered Brianna to lick Newman for
a minute and then stick a finger inside of her. Brianna had already
made up her mind that she had no choice but to comply. She lowered her
head and stuck out her tongue and began licking Newman. After about a
minute, or two, Fuentes told her to keep licking but also stick in a
finger. Brianna did. Fuentes asked her if any adult had ever had her do
that, except her mother during birth. Brianna said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes got undressed. Brianna watched her take off her clothes one
piece at a time. Fuentes Breasts were uneven and one was sticking out
more and the other pointed down. When Fuentes took off her panties,
Brianna thought she knew why Fuentes kept asking about hair. Fuentes
was hairy. She had hair on her pussy all the way into the leg area and
the hair went up to her belly button. Brianna noticed that Fuentes also
had hairy armpits. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes asked Brianna if her
step-mother had breasts that were more like Newman or her. Brianna said
more like her. Fuck she wanted to say neither, but there was no option.
Also Brianna is not stupid she knew what would happen if she said
Newman, she would have to suck those again. Brianna just decided to do
what she knew was the best thing she could for herself and her dad.
Brianna is a smart girl and I know she tried to help me. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Brianna said that her step-mother’s boobs look more like Fuentes, but
not as nice and pretty. Fuentes did not smile or laugh. She just asked
Brianna, have you ever licked or sucked on your step-mothers boobs.
Fuentes told her, if the answer is no, just tell me. If yes tell me, if
you don’t remember that is an acceptable answer as well. Brianna was
about to say no. She has never touched or sucked on Dawn’s breasts. But
just to see if it would possibly help, Brianna also worried that there
was a chance that she did in some circumstance in the past, just like
how Fuentes twisted the answer to include when she was a baby or in
child birth. Brianna answered, I don’t remember or know for sure. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes said, that is ok Brianna we can just have you demonstrate and
just do your best to try to remember. If you still don’t remember that
is ok. It is better than not telling me the truth. Fuentes leaned back
on the sofa and Brianna went over to her and put her head into her left
breast. The left breast was the one that pointed out and was about in
the middle of her upper arm. <br> &nbsp; <br> Brianna began sucking
and she saw the Newman was watching her and taking notes. Brianna
sucked on that nipple for at least 2 minutes. Fuentes then asked
whether she recalled anything. Brianna said still not sure. Brianna
said she did not want to say yes or no, because the wrong answer could
get her dad sent to prison. Fuentes told her that she was absolutely
correct. Fuentes told her to try the other breast. The right breast
pointed down and was sagging to Fuentes elbow. Brianna put it in her
mouth and sucked it gently. Fuentes told Brianna that she was a very
smart and pretty girl. She finally asked her again. Has your
step-mother or any other adult ever asked you to do this before.
Brianna said, no. Fuentes then told her before you get up, I want you
to try one thing, I have seen this stir memories before, so I need you
to do it. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes told Brianna to bury her face in
Fuentes armpit and lick the armpit until she tells her to stop or she
can stop as soon as she remembers doing the same thing with her
step-mother or father. Brianna stuck her face in Fuentes armpit and
began licking her hair. Brianna kept licking for a few minutes, wanting
to stop and throw up, but Fuentes told her to continue until she
remembered or was told to stop. After about 2 min, Fuentes asked her if
it helped her remember, Brianna said, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes
asked Brianna if her step-mother’s very hairy pussy was similar to
Fuentes’. Fuentes had far more hair than Dawn, but Brianna said that it
was close. Fuentes asked her what was different. Brianna told her that
she had more hair on leg area and tummy than her step-mother. Fuentes
told her that she was correct. Fuentes made it sound like she had
talked and maybe even seen Dawn’s pubic hair. Fuentes asked her if she
had ever licked her step-mother’s pussy. She said even if it was just
one lick. Brianna told her, no. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes told Brianna
to lower herself down to the floor and lick her pussy, until she can be
sure of an answer. Brianna lowered herself to the floor, stuck out her
tongue, and licked on Fuentes’ hairy pussy, until finally Fuentes asked
her if she had done that before. Brianna said no. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes pulled Brianna up and brought her face close to hers. She told
her that she did a good job licking her pussy and sucking on her
breasts. Fuentes asked her how she had learned to do that. Brianna said
that she was just doing as she was told. Fuentes told her that she was
doing it very well. Fuentes leaned toward Brianna with her mouth open
and tongue peeking out. Brianna opened her mouth and gave Fuentes
another long open mouth kiss. Fuentes asked her why she was such a good
kisser. Brianna told her she has kissed before, but not like that. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes asked Brianna if she had ever had her head between her father’s
legs and licked. Brianna said, no. Fuentes said are you certain.
Brianna thought hard and said I don’t remember ever doing anything like
that. She asked Brianna whether she would do it, if her father asked
her to. Brianna said, yes. I think she was just going along and was
already in the frame of mind that she was going to do as told. Besides
it was just a hypothetical question. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes then
asked Brianna whether she liked sucking on Fuentes’ breasts. The ones
that looked like her step-mother’s. That is such a fucking loaded
question. If she says no, then Fuentes is insulted and Brianna thinks
she will retaliate by sending her father to prison. So she said the
only thing she could, yes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes then asked Brianna
whether she liked licking her very hairy pussy, like her step-mother’s
the way she normally has it. Brianna answered, yes. Fuentes smiled. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes then kissed Brianna again. She asked Brianna if she liked
kissing and being loving with adult women or does she prefer arguing or
fighting like her father did with her mother. Brianna said being nice
and loving. She asked Brianna if she wanted another kiss. What is she
going to say? If Brianna says no, then she lied in her last answer.
Brianna said, yes. Fuentes gave her another long kiss. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes asked Brianna whether Brianna is attracted to girls or boys.
Brianna said boys and that she is not attracted at all to girls.
Fuentes thanked her for being honest and told her that sometimes just
for an interview or for court Brianna may have to do some stuff with
girls, but that she will also get to do stuff with boys, men, and
women. Brianna just stayed quiet. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes told Newman
to get dressed and told Brianna to just wait. Newman got dressed and
then Fuentes got dressed. Brianna was still naked and trying to cover.
Fuentes told Newman that they needed to check on the others and that
they were done there. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes
told Brianna that they had all the information they needed. Brianna had
seen her father naked, Brianna was told that she had to keep her pussy
hairy, her father and step-mother had seen her naked, Brianna said that
she had never sucked on an adult breast or licked an adult pussy – but
had no difficulty or objection to doing it, her father kisses her on
the mouth, she stated that she enjoyed sex with adults, and that if
requested she would perform oral sex on her father. Newman nodded. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes opened the door, with Brianna still standing naked waiting for
instructions to dress. Fuentes called Nichols over. Fuentes told Newman
to go to the parking lot and get the car and pull it out front. She
added that Newman needed to contact Doyle and Martinez to see what they
learned and make sure they were finished. Newman left the office. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Nichols was now standing in the doorway and saw that Brianna was still
standing naked covering herself in shame. Nichols did not say a word.
Fuentes told her that they finished the interview and got a lot of
information. Brianna had a phone, but it was not on her. Fuentes told
Nichols to get a security guard to bring Brianna back to her locker to
get her phone. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols went to reception and paged
security. Fuentes told Brianna that she needed to go with security to
get her phone and she would have to give it to Nichols and she could
get it at the end of the day. She was not to contact any member of her
family, until she got home from school. <br> &nbsp; <br> A security
guard arrived at the office door. He noticed Brianna naked in the
office and had a shocked expression. Fuentes told him to get out of
there. He moved aside and she told him to locate a female security
guard, because Brianna needed an escort to the girls locker room. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes was basically cursing to herself about Nichols. Nichols came
back from the front of admin and asked what happened with security.
Fuentes pulled her into the office and shut the door. Fuentes told
Nichols that a female security was needed and she had told Nichols that
the purpose of the escort was to take Brianna to the girls locker room
to get her phone. Nichols apologized for the confusion and said that
she did understand but did not make it clear when she paged. Fuentes
confronted her and said, well if you understood than why did you come
here confused about the security issue, you knew they sent the wrong
gender. <br> &nbsp; <br> Nichols got quiet and said nothing. Nichols
also noticed that Brianna was still standing in the room naked. Fuentes
told Nichols that she better pay more attention to instructions.
Nichols apologized again. Fuentes told her that she forgave her and
asked for a hug. I use the word ask, because Nichols said, come on
let’s just drop this over a hug. Nichols understood and gave Fuentes a
big hug and squeeze. Nichols was going to let go, but Fuentes said is
that all. Brianna here is watching and is going to think we are still
upset with each other. Especially after the way her parents were
fighting which led to her abuse. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuentes was still
holding Nichols and they were in an embrace, non-consensual on the part
of Nichols, but that goes without saying. Fuentes, is such a bitch.
Alright I will just say what she said and you the reader can decide.
Fuentes in the embrace told Nichols that the matter was considered
over. She said, you apologized for not paying attention when I told you
to get a security guard to escort Brianna and you apologized for trying
to cover it up with a lie. Fuentes was smiling and Nichols had a fake
smile and agreed and kept hugging. Fuentes told Nichols, I guess I have
to spell it out. You greeted me properly when I arrived. So how do you
say goodbye. Nichols laughed and said, oh yeah. Nichols then gave
Fuentes a kiss on her cheek. Fuentes said and the other. Fuentes then
turned her head and Nichols kissed the other cheek. <br> Fuentes told
Nichols, I know you are married, but when can we at least get a drink.
Nichols laughed and said her husband would be jealous and she does not
swing that way. Then she added that if she ever changes teams, Fuentes
would be her first contact. Fuentes was satisfied and let her go. <br> &nbsp; <br>
The female security guard knocked on the door. Fuentes opened the door
and allowed her to enter. Fuentes told the guard to take Brianna to her
locker to get her phone. The guard was to take the phone and give it to
Nichols. The guard agreed. Nichols, on eggshells, asked Fuentes, if she
was finished with Brianna and if Brianna could get dressed. Fuentes
said of course, she is not going across campus naked. If you were to
let her do that, Nichols I have to interview you. They both laughed. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Fuentes left the building and went into the parking lot. Nichols told
Brianna to get dressed and go to the locker room and get her phone. She
was to give the phone to the guard and then return to her class. The
guard returned about 10 min later with Brianna’s phone. At the end of
the day, Brianna’s phone was returned. <br> &nbsp; <br> While all of
that transpired behind my back, there was another two social workers at
****** High School interviewing Riley. Riley is not my daughter, but I
respect her and provide for her as my own. I agreed to that when I
became involved with Dawn. I do not completely trust Riley, so it is
possible that some of the conversation as she described it to me was
misconstrued or misremembered. However, most of the physical
description that Riley provided matched what De Walt told me later and
what Martinez and Banes wrote in their reports. The rest of the high
school staff refused to talk to me at all. <br> &nbsp; <br> Ms.
Martinez, Hispanic, 51 years old, 5’4” 145 pounds, lesbian dyke bitch,
and Ms. Banes, Black, 39 years old, 5’7” 210 pounds bi-sexual, pulled
up to the front of ******* High School. They were greeted by the
security guards Ms. Harris, White, 29 years old, 5’3” 195 pounds,
lesbian dyke bitch and Mr. Kline, White 34 years old, 5’10” 250 pounds,
fat, stupid, pervert, bi-sexual. Sorry but that is accurate. I have to
admit, the guards did not talk to me, so I am speculating as to what
they were thinking, but I am sure I am on point. <br> &nbsp; <br> De
Walt told me that Harris is almost always present when Martinez
conducts child welfare interviews. She also told me that, if a brother
and sister are interviewed or if a male is needed, Kline will ask to
assist. So based on that and what transpired in the interview, I
believe I have an accurate enough impression of what they were thinking
when Martinez arrived. Martinez also made a record in her report of her
discussions with Harris and Kline. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez exited
her car and greeted Harris and Kline. Harris gave Martinez a hug. I
think that Harris likes Martinez and wanted to give her a hug. Martinez
introduced Banes as a new social worker in training. Harris shook
Banes’ hand. Kline shook Martinez’ and Banes’ hand. Harris asked
Martinez what she was working on. Martinez told her that she needed to
do an interview with Riley *****, Dawn’s maiden name and still Riley’s
last name. Note to forum editor, you can censor her last name. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Harris became excited and inquired as to whether it would be a full
interview. Banes looked at Martinez, as to indicate that she did not
understand and was curious as to the difference between an interview
and full interview. Martinez told her that she was not sure at that
time. She told her that the allegations were scant and she needed to
uncover more info to even have a basic idea of the scope of the
investigation. <br> &nbsp; <br> Fuck, I figured I had her at that.
Martinez even wrote in her report that the allegations were vague and
that she really had no idea what she was investigating. But no, the
advocate argued that all investigations are fact finding and the
initial scope would often change during the investigation. The court
agreed, big surprise. <br> &nbsp; <br> Kline asked Martinez whether he
would be able to assist in the interview. Martinez told him that the
first thing he could do to assist was to locate Riley and have her
brought up to the administration building. Kline responded, affirmative
ma’am. Kline left the area to locate Riley. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez
asked Harris whether she was familiar with Riley. Harris told her yes.
Harris described Riley as being a very cute pretty 16 year old white
girl with long sandy blond hair. Harris continued and told her that
Riley had a super cute face and lovely blue eyes. Martinez and Harris
smiled at each other. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Harris about
Riley’s breasts. Harris told her that she had not seen Riley’s breasts
other than with clothes on. Harris told her that they looked small and
underdeveloped for 16. Martinez nodded her head as though that was an
important investigative fact. She looked at Banes and told her to write
down everything Harris told her about her description of Riley. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Harris about Riley’s genitals. Banes looked at Martinez
puzzled, because, how could Harris describe Riley’s genitals? Without
Banes even having to ask the question, Martinez looked at Banes and
told her that Harris goes through the locker room during her patrol and
will see girls changing for gym class, Banes nodded. Harris told her
that Riley is very shy. She added that Riley does not fully undress to
change for gym class. Riley puts her gym clothes over the same
underwear. Harris has only seen Riley in her underwear. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Banes to note that Riley was underdeveloped, showing
signs of late or retarded puberty, and was overly modest. Harris asked
if the information she was providing was useful. Martinez told her that
all information is useful regardless of whether it proves or disproves
an allegation. Harris then cautiously asked Martinez whether she could
assist in the interview. Harris added, not that you need help or
anything, just offering in case you do. Martinez thanked her for the
offer and replied, we’ll see. <br> &nbsp; <br> All this crap in the
parking lot before they even went inside. Martinez was planning to do a
full investigation from that point. I am sure of it. It did not matter
what Riley told her. Banes I think had some training in interviews, but
was more open minded about what the interview would entail. However,
Martinez was clearly in charge and Banes was in training. Make no
mistake, I am sure Banes got into this for the fringe benefits, but she
was new, so just not as bad as Martinez. <br> &nbsp; <br> Harris left
to catch up with Kline. Martinez and Banes entered the administration
building. The receptionist saw Martinez enter the building and became
nervous and probably anxious and excited. Martinez had been a
supervising social worker for over 5 years and a social worker for 10
years prior to that. She has done many interviews at all of the schools
in the jurisdiction. Martinez is even more of a bitch than Fuentes. I
think it is because Martinez has more years and is a supervisor. <br> &nbsp; <br>
The receptionist waved at Martinez and Banes. Martinez approached and
told her that they needed to speak with V.P. De Walt. The Receptionist
picked up the phone and told De Walt that Martinez was in the building.
De Walt came out and greeted Martinez. Martinez greeted De Walt and
introduced Banes. They all shook hands. <br> &nbsp; <br> De Walt knew
why Martinez was there, she only came to the schools to interview
students. All other school visits for records or other interviews were
done by different social workers. So De Walt simply asked Martinez, who
are you here to see? Martinez told her that she was there to interview
Riley ******. De Walt had to control herself to prevent rolling her
eyes. She simply told Martinez that she would have her brought up.
Martinez told her that Kline and Harris were already locating her and
will escort her to the building. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez was looking
over De Walt. According to what others have told me, De Walt is too old
for Martinez, but I guess she still likes to look. As they waited,
awkwardly. De Walt told Martinez that she and Banes could use the
conference room in the admin building. The conference room had windows
that only face inward to the hall and window blinds. It was located at
the end of a hallway, so not much traffic would walk by or make noise.
It was directly across from the staff lunch room, but the lunch room
had no windows and was usually not used at that time. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told De Walt that the conference room was fine. Martinez
usually requested, insisted, to use either the principal’s office or De
Walt’s office. De Walt always offered the conference room, if it was
available, and sometimes Martinez would use it. De Walt put on fake
pleasantries with Martinez. She told her that it was good to see her.
She also complimented Martinez on her figure and her outfit. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez was wearing one piece long black and gold modest dress. The
neckline was tasteful and discrete. The dress was old and worn around
the edges. Martinez had worn it the last three times De Walt saw her.
De Walt assumed she only had one dress. De Walt could clearly see the
panty lines showing through and the bra that was clearly not being held
in place. Martinez had floppy sagging dog ear boobs, De Walt could tell
even through her clothes. But De Walt still told Martinez that she
looked very beautiful with her long hair. Martinez actually does have
nice long hair, but it is black and grey and thinning. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked De Walt if she was familiar with Riley. De Walt said not
really. Riley is not a discipline issue and had never been in the
office other than to register or turn in absence notes. Martinez, asked
how often is she absent. De Walt estimated that Riley missed school
approximately 1 day every two months. Martinez made a big deal of that.
She told Banes to note that and to have someone get the attendance
records for Riley. De Walt told her that she had no more information
about Riley. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez, being the bitch, asked De Walt
whether her 15 year old daughter, Jessica, had any shared classes or
was friends with Riley. De Walt knew where Martinez might be headed.
Martinez is a perverted lesbian pedophile. Not my words. That is De
Walt’s impression. I make no judgements. Still De Walt wanted to be as
friendly as she could with Martinez and try to appeal to any sense of
honor or kindness. <br> &nbsp; <br> De Walt moved into Martinez
personal space and started talking to her closely. Banes looked
puzzled, but could tell that De Walt was being very cautiously
respectful to Martinez. Banes could see Martinez power. De Walt told
Martinez that she does not think that Jessica is familiar with Riley.
De Walt put her arm around Martinez waist and told her that she would
get Riley’s class schedule and compare it to Jessica’s to see if they
have any classes together. Martinez thanked her, but added that De Walt
should give a copy of both schedules to Banes before they leave. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
De Walt said, of course. She added that she was pretty sure that
Jessica had no classes with Riley and had never heard Jessica mention
Riley. Martinez told her that she was probably correct, as Jessica was
a sophomore 10<sup>th</sup> grade and Riley was a junior 11<sup>th</sup>
grade. However, Martinez added sometimes an interview with a potential
witness can clear up issues. De Walt said, of course, but I could just
ask Jessica if she knows Riley at all and I can tell you. De Walt said
you could even interview me. De Walt knew that that would entail, but
offered just to protect Jessica. De Walt was really close to Martinez
and as gross as it would be, would have kissed her, if they were not in
public just to appease her. <br> &nbsp; <br> Harris finally showed up
with Riley. Martinez smiled, because she saw that Riley really was a
cute as she had been described. Riley was also very timid and shy.
Martinez could see that, just by the way Riley was standing and looking
around. Martinez let De Walt off easy. She told her, just check the
schedules. If they don’t have any shared classes, then the matter is
dropped. De Walt removed her hand from around Martinez waist, but
stroked her butt as she went across. Martinez smiled at De Walt. They
understood each other. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez walked up to Harris
and Kline and told them that they could leave, but to be available if
necessary. They agreed and left the area. Martinez introduced herself
and Banes to Riley. They all shook hands. Martinez told Riley that they
just needed to ask her a few questions about an allegation. They told
her that they would talk to her in private in the conference room. <br> &nbsp; <br>
They all walked down the hall to the conference room. They entered and
turned on the lights. There were 3 tables in the room and a sofa along
the wall. The only windows faced into the hall. There were no exterior
facing windows. The windows had full blinds, with block out seams, but
they were all raised. Across from the conference room was the staff
lunch area, but it was closed and locked. Martinez told Riley and Banes
that the room was perfect and was completely private. Martinez
reiterated that the room was soundproof and nobody could hear anything
that they discussed. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley seemed to be put more at
ease, because Martinez appeared to be concerned about her privacy. They
told Riley again that they were social workers and were conducting an
interview to determine the truth surrounding allegations of abuse or
improper treatment. Martinez told Riley that many of the questions that
they had to ask were personal and some sexual. Riley got nervous.
However, it was just talking, so it could be embarrassing, but not that
bad. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that the questions will get
more personal as they go along. If there is anything that she does not
understand, she needs to ask Martinez for an explanation or
demonstration. Riley agreed. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez set that up
from the beginning. Ask for a demonstration, she knew that she was
going to have Riley demonstrate sexual acts on her, Banes, Harris, and
Kline. Riley, sweet cute adorable, Riley had no idea what had just
started. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Banes that Martinez would ask
most of the questions, but that if Banes had a follow up question or
needed to interject a quick question she could. She also told Banes
that she would need to take careful notes and some pictures, of
injuries. Riley knew she had no injuries so that was not an issue.
Banes agreed. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked
Riley to describe her basic life up to that point in quick summary.
Riley had been born in ******** Canada. She was raised by her mother
and father. She had a good childhood with no issues. They resided in
the same house, until Riley reached age 14. Her parents rarely argued
and she had friends. When she was 4 her sister Jennifer was born.
Jennifer was the baby, but her parents did not play favorites and the
family got along just fine. When she was 6 her sister Kim was born.
Jennifer was not that baby anymore and was replaced by Kim. Kim was a
good baby sister. Jennifer was a little jealous sometimes, but mostly
they all got along really good. Jennifer was closet in age with Riley,
so they did everything together. <br> &nbsp; <br> At age 14, Riley’s
life was destroyed. Her father, Glenn, was taking Jennifer to a dental
appointment. It was 4 o’clock in the afternoon. Glenn had a green
light. He proceeded through the intersection. A drunk woman, ran the
red light. She hit Glenn at approximately 120 kilometers per hour. I am
reasonably sure that Glenn and Jennifer never even knew they were hit,
both were killed instantly. The woman was killed as well, but not as
quickly. She died at the hospital. She had no insurance and Glenn only
had liability insurance. Glenn thankfully had life insurance, but only
$100,000 worth. That lasted Dawn about a year and a half. She sold the
house, but they owed almost as much as it was worth. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Riley told Martinez that her sister Jennifer and her father were killed
in a car crash. That left her and Kim with just her mother. They got
along, but they were not happy. Her mother met Mike, me, her
step-father and started to get better. Riley told Martinez that she is
still upset about losing her father and misses her sister Jennifer. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez is supposed to be a social worker to help children. I cried
when Dawn first told me what had happened to her ex-husband and middle
daughter. But not Martinez, she was not phased. She just kept on going.
Even though that tragedy clearly explains her absences, her delayed
puberty, and modesty, Martinez just kept on going and would later
report, well I’ll get to that. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez changed the
subject and asked how Riley liked school. Riley said that it was ok and
that she liked her teachers and was getting good grades. Martinez asked
Riley if she had any close friends at school. Riley named a couple of
girls Monica and Lisa. Banes asked for their last names. Monica *******
and Lisa ******. Martinez asked Riley whether she had ever been over to
either of their houses. Riley told her, yes. Martinez told Banes to get
the address for them on another visit. Martinez asked whether Lisa or
Monica had ever been to her house. Riley said, yes. Martinez told Banes
that depending on the information they obtain, they may need to
interview Monica and Lisa. <br> &nbsp; <br> At that point, Martinez
had every intention of interviewing Monica and Lisa and doing whatever
she could to prove that I had somehow either touched them or fantasized
about touching them. In Martinez mind, even fantasy could lead to
illegal touching and needed to be addressed. That is straight from her
report. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley if she had any
boyfriends. Riley told her yes, but not outside of school. They just
talk in school and text sometimes. Martinez nodded that she understood.
Martinez asked Riley if she was sexually involved with any boys at
school. Riley made a disgusted face and said no. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Riley if was sexually involved with any girls at school.
Riley made an even more disgusted face and said, no of course not.
Martinez said some girls like girls. Riley said that that is fine, but
she likes boys, but is not ready to do anything. Martinez asked Riley
if she was a virgin, she said, yes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked
Riley what her relationship was with Rebecca, my ex-wife. She said
none. Rebecca had dropped off Brandon and Brianna a couple of time. She
told her that usually her dad, me, would pick them up at Rebecca’s
house, so Riley did not even see her. Rebecca has never come inside
Riley’s house. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley about her
relationship with her mother. She told her that they get along fine,
but are not close. Riley opened up and revealed that she blames her
mother partially for the car accident. If her mother had taken Jennifer
to the dentist, they would have gone a completely different route and
not had the accident. Martinez told Riley that some women just don’t
think all their actions through. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley
about her relationship with her step-father, me. Riley said that I am
very kind and treat her nicely. I buy her things and treat her the same
as all the other kids. Martinez asked whether I compliment her on her
body or face. She said, sometimes. Martinez looked at Banes. Martinez
asked her why only sometimes. What is different those times? Are you
wearing a swimsuit? Riley said, no. She told her that we just don’t
talk like that. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley whether her
mother compliments her. She said, yes. She said, mom always tells me
I’m pretty. Martinez asked Riley if she hugs and kisses her mother. She
said they hug but not kiss. Riley said she does not like to kiss.
Martinez looked at Banes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley
whether she hugs and kisses her step-father. She said she sometimes
hugs, but no kisses. Martinez asked, even on the cheek? Riley said, no.
What about your sisters and brother. Riley said sometimes dad and mom
will hug and kiss them on the cheek. Martinez said never ever on the
lips? Riley said, maybe sometimes. Martinez looked at Banes. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Riley why she does not fully change for gym class. Riley
asked, how did you know? Martinez told Riley that she is a social
worker and has a lot of information. She told Riley that Brianna and
Kim had already been interviewed and that she knows everything that her
step-father is doing to them and to her. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez was
totally lying. Kim, Brandon, and Brianna were being interviewed at the
same time. Martinez had not spoken to anyone. She had no idea what any
of them had said. She was just trying to trick and set up Riley, so she
would give answers that Martinez expected or wanted. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley, I am correct about the fact that you only change
down to you underwear in gym right? Riley said, yes. I am correct that
you step-father has seen you in your underwear correct? Riley said,
yes. Martinez asked Riley again, why do you only change to your
underwear? Riley said she does not want anyone to ever see her naked.
Riley said she does not know why, but she is just completely shy and
cannot let anyone, even her sister or mother see her naked. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley that it was just fine that she was shy. Martinez
then told her that it was normal and her private parts were her own and
she could keep them private. Riley was put at ease. <br> &nbsp; <br>
What a fucking mind game. Martinez knew she was going to have Riley
fully naked within the next few minutes. But she let Riley think that
the matter was closed and they were moving on with the interview and a
different subject. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley
whether her step-father has ever yelled at her or hit her. She said,
no. Martinez asked how she is punished. Riley said that she was not.
Martinez asked her, so you have never in the time you have lived with
your step-father ever done anything wrong. Riley thought. Riley said,
yes she has. She told Martinez that she has argued with Brandon and
Brianna over privacy and her stuff. Brandon walked in on her when she
was in the bathroom brushing her teeth. She was wearing a towel, but
she was still shy. She yelled at him and called him a troll. Riley told
Martinez that her step-father told her not to be so modest, lock the
door, and not to call Brandon a troll. Martinez confirmed, so your
step-father told you not to be so modest with your body. Riley said,
yes. Martinez looked at Banes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley
that they needed to check to see if she had any injuries, bruises,
cuts, scars, or tattoos. Martinez told Riley to take off her clothes
just like she does in gym class, just to her underwear. Riley noted
that the window blinds were open and anyone walking could see her.
However, in the 10 minutes that they had been in the room, no one had
walked by, so she started to take off her shoes and socks. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley to hand her clothes to Banes. Banes took the shoes
and socks and set them on the far table. Riley took off her long sleeve
button up shirt and handed it to Banes. Martinez told her to check the
seams and pockets. Banes searched the shirt and set it on the table.
Martinez told Riley to take off her pants. Riley did. She handed her
heavy oversized jeans to Banes. Banes checked the pockets and the
seams. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley to stand straight with her
arms down at her sides. She told her that Banes would need to take
several pictures. Riley stood straight up, hands at her sides, in only
her white cotton underwear. She was wearing a white cotton bra and
jockey full size underwear, not panties. Banes took a picture. Riley
smiled as the picture was taken. Martinez told Banes to take another
picture, but this time for Riley not to smile. Riley looked scared and
upset, her actual emotion at the time, in that photo. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley to turn around and face away. Banes took a picture
of Riley from behind. Martinez told Riley to place her feet shoulder
length apart. Riley did. Banes took another photo. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Riley if she knew the definition of the word kiss. Riley
thought for a second and said, it is when two people touch lips
together. Martinez told Riley that that is the correct definition, but
that she had only asked Riley a yes or no question, not for the
definition itself. Martinez admonished Riley to be truthful and pay
attention and only answer the question asked and not anticipate. Riley
got more nervous. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked the question again,
do you know the definition of the word kiss? Riley said, yes. Martinez
smiled and told her that she is very smart and doing well. Martinez
told her that in addition to answering questions, Riley will have to
cooperate with demonstrations and some picture posing. Martinez
reminded Riley that she had already done a good job posing for 3 photos
already. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked, Riley do you know the
definition of French kissing? Riley said, yes. Martinez asked what is
the definition of French kissing? Riley said, it is kissing with the
tongue. Martinez told Riley that that was close but there was more to
it. Martinez told Riley to demonstrate. Riley looked at her like how
and, no. Martinez told Riley that it was very important to either
exonerate or convict her step-father of the allegations. She told
Riley, if your step-father is abusing you, or your sisters or brother,
they need to know so that he can go to prison and get treatment. If he
is not and is innocent, they all need to fully cooperate so that her
step-father is not sent to prison for life for something he did not do.
<br> Martinez asked Riley, do you want your step-father to go to prison
for life? Riley said, no. Would it hurt you, Kim, and your mother if
you lost your new father. Riley said yes. Martinez told Riley that
Riley is determining what happens. If Riley does not cooperate,
Martinez will write a report based on the allegations and not have
anyone to say that the allegations are false. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez added that if her step-father goes to prison, Riley will
likely end up in a juvenile facility and not with her mother. Martinez
said that if her step-father abused her, than according to the law, her
mother placed Riley in the position to be abused and failed to stop it.
Riley was about to cry. Martinez said that Riley must demonstrate that
she understands all of the questions and is giving truthful answers, or
she could get in trouble for lying or obstructing. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Riley was now crying a little. Martinez told her to straighten up and
wipe the tear and keep going. Martinez asked Riley to demonstrate a
French kiss. Riley, still standing about 5 feet away from Martinez,
opened her mouth and started to stick out her tongue and moved it
around like she was French kissing the air. Martinez said that was
perfect. She told Riley to keep doing that as Banes took about 5
pictures from all angles. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley saw a person walk by
in the hall. They walked fast and did not appear to notice her.
Martinez and Banes did not appear to notice. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez
asked Riley if she knew what it was to be flirty and sexy. Riley said,
yes. Martinez asked Riley to be as flirty and sexy as she could. Riley
put on hand on her hip and the other in her hair and started flipping
her hair and wiggling her hips and making smile, wink, air kisses.
Martinez told her to just keep going and doing that as Banes took like
10 or 15 pictures from all angles. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told
Riley to keep being flirty. Riley was so embarrassed having to pose
like that, but she was terrified of Martinez and knew she had to do it.
Martinez told Riley to move her hands from her hip and head to cupping
under her bra. Martinez told her to be flirty with her boobs. Riley
did. Riley was pushing up on her boobs turning her chest side to side
to aim each boob at Banes and her camera. Riley was also smiling and
making the same faces. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that she
was doing good. Martinez told Riley to move her hands to the tops of
her inner thigh and to focus the flirting on her genitals. Riley looked
at Martinez wanting to scream, but she gave a fake smile and moved her
hands down. She was gyrating her genitals aiming it at Banes camera. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley that she was doing great and that they were almost
done. Martinez showed Riley the manual for the interviews in phase 2.
The manual was clear they needed at least 10 pictures of the victim
fully nude from all angles. Martinez pretended as though she had never
seen that before. Martinez asked Banes, did you know about that? Banes
said that she was new and had never done a phase 2 interview. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley that if it was not policy and the law, she would
end the interview and send Riley back to class. But it is in the manual
so they needed to proceed. Riley protested that she could not get
naked. Martinez told her to do it for her mother and step-father.
Martinez told Riley to just close her eyes and pretend that she is at
home in her shower alone. Martinez promised not to say anything and
that they would just take the pictures and let her dress. <br> &nbsp; <br>
That was a lie. Of course Martinez report does not say that. It does
indicate that Riley was overly modesty due to prior abuse and possible
repressed memories of abuse. The report certainly says that. But it
does not say that they tricked Riley into getting undressed and doing
sex acts with them. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley closed her eyes and started
to take off the bra. Martinez was watching and waiting for Riley to
hand it to her. Riley handed Martinez the bra. Martinez handed it to
Banes. Riley could hear a bag opening, but paid no attention to it.
Martinez told Riley that she was halfway there. Just the underwear
left. Riley took off the underwear and handed them to Martinez. Riley
had her eyes closed so she could not be sure, but she thought she heard
either Martinez or Banes sniff the underwear. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley to stay still, eyes closed, and hands at her sides.
Banes started to take pictures. Martinez made a call, Riley heard it.
Martinez just said come to the conference room. Riley kept her eyes
shut. Banes was still clicking away. <br> &nbsp; <br> Less than a
minute after the phone call, Riley heard the conference room door open.
Riley peeked. It was Officer Harris. Harris was smiling and Martinez
handed her a plastic bag and told her to take it to the car. Riley did
not know what it was, at that time. Harris took the bag, but continued
staring at Riley naked in the center of the room. Riley closed her eyes
and started to count down from 60. She was sure it would all be over in
less than a minute. <br> &nbsp; <br> Harris left and the door closed,
but Riley could now hear people in the hall. She lost count. Riley
opened her eyes and saw teachers going into the lunch room and a few of
them clearly noticed her. She saw her gym teacher stop and stare for a
second and two other teachers, one of them a man. Riley opened her
eyes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that she needed to stay
still for a few more standing photos before the flirty ones. Riley
told, asked, Martinez, that she thought it was just a few standing
photos. Martinez told her that the photo list for phase 2 continued on
the next page. Martinez told Riley they were only about halfway through
with the interview. Riley was so upset. She almost fainted. Martinez
told her to be a good girl and stop acting like a baby. She told her
that Kim had done just fine. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley though about her
little sister having to go through all of the same pictures and
interview. She felt bad but it helped her be stronger. But she
remembered she was naked in a windowed room and 3 teachers just saw
her. It took all of her strength not to cover her boobs and genitals
with her hands. <br> &nbsp; <br> The man teacher exited the lunch room
and looked directly at Riley again. He walked down the hallway. While
the door was open Riley could see other teachers in the lunch room and
they were looking at her and clearly talking about what was happening. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley to demonstrate the French kiss again. Riley, this
time standing fully naked, began tongue kissing and making out with the
air. Banes took pictures from all angles. This time not just 5. She
went all around Riley and even got low so that she was looking up from
Riley’s genitals for the picture of Riley tongue kissing the air. <br> &nbsp; <br>
After about 15 or 20 pictures, Martinez told Riley to put one hand on
her hip and the other on her head and be super flirty like before.
Riley changed hand position. Riley was now wiggling her hips, turning
her head, flipping her hair, and smile, tongue show, and air kiss. All
to look as flirty as Martinez required her to do, under threat of an
obstruction charge. <br> &nbsp; <br> There was a knock at the door.
Martinez, without even looking to see who it was said, come in. De Walt
entered the room. Riley saw De Walt and wanted to cover and run and
scream, but Martinez gave her a stern look and told her to keep being a
flirty girl. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley had to shake her hips, shake her
head, look side to side, smile and air kiss, while looking at Martinez,
De Walt and Banes. Banes had told Riley just to keep being flirty
toward Martinez and not to look at the camera, unless it was directly
in front of her. Banes wanted shots from all angels and many with Riley
looking in a direction other than the camera. Banes was taking up close
shots of all body parts from side and upward angles. <br> &nbsp; <br>
De Walt asked Martinez how she was doing. Martinez told her that they
were alright, but a new policy required more revealing photos to give
the court more information. She was lying. De Walt had seen full
interviews done by Martinez for the last 8 years. De Walt asked whether
Martinez wanted the blinds down. Martinez told her no. They do not
operate in secret and they did not want any confusion as to what was
taking place in the room. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez knew that she had
full license to do whatever she wanted. If she wanted the room on
display, it would be on display. De Walt kept her shock to herself. De
Walt told Martinez that she just wanted to make sure she had everything
and that if she had wanted the blinds closed, De Walt would be happy to
do it for her. Martinez thanked her and said she was fine. Martinez,
then added, did you get the class schedules that I told you I needed.
De Walt looked at Riley and got the message. De Walt understood that if
she interrupted again, the next photo session would be with her
daughter Jessica. She told Martinez that schedules would be available
for her to take when they left. De Walt smiled and left. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley to switch positions and flirt with her boobs. Riley
moved her and to press her edge of her palm facing up pushing up her
boobs and pointing each one at Martinez, while Banes took pictures.
Martinez told Riley that she was doing great and was a good photo
model. <br> &nbsp; <br> After 20 pictures, Martinez told Riley to be
really flirty with her genitals. Riley had no choice but to move her
hands down to her legs and open up a triangle with her hands and push
her genitals out toward Martinez and gyrate her hips and make loving
kissy faces. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that she was doing a
great job and that she was showing that the was cooperating. Martinez
asked Riley if she had ever French kissed any adult. Riley said, no.
Martinez told Riley that she answered to quickly without even thinking.
She asked Riley again, is it possible that at any time you French
kissed an adult. Riley said, no. Martinez told Riley that she needed to
think harder and remember. Riley again said no. Martinez told Riley
that she may be correct, or she may be repressing a memory. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley that the only way to be sure was to have Riley kiss
Martinez and see if it would stir a repressed memory. If it did not,
then either more work needs to be done to restore the memory, or Riley
is correct that she has not French kissed an adult. Riley said she was
sure. Martinez told her it does not matter whether she is sure, the
policy requires that an attempt me made, if there is no memory. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
What a fucking set up. Basically Martinez told Riley you will either
confirm that you French kissed your step-father or you will French kiss
me. That is a biased investigation technique. The easiest thing for
Riley to do was to say, oh yes I remember now. But she did not. Oh, and
you will see in a minute that remembering does not get you out of it
either. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley to demonstrate a French
kiss on her. She told Riley not to stop kissing unless she is told or
remembers something. Riley was looking at this old hag and being
required to kiss her. Those were Riley’s words based on Martinez
behavior neither Riley nor I believe that anyone of any age is a hag.
Please do not be offended if you are a beautiful woman over 50. Riley
knew she had to do it. She was repulsed and shanking. She closed her
eyes and opened her mouth. Martinez moved in closer and opened her
mouth. The two connected and Riley had her tongue in Martinez’ mouth
and Martinez had her tongue in Riley’s mouth. Banes began taking
pictures from all angles. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez opened her eyes. I
bet she likes to kiss with eyes open to see the girls. She pulled back
and paused. Riley thought she was done. Martinez asked her if she
remember anything. Riley said, no. Martinez told her they needed to
keep going, but this time Riley needed to have her eyes open. She told
her that she will prompt her with a pinch if she closes her eyes. They
moved in to kiss again. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez was moving her
tongue all around exploring Riley’s mouth and Riley had her tongue in
Martinez mouth and was just trying to avoid gagging. Martinez pinched
her and made a noise to remind Riley to open her eyes. Riley had to
look directly into Martinez’ eyes during the kissing. Banes continued
to take pictures capturing all angles and the open eyes. After about 3
min and 30 pictures, Martinez broke the embrace. Martinez looked at
Banes and told her that nobody could say they didn’t do everything to
try to stir any repressed memories. Banes smiled and agreed. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Riley if any adult had ever licked or sucked on her
boobs. Riley said no. Martinez went over the same dialogue about
repression and memories. Riley said that she understood now about
repressed memories and what they were trying to do. Riley knew that no
matter what, unless she lies and falsely accused me, she was going to
have Martinez suck on her tiny boobs. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez had
Riley stand with her hands behind Martinez’ head and Martinez buried
her face in Riley’s chest. Martinez licked each nipple and sucked on
each mini breast for at least a minute, as Banes photographed. After it
was over, Riley told her that it did not stir a memory. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked if any adult had ever licked or sucked on her pussy.
Yes, Martinez used the word pussy in that question. Riley said, no.
Martinez asked her to be sure. Riley said that she was sure. Riley
asked Martinez do we have to do a check for repressed memory on that.
Martinez said, yes. Martinez asked Riley whether she was afraid that
she would remember her mother or step-father doing it to her and that
that was why she was afraid to do it. Riley said, no. Then Martinez
told her there is absolutely no harm in trying. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez had Riley stand in front of her with her hands at her sides
and legs spread apart. Martinez got on her knees directly in front of
Riley’s genitals. Riley has hair on her vagina, but it is very light
blonde and she does not have very much. Martinez stuck out her tongue
and began licking Riley’s pussy. Banes started taking pictures. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez was licking all over Riley’s pussy in the front, as Banes was
moving around them taking pictures. Banes told Riley to open her eyes
and look down at Martinez. Martinez opened her eyes and looked up at
Riley. The two locked eyes. Banes told Riley to hold that look. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez was spreading Riley open more and moving more under her legs.
Martinez was licking Riley in the middle of her pussy headed back
toward her asshole. Martinez kept moving and licking Riley’s pussy now
from the rear and she was licking the pussy and Riley’s asshole, anus.
Riley said, Ms. Martinez. She wanted her to stop. She was so grossed
out. Martinez was now sticking her tongue in and out of her asshole.
Martinez said, Riley does this bring back a memory? Riley said, no.
Martinez told her to just be quiet and relax and try to remember. After
about 5 min and 30 photos, Martinez stopped licking. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez then, without Banes taking any pictures of it, stuck her
finger into Riley’s vagina and moved it around hard. Riley bucked and
wriggled. Martinez pulled out her finger and there was a little blood.
Martinez got up off the floor. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked again,
Riley has any adult ever licked or sucked her like that. Riley said no.
Martinez asked if anyone had ever put their penis or finger in her
pussy. Riley told her, no. Martinez told her that based on the response
of her pussy, she was not sure that was the truth. <br> &nbsp; <br>
That is crap, just like Brandon’s erection, just because Riley got a
little wet with all that fear, anxiety, and stimulation, so what. It
does not prove anything. The judge told me at the hearing, it does not
prove anything, but it is additional evidence to combine with other
evidence “a brick is not a wall.” You need a lot of bricks to make the
wall. What about the finger. I am sure Martinez broke Riley’s hymen.
When the did the medical exam later they confronted Riley about being a
virgin with a broken hymen, well fuck your social worker broke it. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Riley that they have determined that it was possible that
someone had performed sexual acts on her, but that it would need
further evidence from other sources. However, they needed to confirm
that no one had forced her to perform sexual act on them. There was
usually no evidence of this, because it only involved the mouth and no
injury. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley whether she had seen her
mother fully naked. Riley said, yes. Martinez called Harris on the
phone and asked her to come to the conference room. Again remember
Riley is still standing in the conference room naked. People are moving
in the hallway. <br> &nbsp; <br> Harris came into the room. Martinez
told Harris to get undressed. Riley was thinking why? Riley asked
Martinez whether she could get dressed. Martinez smirked and said into
what. Riley looked around, her clothes were gone. Riley remembered the
bag. Harris took her clothes. Her clothes were gone! Now she could not
dress. <br> &nbsp; <br> Harris was taking off her uniform. She took
off her duty belt and unzipped her shirt. She took off her boots and
socks. She took off her shirt and pants. She was wearing boxer shorts
for underwear. She had on a tight t-shirt and no bra. Riley saw that
Harris was totally fat and disgusting. Riley’s words, but based on
Harris personally. She had man boobs and a gut and her pussy was
covered in hair. But her legs were shaved and so were her armpits. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez told Harris to stand still with her arms to her sides. Riley
thought, oh brother is she going to spend the next 15 min taking all
the same photos. Banes actually only took one quick photo of Harris.
Standing naked. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez got undressed. She took of
her shoes and ankle socks. She slipped off her dress. She took of her
bra, which did not fit. Martinez looked like she had B-cup breasts that
had all the stuffing removed. They were just floppy sagging empty dog
ears that hung down. Martinez took off her panties, but even before
they came off, Riley could see all the hair coming out of the sides.
Martinez was hairy. She also had hair in her armpits. She also had an
appendix removal scar and some other scars on her arms and body. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez went into the middle of the room and Banes took one photo of
her standing naked, with her arms to the sides. She had a frumpy
expression and looked upset in the photo. Believe me no man would ever
be attracted to Martinez. I’ll get to it later, but for now know that I
did see all of the photos. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley was looking at
Harris naked and Martinez naked and they were both disgusting. Martinez
told Harris to sit next to her on the sofa. Harris did. Riley was
looking at Martinez and her hairy pussy and sagging tits. Riley knew
what was coming and did not want to do it. Martinez asked Riley if she
had ever sucked on an adult breast. Riley said, no. Martinez told her
that she was lying. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told her that Riley
breast fed as a child and did suck on an adult breast. Riley said well
I did not think of that. Martinez told Riley that the questions are
straight forward and she needed to answer honestly. It was not up to
Riley to try to read into the question. Riley changed her answer. She
said, yes. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked Riley whether her mother’s
nipples were more like Harris’ or Martinez’? Riley said well, in
between. Martinez told Harris that is what she figured. Martinez told
Riley to come to the sofa and suck on Harris’ nipple for one minute
then to switch and suck on Martinez nipple. She added that Riley would
go and for the between breasts for a couple minutes. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Riley went over to the sofa and kneeled in front of Harris. Harris
smiled and opened her arms to allow Riley access to her breasts. Riley
started to suck on the right breast and nurse. She was sucking for
about 30 seconds and then Martinez told her to switch. Riley moved over
to Martinez and started to suck on her left empty breast. She chewed
and sucked on it for about 30 seconds, when Martinez called for her to
switch. That back and forth lasted for 4 minutes. Banes took pictures
from all angles. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that they were
almost done with Harris. Not almost done, just almost done with Harris.
Martinez asked Riley whether her step-father had ever forced her to
perform oral sex on her mother or any other woman. Riley said, no.
Martinez asked whether she was sure. Riley looked as Harris’ pussy and
then at Martinez’ old hairy pussy. She just blurted out, yes. Yes I
remember that. We don’t have to demonstrate. I remember he made me do
that. <br> &nbsp; <br> I do not blame Riley. She did what she had to.
Do you blame people in foreign prisons for talking in interrogation.
This was an interrogation and abuse. I don’t blame her at all. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez looked at Banes. Martinez then asked Riley if her step-father
had ever made her touch or lick his penis. Riley said yes. Banes was
documenting everything. Banes called De Walt and asked her to have
Kline come to the conference room. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez asked
Riley who her step-father had forced her to perform oral sex on? Riley
said just a friend of his I don’t know her name and never saw her
again. Martinez asked her what she had to do? Riley said, you know lick
and kiss her pussy. Martinez tried to trick Riley. She asked Riley, is
that all you had to do? He did not make you kiss her on the mouth or
suck on her boobs? Riley said no. She knew she had to stick to her
answer. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez, instead of documenting the obvious
that Riley was lying to avoid having to recall a suppressed memory by
demonstration, she chose to document that Riley was lying about not
having to suck on breast and French kissing with other women. She just
chose to make a finding based on her bias and one that would not show
that her investigation technique was flawed and lead to false
statements. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley was sure that if she said that she
remembered it was done. Wrong. Martinez told her to show her using
Harris exactly what her step-father had made her do. Riley realized
there really was no way to avoid the sex demonstration. Riley
hesitated. Martinez prodded her. She said she needed Riley to lick and
kiss Harris’ pussy just as she has done before. Martinez told her it
was not like the other demonstrations performing acts for the first
time. She told Riley just do what you did last time. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Riley got on her knees and stuck out her tongue. She started to lick
and kiss Harris’s hairy pussy. Harris put her hands on Riley’s head and
started to moan. Banes was taking pictures. Riley was licking and
kissing the lips of Harris’ pussy. Harris told Riley she was such a
good sex pussy licker. Martinez told Harris to be quiet. Then she asked
Riley, did the woman say things like that to you when you licked. Riley
said, yes. Martinez told Harris that she could say what she wanted and
encouraged Riley to keep licking. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley licked Harris
for about 5 minutes. Harris almost orgasmed. I know, I don’t really
know that, but I bet its true. Martinez told her to stop. She then told
Harris to get dressed. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that she
would need to demonstrate just one more time. The manual required that
the demonstration be on the social worker. Martinez apologized for not
seeing that part earlier. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley to lick
and kiss her pussy just like she did with Harris. She needs to be able
to testify at the court as to what the woman felt. Harris could not do
that. Riley stuck out her tongue and started to lick all over Martinez’
hairy pussy. Martinez had Riley’s head in her hands and called her a
sexy pussy licker. She then confirmed with Riley that the woman had
used language like that. <br> &nbsp; <br> Riley kept licking all over
Martinez pussy and Martinez was moaning and opening her pussy up and
pulling up her legs to reveal more of the middle and bottom of the
pussy. Riley was licking all over. Martinez pulled back enough that her
hairy asshole was visible and available. She told Riley to lick it.
Riley said I did not do that before. Martinez said you may not
remember. Just lick it. Riley was licking it. She was so afraid at this
point. She had lied about her step-father and was now licking a woman’s
asshole. This went on for about 5 more min. Banes photographed it all. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Kline was outside the door waiting. Riley was curled up on the floor
covering herself. Martinez was getting dressed. Martinez told Kline to
come in. When Kline was inside she told him to take off his uniform. <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br>
Kline took off his boots and his socks. The took off his duty belt,
which did not have a gun. Loser. He took off his shirt and undershirt.
He took of his pants and his underwear briefs. He was standing with his
cock and balls on display. Martinez had him stand in the middle of the
room for a picture. Banes took the photo. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez
told Riley that this was the last part. She promised. She reminded
Riley that her step-father had made her touch and kiss his penis.
Martinez just need to have a couple of photos showing exactly what she
was made to do. Riley got up from the floor. She wiped a tear from her
face and looked at Kline. He was a fat slob. Riley went over to Kline
and got on her knees. She held Kline’s penis in her hand and Banes took
a photo. Riley held Kline’s balls in her hand and Banes took a photo.
Riley put Kline’s penis in her mouth. Banes took a photo. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez asked Riley if she had to do anything else. Riley said, no.
Martinez told Kline to get dressed and leave. Martinez is a fucking man
hater. If it was not necessary to for the case, she never would have
let Kline have any contact with a girl. <br> &nbsp; <br> As Kline was
getting dressed, Martinez told Banes to take off her pants and panties.
Riley got confused. Riley wanted to get dressed, but her clothes were
gone. Banes got up and took off her shoes, pants, and underwear.
Martinez told Banes that, since she is new, but will soon be doing
interviews on her own, she needed to at least feel what it was like to
have a girl lick her. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Riley that she
has been a good brave girl and the courts will protect her. Martinez
asked Riley whether it would be alright to just give Banes a quick
lick. Just to help her in training and help her in this investigation.
Riley agreed, like she could really say no. Riley went over and gave
Banes a hug. Banes smiled. Banes told Riley, if she had not just had a
dick in her mouth, she would kiss her. Martinez laughed. Riley got on
her knees and licked Banes’ pussy 5 licks. Martinez told her that was
enough. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez told Banes to get dressed, go to De
Walt and get the schedules for Riley and Jessica, go to the car and
bring back Riley’s clothes. At this point the hallway was getting very
busy. Banes left the room and went to De Walt’s office. Martinez was
checking to make sure they had everything. Riley was just standing
there covering herself. The door to the conference room was open and
people were in the hallway going to the lunchroom and the other parts
of the office. <br> &nbsp; <br> Martinez again thanked Riley and told
her that the interview was over, but that the investigation was not.
Riley nodded. Riley asked about her clothes. Martinez told her that
Banes would be back in a while with the bag. Martinez said goodbye to
Riley and was about to walk out the door. Riley said, what about me.
Martinez told Riley that she was fine, she could wait in the room or
come to De Walt’s office for the clothes bag. <br> &nbsp; <br> That is
fucking crap. After all they did to this girl, now Martinez is about to
just leave her in a room naked and waiting hoping that her clothes will
be returned. That was totally unprofessional and obviously wrong. Of
course Martinez denied doing that at the hearing, but I believe Riley. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez turned off the light and was headed out, she looked back at
Riley and said, are you coming? Riley was naked. She was terrified,
mortified, and well, horrified. Riley covered her boobs with her arm
and her genitals with her hand and followed closely behind Martinez.
They walked down the hallway and teachers, clerical staff, and De Walt
saw Riley walking naked. <br> &nbsp; <br> They got to the reception
area and Riley was covering. De Walt came right out and asked why Riley
was still naked in the office area. Martinez told her that they had to
take her clothes and that Riley was impatient and would not wait. De
Walt just smiled at Martinez and laughed. De Walt told Martinez, you
know teens, they are impatient. De Walt told Riley to wait in her
office and she would bring in her clothes. Riley scurried into De
Walt’s office still covering her breasts and genitals, but not covering
her rear end as she was running away. De Walt, just to make Martinez
comfortable, looked at Riley as she scurried and told Martinez that
Riley looked so cute and had a cute bottom. Martinez smiled. <br> &nbsp; <br>
De Walt told Martinez that she got the schedules for Jessica and Riley.
She reviewed them, as she said that she would, and saw that they had no
classes in common. Martinez thanked De Walt and told her to ask Jessica
if she knows Riley ******** anyway. De Walt agreed to ask. <br> &nbsp; <br>
De Walt added that if Jessica did know Riley she would question her and
be happy to tell Martinez everything. Martinez asked De Walt, you mean
if she has information I should interview you instead of her? De Walt
said yes. Martinez said that would not be productive. De Walt told her,
yes it would you would be satisfied that you got everything you needed.
Martinez just smiled and told he just let me know if she knows her. <br> &nbsp; <br>
Martinez then told De Walk to look up the cum file information on
Monica ******* and Lisa ******. She said that they were friends of
Riley and may have been over at her house. De Walt told her that she
would get the information to her as soon as possible. De Walt went up
to Martinez and gave her a hug and said that Monica and Lisa would
probably have more information than Jessica. De Walt kissed Martinez on
the cheek, as close to the mouth as she could without kissing it.
Martinez said, alright don’t bother Jessica. <br> &nbsp; <br> Banes
came in with the bag with Riley’s clothes. De Walt took the clothes
from her and shook her hand. Martinez and Banes left. De Walt brought
Riley her clothes. Riley told her what happened and that she wanted to
crawl in a hole. <br>&nbsp;</p>
