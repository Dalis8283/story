<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">SYNOPSIS:
There&#8217;s a mystery at Grandma Ruth&#8217;s
farm and Anna finds herself right in the middle of it. Along the way
she finds
herself reluctantly exposed &amp; embarrassed and learns a lot
about herself
while trying to solve the mystery. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But
MOM!&#8221; I protested. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be serious!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Of
COURSE I&#8217;m serious dear. The change will do
you good.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;The
whole summer?! Why can&#8217;t I stay here with
you and enjoy the summer with my friends? It&#8217;s not like you are going
anywhere.
Why am I being punished?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom just sighed and shook her head. &#8220;Oh Anna,
stop being such a drama queen. You&#8217;re not being punished. I would have
thought
you would have jumped at the chance to spend some time on a farm.
Besides, you
haven&#8217;t seen your grandma in several years. She may not be around much
longer.
You&#8217;ll regret not spending more time with her after she&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">BUT
mom . . . all alone on that isolated old
farm with that old lady. Why, she doesn&#8217;t even have electricity. I
won&#8217;t be
able to use my smartphone or my computer! How will I update my Facebook
page?
This isn&#8217;t fair! Why can&#8217;t she come here and visit?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mom dropped the basket of laundry she was
carrying, marched across the room and took a firm grip on my chin.
&#8220;That&#8217;s
enough, young lady. You may be only 16 but that&#8217;s not too old to get an
old-fashioned spanking. Now you&#8217;re going to Grandma Ruth&#8217;s farm
tomorrow and
you&#8217;re going to like it. If I hear one more word out of you you&#8217;ll lose
your
precious smartphone, i-Pad AND your computer until you&#8217;re 18. Do I make
myself
clear young lady?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
was no use in arguing any further. My mom
had made the ultimate threat. There was no way I could jeopardize
losing my
electronic gadgets for two whole years! It wasn&#8217;t a bluff either. She
would
take away my things in a heartbeat as she was that strict. Once she had
drawn
the line on my behavior I knew better than to cross it. I would just
have to
make the best of it. But . . . the WHOLE SUMMER! UGH!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
following morning my mom loaded my suitcase
into the family car. She had packed my suitcase for me as she said I
wouldn&#8217;t
take the appropriate clothing for farm work and there was no way she
was coming
back out to bring me extra things. She said if it was left up to me I
would
only take useless junk that I couldn&#8217;t use anyway. After all, she was
raised on
that farm and I was too much of a spoiled city girl to look after my
own best
interests.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
spending almost the entire day driving we
finally arrived at the farm. What a dump! The wooden house looked like
it
hadn&#8217;t seen a coat of paint in years. There were critters running all
over the
place and I had no idea what was holding the rickety old barn up. Even
worse,
the place smelled like animal poo and it was hot! REALLY hot! I just
knew that
without air conditioning I would just die! Mom was right. I was a
spoiled
city-girl and I liked it that way! How in the world did Grandma live
out here
all by herself?</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I looked around as mom talked with Grandma
Ruth, all I could see was pasture and trees. Pasture grass and trees as
far as
the eye could see. There didn&#8217;t seem to be another house for miles. The
nearest
town was about 5 miles away and as we drove through it on the way over,
it
really wasn&#8217;t much of a town &#8211; only a gas station, a general store, a
hardware
store, and a tractor dealer. I guess shopping to pass the time would be
out of
the question. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
train of thought was interrupted as Grandma
called out, &#8220;There&#8217;s my little Katie! Oh, isn&#8217;t she adorable?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Grandma,
My name is Anna . . . not Katie.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Nonsense!
I&#8217;d know my 7-year old granddaughter
anywhere! Come here and give your Nana a big hug!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Grandma
. . . I&#8217;m not Katie and I certainly am
NOT just 7 years old. I&#8217;m 16 and in high school for Pete&#8217;s sakes!
What&#8217;s the
matter with you? Are you blind . . . &#8220;Just then, I spotted my mom
giving me a
stern look and I knew I was close to crossing the line. I relented and
submitted to a rib-crushing hug that almost took my breath away! For an
old
lady she still had a lot of strength. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Mom
and I spent about an hour sitting in the
shade on her wrap-around porch filling Grandma in on all the goings-on
since
the last time we visited. The entire time Grandma Ruth kept referring
to me as
Katie and the tone of her voice reflected her belief that she was
actually
talking to a 7-year old. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
she finally went inside I pleaded, &#8220;Mom . .
. she&#8217;s like all crazy and confused! You can&#8217;t leave me here with that
demented
old woman! She&#8217;s got that old timer&#8217;s disease or something. She needs
to be in
a home not living alone out here.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She
may be a little confused at times, I&#8217;ll
admit, but what senior citizen isn&#8217;t? She&#8217;s perfectly capable of taking
care of
herself and she manages her farm quite nicely. She may not live in a
fancy
house or have a lot of money but she still takes care of this place
just fine
and she&#8217;s well-liked by her neighbors in town. You aren&#8217;t in any danger
and if
you&#8217;re trying to get out of spending some quality time with my mother,
just
remember what I said.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Soon
afterwards mom got into her car and bid us
both &#8220;goodbye&#8221; before driving off down the dusty, dirt road leaving the
two of
us alone. Grandma had me help her in the kitchen and seemed surprised
that I
could do as much as I could &#8211; being only 7-years old. After trying to
correct
her for like 3 hours I finally gave up and just let her think what she
wanted.
Besides that glaringly obvious incorrect impression of who I was and
her
understanding of my age, Grandma Ruth seemed like the jolly and
pleasant person
I remembered her to be. Her house wasn&#8217;t though. It was sorely in need
of some
serious cleaning. If I was going to stay here for 3 months I was at
least going
to see to it that it was tidy and dust-free. Besides, there wasn&#8217;t much
else to
do but clean and do chores as there was no TV or anything that even
remotely
resembled entertainment.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That
night it was so hot, sweat was literally
pouring off of me as I tried to sleep. The windows were open in my
bedroom but
there was no breeze and the air was still and humid. I slept in my
T-shirt
instead of my usual night attire and shoved the bed linen to the floor.
That at
least helped keep me cool. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
next few days, in order to have something to
do, I learned to do the farm chores &#8211; feeding the livestock, cleaning
out the
barn. I even got around to tidying up Grandma&#8217;s house a bit. It was fun
but
ever so hard. Much to my regret all the clothes my mother had packed
for me
were thick and heavy &#8211; things like flannel shirts and denim jeans. I
guess she
figured they would protect me from getting hurt around the farm. That
may have
been true but in this heat I would die from heat stroke if I tried to
wear
those things! I found myself treasuring the few things that were of
light
material like the two T-shirts and the one pair of shorts that she did
manage
to pack. At the end of each day I was quite tired and that helped me
sleep at
night despite my discomfort over the lack of air conditioning. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally
one morning Grandma could sense that I
was exhausted. &#8220;Katie dear, why don&#8217;t you skip the chores for today and
go down
to the lake and cool off,&#8221; Grandma said with a smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be
a
scorcher today. Besides, it&#8217;s not good for such a young person to work
so
hard.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
wasn&#8217;t about to argue. She told me that there
was a lake a pretty good ways up the dirt road but that I could walk to
it
without any trouble. I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to swim a creepy old lake
as there
was no telling what kind of slimy creatures or snakes might lurk in the
murky
water. Still, it would be nice to do a little exploring so I agreed and
took
off across the pasture and then through the woods looking for that dirt
road
she had told me about. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
walked along for what seemed like forever
until I finally found it and began following it along. Suddenly I heard
voices
&#8211; teenagers! My spirits lifted immediately. At last, people my own age!
I
wondered if perhaps they lived close by and had access to a computer or
perhaps
some video games! I left the road and began following the sounds of
their
laughter and horseplay through the woods. A little voice kept telling
me to be
careful because after all I wasn&#8217;t sure sure who these people were so
as I got
closer I began to carefully crawl along staying out of sight. When the
voices sounded
as if they were really close by, I knelt beside a large bush and slowly
peeked up
my head over the branches.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
heart just about stopped! There before my
very eyes were at least 5 teenage boys and they were completely NAKED
as they
horsed around running in and out of the water!!! I had NEVER, EVER in
my entire
life seen a real live teenage boy naked! I was shocked and fascinated.
My heart
began to pound and I felt that familiar sensation between my legs which
I knew
to be from sexual arousal &#8211; the same feeling I had when I fingered
myself when
I was alone in my bedroom but this time I wasn&#8217;t even touching myself! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Being
careful not to make a sound lest I be
discovered I kept watching, hoping that one or the other of the boys
would once
again leave the cover of the lake and run towards shore so I could see
what I
knew I wasn&#8217;t supposed to be seeing! Eventually one cute boy did just
that as
he ran out of the water to retrieve a ball that they had been playing
with. At
first he ran away from me and all I could see was his pale butt cheeks
&#8211; and
what cute butt it was too! As he picked up the ball and ran back
towards the
lake, his penis came clearly into view and I was fascinated. In fact
over the
next several moments that scene repeated itself several times with
different
boys and I got to see all of them!! I was amazed as each one of them
was
different. I never realized that boys&#8217; packages came in so many
different
shapes and sizes! My heart was still racing as I took it all in. As
much as I
wanted to get closer or perhaps even join them, I dared not move a
muscle as I
was afraid of what might happen to me if they discovered that they were
being
watched by a girl. This was waaaaaay better than TV and the last thing
I wanted
to do was ruin it! No, I was content just to watch. Okay, if you want
to the
truth, I was too chicken to move. I was frozen with fear and emotion. I
don&#8217;t
think I could have moved even if I wanted to &#8211; a thought that made my
heart
pound all the harder as I wondered what I would do if they did actually
see me
and came in my direction! I don&#8217;t think I could have run away if I
tried. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All
too soon the boys had had enough and they
all got out of the water, dressed and then headed around the shore to
the
opposite side of the lake and disappeared into the woods. I stayed put
for some
time after I could no longer hear their voices just in case they came
back.
They didn&#8217;t and eventually I found the nerve to get up and make my way
back to
the dirt road that led to Grandma&#8217;s house. All I could think about on
my way
home was what I had seen! I tingled all over &#8211; especially &#8220;down there!&#8221;
</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
took care of &#8220;business&#8221; as I took my bath
later that evening. It was still so very warm that I only put on my
T-shirt and
panties as I sat in the front room talking with Granny. I was afraid
she would
object or say something to embarrass me but I guess she must have
thought it
was perfectly natural for a &#8220;7-year old&#8221; to dress that way at night
since
that&#8217;s what she thought I was &#8211; a 7-year old. One thing was for sure,
however,
and that was that I could NEVER get away with dressing like this at
home! I
felt so naughty and excited! It was as if I was getting away with
something. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mind was so worked up over what I had seen
that day that I could hardly get to sleep. When I did finally wake up
the next
morning I was still aroused. I decided to go down to breakfast dressed
just as
I was &#8211; T-shirt, no bra and pink panties. I wanted to prolong that
feeling for
just a little longer before having to get dressed. To my surprise,
Granny asked
me to go out to the chicken coop and see if there were any eggs as she
needed a
few more for the omelets she wanted to make. Before I knew what I was
doing I
found myself outside in basically my underwear!! It was awesome. It was
naughty
yet it felt so liberating and natural somehow. Yes, there were eggs and
I
gathered them up and put them in the bottom of my rolled up T-shirt so
they
wouldn&#8217;t break. What a rush!! Now my panties were completely exposed
and I was
outside! Why anyone could see me if they were out there somewhere and I
knew
from yesterday that, even though we were out in the boonies, teenage
boys
weren&#8217;t that far off!! I lingered around the chicken coop and barn for
as long
as I dared taking in all the strange sensations I was feeling and then
returned
to the house! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Did
you find any eggs, Katie?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
ma&#8217;am, I did. There were 5 in the nesting
boxes. I took them all.&#8221; As I held out my shirt to hand Granny the eggs
she
looked at me with a grin for a moment as if she knew what I was up to
but then
she returned to making breakfast and nothing more was said. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
we sat around the breakfast table talking
about things I realized that this was the first time in several days
that I was
actually happy and enjoying myself. Granny repeated herself a few times
as we
talked, almost as if she forgot that she had already told me that news
before,
but otherwise I enjoyed our meal and our morning chat for once. When
breakfast
was finished I began clearing the table. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8221;Katie,&#8221;
Granny said as she emerged with a
laundry basket. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to wash a few things this morning in the
wash tub
outside, I&#8217;ve got your other T-shirt and if you give me that one I&#8217;ll
wash it
too. Your stuff is pretty filthy. Just because you&#8217;re living on a farm
doesn&#8217;t
mean you have to look like you do all the time, you know.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Thanks
Granny, but this is the only other cotton
shirt I have. All the rest of my things are too heavy to wear in this
heat.
I&#8217;ll just keep it on for a while longer.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221;
she said as she grabbed the tail of
my shirt and began lifting over my head.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny!
I&#8217;m not wearing anything under my
shirt! I don&#8217;t have a bra on!&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Piffle!
7-year olds don&#8217;t need a bra anyway.
Now give me that shirt and stop all the whining.&#8221; With that, my shirt
disappeared into her laundry basket and Granny left to go outside
leaving me
standing at the kitchen sink topless and wearing only my pink panties.
I stood
there covering myself with my arms for several moments not quite
knowing what I
should do. I realized that despite the heat I should change into
something
else. After pondering things for a few moments I decided that I should
at least
finish clearing up and do the dishes.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Looking
out the window as I filled the sink with
cold water I saw granny at the old well lifting the handle of the metal
pitcher
pump to fill a large washtub. Such back-breaking working I thought.
Granny
should really see about getting electricity out here so she could use
an
electric washing machine instead of doing laundry by hand the
old-fashioned
way. I guess the main reason, like most households in the city that
want things
they don&#8217;t have, money was always the chief consideration. At her age I
suspected
she didn&#8217;t have much. I worked away cleaning the kitchen and soon
forgot about
my embarrassment at being topless. Oh I was aware of my state of
undress but I
wasn&#8217;t afraid anymore. In fact, I felt a bit aroused by the whole
thing. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Once
the kitchen was clean I decided to stay
inside &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t that brave to go out half-naked like I was &#8211; and
decided to
clean the rest of the house until my clothes were dry. There certainly
was
enough work to keep me busy for a while and that heat from the sun
would
certainly dry my things in no time &#8211; or so I thought.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Time
passed and I made a lot of progress dusting
and picking up. What a mess her place was. I kept imagining what I must
have
looked like as I bent over to clean things and pondering what my mom
would say
if she saw me like this. She&#8217;d kill me - that&#8217;s what she&#8217;d do. No doubt
about
that at all!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was in the back bedroom cleaning when Granny
called, &#8220;Katie . . . can you come here a minute?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Be
right there Granny,&#8221; I said as I finished
making my bed.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I came down the short hall and rounded the
corner into the front room there stood two women &#8211; one looked to be in
her
early thirties and the other just a little older. &#8220;GRANNY!!!&#8221; I
exclaimed
trying to cover myself. I couldn&#8217;t believe she did that to me &#8211; letting
me walk
out there topless in front of complete strangers!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny
took hold of my arm and pulled me closer.
&#8220;Ladies, this is my granddaughter, Katie. She will be staying with me
for the
entire summer. Isn&#8217;t she just the cutest thing?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
two girls just grimed a knowing smile in my
direction as they both looked me over. I was so embarrassed! I couldn&#8217;t
run and
I was mortified to be seen like this. No one had seen me naked since I
was a
little girl &#8211; oh wait &#8211; Granny thought I WAS a little girl. This was
all too
confusing!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
younger lady extended to her hand to shake
mine. &#8220;Pleased to me you Katie. I&#8217;ve heard so much about you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">There
was nothing I could do. I HAD to shake her
hand. Since Granny still had a hold of my left arm I had to uncover
myself to
return her handshake allowing both women to get a good view of my
boobs. &#8220;Um,
my name is actually Anna,&#8221; I said meekly trying to correct the
misimpression my
Grandmother had given them. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But
she likes to called Katie, isn&#8217;t that right
dear?&#8221; Granny added in a hurry.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I reluctantly replied seeing there
was no way I was going to win. What have I gotten myself into, I
wondered?</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
young woman smiled as she took my hand.
&#8220;Pleased to me you, Katie. I&#8217;m Trisha Hoffman. I&#8217;ve known your
Grandmother for
years. It&#8217;s so nice that she has such a wonderful girl to keep her
company for
the summer.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
the young woman was talking, I noticed her
eyes kept darting over my body as if she was devouring the sight before
her. It
made me feel very self-conscious and creepy. She kept hold of my hand
as she
prattled on about my Grandmother and how she often dropped by to check
on her. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have a wonderful time,&#8221;
the other woman spoke up and extended her hand in greeting. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Trisha&#8217;s
neighbor Madeleine, but people call me Miss Maddie. I own one of the
little
stores in town. You MUST come by sometime for a visit and meet the
family. My
Danny would love the company - always looking to meet new friends you
know. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny
let go of my arm as she gestured for me
to sit on the sofa. The three women sat down and talked about trivial
things
making polite conversation. As usual, Granny often repeated herself in
conversation but the guests seemed to pay it no mind. All I wanted to
do was
find a reason to leave so I could get out of the gaze of these people.
But
every time I tried to excuse myself and stood up to leave, Granny
pulled me
back down on the sofa and the women continued to talk. I must have been
sitting
among them half-naked like I was for at least a half an hour. During
that time
I would catch one or the other of our guests staring at me. When they
discovered I had noticed them looking at my body, they would politely
smile
that knowing little grin as if we were sharing some sort of personal
secret and
then they&#8217;d look away.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">At
first, I thought it was just because they
were enjoying the awkward situation and my body, but the more it
happened the
more I began to wonder if there was something else going on. I began to
wonder
if there really was some sort of secret about Granny or maybe something
about
this town that I didn&#8217;t know. The whole thing was creeping me out.
Still, there
was no denying my body&#8217;s response. My skin was electrified and was
tingling all
over just sitting there as I was wearing just my panties. Teenagers my
age just
didn&#8217;t DO these things. At least that&#8217;s how I had been raised. I felt
naughty.
The worst part was that, deep down however, I sort of liked it. I knew
it was
wrong but somehow it was thrilling nonetheless. It&#8217;s hard to explain.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
Ms. Hoffman was talking to Granny, Miss
Maddie asked me if I liked horses. She informed me that my Grandmother
had the
gentlest horse she had ever seen and that I should take him for a ride
sometime. When I explained I didn&#8217;t know much about horses, she rose to
her
feet, grabbed my hand and said, &#8220;Come on, Katie, I&#8217;ll show you
everything you
need to know.&#8221; She then turned to my Granny and Trisha, Ms. Hoffman
that is,
and added, &#8220;Ruth, we&#8217;ll be outside with Old Smokey. We&#8217;ll be back in a
little
bit.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">To
my surprise I found myself being escorted
outside once again only this time in just my pink panties!! No T-shirt
this
time to hide behind! I nervously looked around to see if anyone else
was about
as Maddie led me to the small paddock where a pretty red and white
horse was
standing there swatting flies with his tail. &#8220;Katie, meet Old Smokey.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;He&#8217;s
beautiful!. He looks rather, um, rather
dangerous though if you ask me,&#8221; I replied a bit apprehensively. I was
standing
there leaning against the wooden fence rail very much aware of how the
light
breeze was tickling my sensitive and completely unprotected nipples. As
I
looked down they were quite pointy &#8211; sticking out as if to draw
attention to my
breasts. I was afraid Maddie would notice and give me one of those
silly grins
of hers. I blushed at the thought of her noticing. As she talked on
about the
horse, I was still paying more attention to my surroundings than I was
to that
silly animal. I was SURE that at any minute some of those teenage boys
I saw at
the lake were going to come by and see me topless! After all, I never
did hear
those women come calling and was shocked to find them standing in
Granny&#8217;s
house! I just KNEW that one or more of those boys were about even
though I
couldn&#8217;t hear anything ominous and I would suddenly find them looking
at me!!
If that happened I would just die!! There was no place I could hide if
one of
them did appear as I was quite far away from the house and the barn.
This
paddock was much farther away from Granny&#8217;s porch than the chicken
coop. This
was not a good place to be when you&#8217;re only wearing panties!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Maddie
tapped me on my shoulder to get my
attention. &#8220;He&#8217;s called Old Smokey because your Grandmother has had him
for a
very long time and he&#8217;s as gentle as a newborn lamb. When he was just a
colt
she named him Smokey because that morning was very foggy. She raised
him and
trained him very well. In his day, he won many ribbons at the county
fair and
all the kids around here just loved him to death. He&#8217;s really great
with kids.
You&#8217;ve nothing to fear from this old fellow. Now that he&#8217;s getting on
in years
everyone just calls him Old Smokey. It suits him, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
guess so. But I could never ride something
that big. I&#8217;ve never ridden a horse in all my life. Why, I don&#8217;t even
know
where the brakes are!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Maddie
just laughed and grabbed a blanket and a
saddle from the barn and proceeded to show me how to saddle him
properly. When
she had finished she asked me if I thought I could do that on my own. I
lied,
and when I said I thought I could, she took everything off the horse
and made
me show her that I really could do it on my own. After a few tries I
got the
hang of it</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
kept pestering me to climb up on the saddle.
I thought of a hundred excuses why I couldn&#8217;t but she was persistent
and
eventually I gave in. I knew once I was on top of that thing I would be
even
more vulnerable and exposed than standing on the ground where I could
use the
horse for cover if I had to.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Don&#8217;t
you DARE let go of him,&#8221; I yelled in a
panic. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;ve
nothing to fear. Old Smokey has only one
speed &#8211; a slow walk. I don&#8217;t think he could run if he had to, sweetie.&#8221;
She
then opened the gate and led him around as I sat there as though I was
just
along for the ride. It was fun. Just between you and me all that
rocking back
and forth with the saddle rubbing my sweet spot made me very aroused
and exited
&#8211; way more than I already had been! Soon she gave me the reins and told
me what
to do and encouraged me to walk him about on my own. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Nervously
I finally got him to go and before
long I was having the time of my life. I had never ridden a horse
before and
this was fun &#8211; fun in more ways than I wanted Maddie to know about,
anyway! I
was quite wet and I found myself deliberately rocking my hips way more
than I
needed to as Smokey walked along just to heighten the sensation between
my
legs! I was afraid I was going to really embarrass myself if I kept on
riding
as I could feel that familiar pressure building &#8220;down there&#8221; and I knew
that I
was about to climax if I didn&#8217;t quit soon. I couldn&#8217;t believe I was
sitting
there outside so high up in the saddle where anyone could see me and of
course
exposing my boobs to this total stranger while secretly trying to
pleasure
myself. What a hell of a ride!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
finally stopped Smokey before I got too
carried away. The horse stood there for a moment and then suddenly
lowered his
head to the ground to resume eating grass, pulling the reins right out
of my
hand! They ended up on the ground and I couldn&#8217;t reach the reins to get
him to
go again no matter how far leaned forward in the saddle. I was stuck.
Just then
I heard a loud bang like a car door slamming shut. I squealed and
hurriedly
brought both arms up to cover my chest and tried to slouch down low
making
myself into a little ball as I nervously looked this way and that
trying to see
what was going on behind me! My heart was literally pounding in my
chest! &#8220;Oh
Gawd . . . they&#8217;re here!&#8221; I thought to myself. I just KNEW those boys
were
here!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Maddie
just stood there behind me about ten
yards away just laughing at me. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, sweetie? Don&#8217;t tell
me
you&#8217;re shy?&#8221; I was about to snap back angrily at her when I noticed my
Granny
and Trisha standing at the car.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We;ve
got to go Maddie,&#8221; Ms. Hoffman yelled
across the pasture from the driver&#8217;s side window. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was never so relieved in all my life! It was
only Granny. Maddie turned to walk away saying as she did so, &#8220;So long,
kiddo.
Have fun with Old Smokey. You&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
wasn&#8217;t until I saw the car drive away that I
realized that I was still curled up into a ball on the saddle and
probably
looked pretty silly sitting that way. I also didn&#8217;t have the reins to
hold onto
so Old Smokey kept picking at the grass, taking a few steps and picking
at the
grass again. I couldn&#8217;t stop him from walking and I didn&#8217;t dare climb
off of
him while he was moving. Worse than that, however, he was slowly
walking away
from the farmhouse talking me with him! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Come
on old boy. Let&#8217;s go back to the house . .
.&#8221; I said trying to cajole him into somehow turning around. &#8220;Come on,
boy,
we&#8217;ve got to get back.&#8221; Still the horse walked on, stopping here and
there to
munch a little on some tender grass before taking a few steps again. I
guess
when you&#8217;re a horse stuck in a small paddock and you suddenly find
yourself
free in the middle of a huge pasture full green grass it&#8217;s only natural
to
explore. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Come
on old boy. Turn around. Be a good horsey
and take me back. You can do it boy.&#8221; Smokey just kept walking on doing
what
came naturally. This horse was really getting on my nerves. He was
totally
ignoring me. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you, you stupid beast. Don&#8217;t you
understand
English? Let&#8217;s go back now.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
tried once again to reach the reins but it was
no use. I turned around in the saddle to yell for Granny to help me but
she had
already had gone back inside. I resorted to bribery. In my sweetest and
most
sugary voice I said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back fella; I&#8217;ve got a big juicy carrot
with
your name on it back at the house. If you want it, it&#8217;s all yours but
you have
to go back to the house to get it. Come on boy. Turn around.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was beginning to get really nervous as I was
now over 200 yards from Granny&#8217;s house in a wide open pasture and I was
practically naked! &#8220;Come on you ornery critter, TURN YOUR FAT ASS
AROUND NOW!&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then I heard a whistle. Someone was
whistling almost like they were calling a dog or something. Old Smokey
perked
his head up and looked around. At first, I was sure it was just Granny
calling
her horse back. I felt relieved figuring that she must have noticed I
wasn&#8217;t
around and spotted the horse leading me away. Then I heard the whistle
again
and it definitely wasn&#8217;t coming from the direction of Granny&#8217;s place.
It was up
ahead!! It sounded as though it was coming from the woods another 200
yards in
front of me from where I was. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
had to get out of there! I kicked Old Smokey
with my feet and rocked in the saddle trying to get him to turn the
other way.
That was REALLY a stupid thing to do. I guess Smokey figured I wanted
him to
walk on and stop eating grass so that&#8217;s exactly what he did &#8211; he
walked, and
walked and walked. He didn&#8217;t stop to eat, he just walked He was taking
me right
towards the woods carrying me ever closer to whoever it was out there
and there
was no way to turn him! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO
YOU STUPID HORSE! GO THE OTHER WAY,&#8221; I
yelled. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
heard the whistle again and again. I covered
myself as best I could but I still was afraid I was going to fall off
so I had
to use one hand on the saddle horn to keep my balance while trying to
cover
myself with the other and I wasn&#8217;t doing a very good job of it either.
The
whistle was growing louder and more melodic as though whoever it was
out there
was making fun of me. They had to have seen me otherwise why would they
be
calling my horse other than to get a better look at me? I thought about
just
jumping off but I wasn&#8217;t used to riding a horse and I was afraid I&#8217;d
break a
bone or something trying to get out of the saddle while he was moving
so I held
on for dear life!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
woods were just a few yards away now. Any
moment I would surely be face to face with some boy I didn&#8217;t know
looking at my
boobs! HOLY CRAP!! My heart was fluttering now &#8211; no longer beating its
regular
rhythm. I felt lightheaded and clammy. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
horse entered the woods and stopped
suddenly. I looked around in a panic but could see no one. &#8220;Alright,
whoever
you are. You&#8217;ve had your fun now LEAVE ME ALONE!&#8221; There was silence.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
anxiously continued looking around but still
saw no one. &#8220;LOOK. THIS ISN&#8221;T FUNNY,&#8221; I yelled forcefully. Then I heard
the
whistle again and snapped my head towards the direction it came from. I
started
laughing. I couldn&#8217;t help myself. There, on a branch of a tree was the
biggest
woodpecker I had ever seen. He whistled again and I laughed some more.
There
was no one out here! It was just that stupid bird!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
let out a huge sigh of relief, carefully
climbed off the horse as Smokey just stood there, grabbed the reins off
the
ground and led him out of the woods and back towards Granny&#8217;s place. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Upon
reaching the house I heard Granny call out
the window, &#8220;Have a nice ride, dear?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That
night as I lay in bed all I could think
about was the events of the day. It wasn&#8217;t long before my hand was
exploring my
crotch. I couldn&#8217;t believe I had been topless for most of the day &#8211;
OUTSIDE no
less and in front of complete strangers!! I didn&#8217;t know quite what to
make of
it. It was so overwhelming I could scarcely take it all in. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">What
if that horse carried me on and on like
that. There&#8217;s no telling where I would have ended up. What if those
boys had
been in those woods and saw me!! Just then my breathing quickened, my
body
tensed and I had the first of many Big O&#8217;s that night. It was the most
intense
orgasm I had EVER experienced! Even after my climax was over I was
still
aroused and hungry for more. I found myself imagining being caught like
that. I
thought of the panic and terror that very idea filled my mind with. I
just
couldn&#8217;t sleep. It had been the most exciting day of my life!! I didn&#8217;t
want it
to end. I finally fell asleep with my hand still between my legs.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
following morning I was awakened by the
sound of Granny calling, &#8220;Katie! Are you going to sleep all day? It&#8217;s 7
o&#8217;clock. Breakfast is ready.&#8221; It took me a while to realize that she
was
calling me as I am used to my real name, Anna, not this Katie person&#8217;s
name. My
Gosh, I thought, farm people sure do get up early!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Be
right there,&#8221; I replied. It was then I noticed
that my hand was STILL between my legs, right where it hand been the
night
before. All I could do was smile. I washed up a bit and got dressed in
my
T-shirt and shorts and ambled into the kitchen.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
couldn&#8217;t eat much in the way of breakfast as
my stomach still had butterflies. It&#8217;s hard to describe but I was &#8220;on
edge&#8221; the
whole morning. I visited with Granny and listened to her tell me the
same
stories she had told me before and pretended to laugh at them as if it
was the
first time I had heard them and then did my chores. I ended up on the
porch in
early afternoon just staring at the landscape, daydreaming about the
previous
day. I just couldn&#8217;t get my mind off what had happened.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I sat there I became increasingly aware of
the weather. It was hot, extremely hot and humid. The air was sticky
and there
was only a slight breeze which helped but not a lot. There were
scattered
clouds here and there, but it didn&#8217;t look like rain. I thought about
going
inside but then I would lose even that poor excuse for a breeze. I was
hot,
miserable and bored. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
then spotted Old Smokey who was back in his
paddock. Terribly naughty thoughts began running around in my mind. I
wondered
what it would be like to go riding with him like Lady Godiva. Imagine
me,
completely naked riding around the farm! I couldn&#8217;t do such a thing . .
. could
I? I was wet at the very thought of it. Part of me wanted to do just
that, but
the rational part of me said there was no fucking way! What if
something went
wrong? Then again what fun it would be! I didn&#8217;t have to think about it
long as
Granny called me and said she had some things she needed my help with &#8211;
like
washing the bed linen by hand! YUK! That of course took me the rest of
the day
- so much for day dreaming. I never knew there was so much work to be
done on a
farm.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That
night I imagined me riding on Old Smokey
all over the farm without a stitch of clothing. It&#8217;s amazing how brave
one
becomes when one&#8217;s actions are only fantasy. I even gave myself another
Big &#8220;O&#8221;
imagining that I hid my clothes somewhere rather than carrying them
with me in
case of an emergency. That did it. I had made up my mind I was going to
do it!
Well, at least maybe for a little ride somewhere away from where Granny
could
see me anyway and yet close enough to the farm that I would be safe. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
heart rate was much faster than usual the
following morning. I was trying to figure out a way of asking Granny if
I could
ride Old Smokey by myself without her asking too many questions or
arousing her
suspicions. Every time I worked up the nerve to ask, I chickened out. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter, sweetie? You look like
something&#8217;s on your mind?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
I was wondering . . . um . . . I guess I
was wondering what the rest of the farm looks like. I mean I&#8217;ve been
here
several days now and haven&#8217;t really seen much of it. Mom said it&#8217;s
really a big
place.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That
it is, Katie, it&#8217;s almost 1,000 acres.
It&#8217;s been in our family for generations.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well
I was wondering, that is if you don&#8217;t need
me today if I could . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;That&#8217;s
a great Idea! I&#8217;ll go with you and show
you around.&#8221; My heart sank. That&#8217;s all I needed. So much for my little
adventure I thought. Then Granny said, &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that today. What
was I
thinking?! I&#8217;ve got to . . . oh, what in the heck was that I had to do
. . .
let me think. I was just saying to myself I had to do . . . Oh for
heaven&#8217;s
sakes. I&#8217;ll think of it sooner or later. Why don&#8217;t you just go
yourself? Or,
better yet, Take Old Smokey. You can cover a lot more ground that way.
You
don&#8217;t mind if I stay at home and do whatever it is I have to get done,
do you?
It&#8217;s hell to get old!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
couldn&#8217;t believe my luck! :&#8221;No Granny, I don&#8217;t
mind at all!&#8221; I said excitedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take good care of Old Smokey too.
Thanks
Grandma. Thanks a lot!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
somehow managed to catch and saddle that old
horse. My pulse was ecstatic and my body was tingling with excitement.
But,
could I actually go through with it? I really, honestly wasn&#8217;t at all
sure that
I could, but just the THOUGHT of maybe being out there and having the
opportunity
was enough to get me aroused! I had to at least try! But trust me, I
was a
realist. There was no way I was taking any chances. I could DREAM I was
Lady
Godiva all I wanted, but, in reality I was all &#8220;thought&#8221; and very
little
&#8220;courage.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Eventually
I got underway. Old Smokey took his
time and like Maddie had said, he just plodded along at a very slow
pace which
was perfectly okay with me. The longer I rode the hornier I got. Along
the way
I had to admit Granny&#8217;s place was beautiful. Such variety of scenery
and so
isolated. After riding along for about a half an hour and not seeing or
hearing
a soul, I finally got brave enough to take off my T-shirt. I draped it
on my
lap. The feeling of the cool morning air on my bra-covered chest was
stimulating.
I was very nervous at first but then I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore and
took off
my bra and it joined my T-shirt in my lap. That same feeling I had the
other
day riding topless came flooding back to me! I rode like this for some
time
being careful to make sure I wasn&#8217;t being observed. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
wanted to take off my shorts but I wasn&#8217;t sure
I could do it. I debated with myself mentally. It was so easy to tempt
myself
but actually DOING it was another matter. I really wanted to go all the
way and
just experience riding completely naked like Lady Godiva &#8211; even if it
was only
for a minute or two. I knew I was going to chicken out if I waited much
longer.
So . . . I pulled back on the reins and got off the horse and in one
quick
motion I took off my shorts and my panties. It was unbelievable! I
actually DID
IT!! I was so proud of myself! I got back up on the horse and rode on
more
aroused than I ever thought I could be. I was actually completely nude
in
public far away from home. Me, Anna, the shy city girl who had several
times
been called a &#8220;goody-two-shoes&#8221; at school; me the conservative &#8211; always
did-what-I-was told girl actually riding a horse naked! It felt
AWESOME! But .
. . somehow, I wanted more.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">What
I REALLY wanted was to make my fantasy of
the other night, come true- the one that caused the most exquisite
throbbing,
deep vaginal orgasm that I ever had, come true. I wanted to lose my
safety net.
I was riding along in one of Granny&#8217;s many pastures and saw another
line of
trees that I took for more forest. I quickly decided before I could
change my
mind that I would find a place to hide my clothes and then ride off and
leave
them. I had to see what it felt like to be totally and completely
vulnerable! I
knew what I was going to do was crazy but I just had to do it or I
would regret
it for the rest of my life. If I backed out now I didn&#8217;t think I would
ever
have the courage to try it again. Heck, I might never have the
opportunity to
try again for all I knew. At least that&#8217;s what I told myself to keep
from chickening
out. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
reached the tree line and stopped at a large
rock. I tossed my clothes onto the top of the rock and turned Old
Smokey
around. Riding off away from my clothes was the hardest thing I had
ever done.
It was also the most exciting thing I had ever done. I felt FREE and
liberated
. . . and horny and aroused and wild and crazy!! It was like I was a
different
person. I kept going and the farther away from my clothes I rode, the
more
intense the feelings I was experiencing!! It was like a high I had
never before
felt. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
rode for some time in and out of the forest
and wandered through several pastures. I pulled back on the reins after
entering another line of trees and stopped the horse. I was so wrapped
up in my
own feelings it wasn&#8217;t long before I started fingering myself right
there in
the saddle. I was about to lose control when my heart almost stopped.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hello!&#8221;
a voice called out.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
froze!! I was too overcome with fear to even
move a muscle or to think clearly for that matter. I just sat there.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
looked to my right and there standing on the
ground was a girl about my age. I just stared at her without saying a
word.
What could I say? She had just caught me playing with myself sitting on
top of
a horse totally naked! I was so totally and utterly humiliated. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I know you. Are you new around
here?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
just looked at her for a few moments before
realizing that my hand was still between my legs. I quickly yanked it
out and
put it behind my back as my fingers were still very wet. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
girl gave me a wry smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be shy.
It&#8217;s okay. I often do that myself&#8221; she said giggling, &#8220;though not on a
horse. I
hope you got yourself off before I interrupted you. My name&#8217;s Danielle
but most
people call me Danny. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Um
. . . my name is Anna.&#8221; I said, barely able
to get the words out. I suddenly remembered that Maddie had said she
had a girl
named Danny so I felt a little better about things &#8211; but not much! Her
comment
about seeing me fingering myself was so humiliating. Danny was cute -
REALLY
cute. It may have been just my hormones talking but on a scale of 1 to
10 she&#8217;d
be a 12! Having her see me naked while she was clothed only added to my
embarrassment. It reinforced how vulnerable I was.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh,
you&#8217;re Katie, Ruth&#8217;s relative. I heard you
were staying for the summer.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Um
. . . that&#8217;s right - for the summer. Why did
you just call me Katie instead of Anna?&#8220;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
girl ignored my question and giggled as she
looked me over. I wanted to push the issue and find out why everyone
wanted to
address me as Katie but she interrupted my train of thought by asking,
&#8220;Do you
always ride around naked on horseback?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No.&#8221;
I said almost in a whisper. I felt my face
grow flushed and I was sure I was beat red. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You
know, if you don&#8217;t put on some sunscreen
your body is going to match your face pretty soon.&#8221; Did you bring any
with
you?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No,
not really.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
climb on down. I have some here and I&#8217;ll
take care of you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
held out her hand and I decided to dismount.
She greeted me by patting me on my back and told me how pretty she
thought I
was, which made me blush all the more and then squirted some lotion in
her hand
and asked me to turn around. I complied and suddenly felt her hand
applying the
lotion to my back and shoulders. When she continued on down towards my
butt I
gasped! She was actually rubbing my rear end! She was touching me in a
private
place. I should have been repulsed at such intimate contact but as
worked up as
I was, it felt kind of nice so I let her continue massaging the lotion
into my
butt cheeks. When she was through with my back and legs she turned me
around
and before I could react she began rubbing lotion on my right breast!!!
It felt
good but I immediately blushed profusely and pulled away. &#8220;I think I
can do
this part myself.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
made a playful &#8220;mock frown&#8221;, and
unexpectedly gave my boob a tender kiss. &#8220;Mom was right. You are the
cutest
little thing!&#8221; She then watched with great interest studying my every
move as I
finished what she had started. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;ve
got some cold drinks up ahead if you want
to join me. It&#8217;s awfully hot out here today.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
didn&#8217;t really want to hang around talking to
this girl while I was naked but her offer sure sounded good. &#8220;Thanks.
That
would be nice.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
led me over to a blanket and pulled out a
Coke from a small cooler. &#8220;I often come here to write in my journal.
It&#8217;s
peaceful here and my brother doesn&#8217;t know about this place. Boys can be
such a
pain sometimes.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">We
talked for quite some time and I found out
that she was a really nice person. We talked about boys and she asked a
ton of
questions about what it was like to live in the city where I was from.
I really
was beginning to like her &#8211; a lot! I was still very wet and having her
watch me
&#8211; or should I say &#8220;devour me&#8221; with her eyes only made things worse. I
could
tell she was interested in me and that should have made me feel creepy
but for
some inexplicable reason it didn&#8217;t. It made me feel . . . well . . .
sexy
somehow. Eventually I realized that it was getting late and told her I
had to
get back before my Granny worried that something had happened to me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
stood up and bid her goodbye as she gave me
the most flirtatious smile and then walked off into the woods. I
watched her
leave and then turned around and discovered to my horror that Old
Smokey was
gone! He was GONE!! I was naked, far from my clothes and he was nowhere
to be
seen! That stupid beast must have walked on by himself. Gawd, I was in
so much
trouble.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
first thought was that Old Smokey couldn&#8217;t
have gone far. He was most likely just picking at the grass somewhere
close by.
I was sure I could find him. &#8220;Here, Smokey old boy. Here Horsey,&#8221; I
called out
as I emerged from the woods and scoured the pasture for any signs of
where he
might have went. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
ventured out into the middle of the open field
and looked around. &#8216;COME ON, BOY! Let&#8217;s go home!&#8221; I yelled sweetly. I
saw and
heard nothing. I went to the other side of the pasture and still there
was no
sign of where he might have gotten to. I couldn&#8217;t remember if I had
tied him up
or not when I got off of him after being discovered by Danny. I guess
my mind
was on other things at the time like getting my &#8220;hand caught in the
cookie jar&#8221;
as it were. I had no one to blame for my carelessness than myself. How
stupid
could I be?</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
then thought that perhaps Smokey was still in
the woods somewhere back where Danny and I had our little picnic and I
just
missed him. I decided to go back and check. Surely he would be there
and
everything would be okay again. Upon reaching the woods and searching
around
for quite some distance in several directions, I failed to find even a
trace of
him &#8211; no horse poop on the ground, no broken branches &#8211; nothing!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
began to get a little worried. I ran this way
and that calling out for that stupid horse. I ventured into several
more
pastures and several stands of tall trees looking for him but to no
avail. I
expanded my search ever farther hoping that I would spot him. I wasn&#8217;t
sure how
long I had spent visiting with Danny but surely it wasn&#8217;t THAT long,
was it? I
couldn&#8217;t remember. I kept telling myself that Old Smokey would be just
around
the next bend, or in the next pasture or maybe in the next field. I
changed directions
about a dozen times and still there was no sign that idiot beast! Of
course I
was very acutely aware that all the while I was doing this I had no
clothes on
&#8211; NOTHING to cover myself with. Though that circumstance was very
arousing
earlier &#8211; now that I was without my horse far, far from home it was
very scary!
</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
decided to quit searching for him and go and
retrieve my clothes before someone else spotted me. I knew I would feel
better
if I wasn&#8217;t naked. I headed off towards a line of trees to get to the
rock
where I had left my stuff. Reaching the trees, I didn&#8217;t see the rock.
&#8220;WHERE IS
THE FUCKING ROCK?!&#8221; I screamed in exasperation. It&#8217;s supposed to be
right
here!&#8221; I said pointing to a spot on the ground where I was sure it was
located.
&#8220;Who could have taken such a HUGE rock?! This doesn&#8217;t make sense!&#8221;
Perhaps I
had just made a mistake.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Adrenalin
began pumping through my veins and I
ran to the next section of woods &#8211; but there was no rock! I ran to
another,
then another &#8211; still no rock! OMG I forgot where the rock was! Hell I
didn&#8217;t
even know where I was, let alone where that stupid rock was supposed to
be. I
began to panic! &#8220;Where AM I?&#8221; I mumbled to myself. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to figure
out how
to get home!!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
full weight of the situation began to hit
me. I was lost in a place I was not familiar with, totally naked and
very
scared and the possibility of being discovered was growing higher and
higher. I
HAD to do something! &#8220;Think, girl . . .THINK!! &#8220;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
looked about trying to get my bearings. &#8220;The woods
across from that far field look familiar,&#8221; I said to myself. I studied
my
surroundings some more. &#8220;Yes, I think THAT is where my clothes are. I&#8217;m
SURE of
it.&#8221; So off I went jogging across the open field, my boobs bouncing
freely and
my hair flying in the wind. I must have looked a sight!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
got to the trees and surveyed the area and to
my disappointment there was no rock, no clothes not even Smokey&#8217;s poop
to guide
me. I was about to break down and cry when I spotted something out of
the
corner of my eye &#8211; a dirt road!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;YEEHAAAW!!&#8221;
I screamed at the top of my lungs!
I saw a dirt road! I recalled that when I was looking for that lake the
other
day I followed a dirt road. Perhaps this was that same road! I wasn&#8217;t
sure but
it was the first positive sign I had so far that I might be closer to
home than
I thought. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was taking a chance walking naked along such a
road but I was sure that I could hear or at least spot a car coming
long before
the people in the car could see me. I could always jump into the woods
if I did
see someone coming. So off I went. I walked along for maybe 30 minutes
along
that dusty road and saw nothing that seemed familiar.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
mind was in overdrive worrying about all
sorts of things. It&#8217;s funny how your mind plays tricks on you when you
are
anxious and scared. Several times I thought I saw a car approaching in
the
distance and ran for cover only to realize that it was just waves of
heat
rising from the ground blurring things at a distance. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
I froze. I thought I heard laughter. I ran
for cover and listened carefully. There was no mistaking it. I was
hearing
laughter. Perhaps I was near the lake. If I was, I should be pretty
close to
home! I felt a wave of relief for a moment then I worried that maybe it
wasn&#8217;t
the lake at all and I was near somewhere strange like someone else&#8217;s
farm house
or something. I had to check it out to be sure. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
slowly crept through the woods trying to make
sure I was hidden by the brush or trees as I made my way. I still
couldn&#8217;t see
much from where I was but the voices were growing louder so I knew I
must be
going in the right direction. Just one little peak, I thought, and I&#8217;ll
know if
it was the lake or somewhere else. I just had to get close enough to
see. I saw
a large hedgerow ahead of me and I decided just to dart over to it,
crouch down
and then peak my head up to see what was ahead. I stood up and started
to trot
toward my objective. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;HEY!&#8221;
someone shouted &#8220;THERE&#8217;S A NAKED GIRL
OVER THERE!&#8221; Holy Crap, I had been spotted!!! I bolted and ran as fast
as I
could to the 3-foot tall hedgerow and ducked down beside it.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;NO
WAY,&#8221; a boy&#8217;s voice said. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing
things.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m
telling you there WAS A NAKED GIRL OUT
THERE.&#8221; The first boy insisted.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
carefully peaked over the bush I was hiding
behind to see what I was up against and I saw 5 teenage boys &#8211; ALL
NAKED
standing up in the water looking in my general direction. One boy was
even
erect &#8211;his penis sticking straight up in the air in front of him! Under
other
circumstances I would have been thrilled to see that, but not now! Fear
ran up
my spine! Some boy saw me naked!! Now they ALL will see me naked. My
only hope
was to keep hidden and hope they wouldn&#8217;t see me. There&#8217;s no telling
what 5
naked teenage boys would do if they caught a naked teenage girl all
alone in
the woods. I could literally feel my pulse bounding up my neck and my
breathing
was as fast as if I had just run a 4-minute mile.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Are
you sure?&#8221; another boy said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
anything.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;She
was over there,&#8221; the troublemaker said
pointing his finger toward my hedgerow. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;If
you&#8217;re so sure, why don&#8217;t you go over there
and see.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I&#8217;m
not going over there. Maybe I was
mistaken.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter, you chicken? Frank is a
chicken, Frank is a chicken.&#8221; Soon all the other boys started chanting.
I felt
bad for the boy but I was glad because I was hoping their teasing would
make
the boy forget about looking for me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
am NOT a chicken. I&#8217;ll show you. I really DID
see something out there.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yeah
. . . prove it.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay,
I will. I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
other boys were all laughing and carrying on
as the boy I called the troublemaker began walking towards me. I wanted
to run
but I was sure if I did that they would all run after me &#8211; literally
chase me
down like some animal and tackle me and do . . . well I didn&#8217;t want to
think
about that. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
the boy got closer I don&#8217;t know what got into
me, but I suddenly found myself standing up over the waist high shrub
exposing
my boobs for all to see and pointing my finger right at the boys.
&#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU
DARE COME ANY CLOSER! I&#8217;M WARNING YOU . . . I SEE YOU GUYS!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then,
to my utter and complete surprise, all 5
boys screamed, covered the privates and began scurrying about as fast
as they
could. It looked like a Chinese fire drill as they ran about in a panic
trying
to pick up their clothes.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;IT
IS A GIRL!. LET&#8217;S GET THE HELL OUT OF
HERE!!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
boys then ran to the opposite side of the
lake like they had a few days earlier and disappeared into the woods
waving
their clothes trying to keep themselves covered. It was the funniest
thing I
had ever seen. Here I was worried that these boys would totally take
advantage
of me once they saw that there really was a naked girl watching them,
when all
the time they were so worried about protecting their modesty because a
GIRL had
seen their penises. I&#8217;ll never figure boys out. It was almost as if
they were
ashamed that I was looking at what they had between their legs! What a
hoot!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Well,
at least I found the lake. Now all I had
to do was follow that dirt road back to Granny&#8217;s and I&#8217;d be home free! </span>
<br>
<b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Buoyed
by my new-found confidence after watching
the boys scatter, I returned to the dirt road and began following it. I
walked
and walked. I wasn&#8217;t really paying much attention to the scenery as I
was just
ever so glad that this ordeal was almost over! Soon I&#8217;d be back at
Granny&#8217;s and
all would be fine. Well . . . I still had to explain about Old Smokey
but at
least I&#8217;d be safe again. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
walking another half an hour I began to
get a little concerned. I should have been at Granny&#8217;s by now, I
thought. I
didn&#8217;t remember walking this long to get to the lake the other day. I
tried
convincing myself that her place was just up ahead around a few turns,
maybe
past a few more trees. But when I finally completed those turns and
passed
those trees there was only more dirt road. I began to think that maybe
I went
the wrong way or maybe there was another dirt road that led to Granny&#8217;s
and
that I only stumbled upon the lake by accident. Hell, maybe there was
even
another lake for all I knew! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then
I saw a large sweeping curve - a bend in
the road that looked familiar. &#8220;NOW I know where I am. Granny&#8217;s place
is just
around that bend,&#8221; I mumbled confidently to myself. I picked up my pace
and
began skipping along hoping to reach home.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT
THE . . .&#8221; I said as I made the curve.
Right before my eyes, maybe 30 feet away was the paved main street of
the
town!! There were cars passing by and people - LOTS of people walking
on the
sidewalks going into and out of the shops! I had walked all the way to
town!! </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
stood there frozen as I was mesmerized by the
scene in front of me. The town was much bigger than I had remembered it
being
on my first ride through it on my way to Granny&#8217;s. There was a lot more
foot
traffic and cars traveling on main-street. There seemed to be more
shops and
stores too. I just stood there taking it all in like I was in some sort
of
mental fog or something. Here I was, standing on a dirt road completely
naked
miles from my farm and my clothes. I had no idea how I had got there
and no idea
how I was going to get back. I was practically numb with fear. My hands
immediately covered my body &#8211; one hand over my chest and the other
trying
desperately to cover my pubes. If people only knew that a naked teenage
girl
was standing not 30 feet from them as they went about their business.
That
thought instantly brought me back out of the fog I had been in and I
began
looking around for cover.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">My
sudden movement must have caught a young
woman&#8217;s attention as she walked along the sidewalk across the paved
main street
that ran from left to right up ahead. She stopped, did a double-take
looking
right at me for a moment. Then, to my surprise, she waved her hand in
the air
as a greeting and yelled, &#8220;HELLO KATIE!!&#8221; She then resumed walking down
the
sidewalk as if seeing a naked girl in town was no big deal. I had no
idea who
that person was. I had never seen her before in my life. How did she
know who I
was? That was just weird!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
immediately darted for cover into the trees
that lined the dirt road and hid behind some shrubs. It suddenly dawned
on me
after I collected myself that something really peculiar was going on.
How did
that stranger know that my Granny called me Katie? Why did she just
wave at me
and then just walk on rather than check to see if I was in trouble. I
mean I
would have thought that if I had seen a naked and frightened girl in
town, my
first instinct would be that something bad had happened to her and that
she
might need assistance and call the police or something. Oh GAWD . . .
did that girl
call the police on me?! Maybe she did and I just didn&#8217;t notice. I HAD
to get
out of there.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
only thing to do was to head back down the
road back the way I came. I may not have known where Granny&#8217;s farm was,
but I
knew I couldn&#8217;t stay in town naked. I would just die! There was no way
I could
stay hidden forever either. I was about to jump and run for the dirt
road when
I noticed a car coming down that road heading towards town! I
immediately
ducked back into my hiding place as the car passed by. WHEW! That was
close! I
was almost spotted. I waited a few more moments and tried again. To my
horror,
another fricken car was coming, only this time it came from town and
was
heading back up the road the way I had come. Things were getting much
too busy.
I figured that it must be late enough in the afternoon that people must
be
getting off of work which is why the town seemed so much busier than I
had
remembered it. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Panic
was REALLY setting in now. I couldn&#8217;t stay
here until it was dark as I was absolutely sure I couldn&#8217;t find my way
at
night. Besides, I was too much of a coward being afraid of things that
come out
when the sun goes down to even try. What was I going to do? I had to
think.
Then I saw her &#8211; a friendly face that I recognized. Mrs. Hoffman was
walking
along the sidewalk after just coming out of one of the shops</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Like
my incident at the lake where I somehow
found the courage to act, I stood up, jumped out from my hiding place
and
yelled: &#8220;MRS. HOFFMAN!&#8221; She stopped and looked around for a moment
trying to
figure out who had called her. &#8220;OVER HERE!!&#8221; I shouted waving my hands
in the
air. &#8220;I&#8217;m over here!&#8221; She turned in my direction and spotted me and
began
walking towards me as I quickly returned to my hiding place for cover.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Hello
Katie. What are you doing out here?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Ms.
Hoffman!&#8221; I said with relief. &#8220;Am I ever so
glad to see you !! I . . . um . . . sort of had a little situation.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What
happened? Did you get hurt?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No.
I . . . um, that is Old Smokey, that&#8217;s
Granny&#8217;s horse, anyways I was riding him and when I got down from the
saddle,
he sort of took off and I lost him. I looked for him but I got lost and
somehow
ended up here.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Lost
your clothes too, I see,&#8221; she said with a
wild grin causing me to blush profusely. I just looked at the ground
trying to
think of what to say that wouldn&#8217;t sound ridiculous. &#8220;No matter,&#8221; Ms.
Hoffman
said plainly. &#8220;Would you like for me to give you a lift back home?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
COULD you?!! I&#8217;d be ever so grateful.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
actually it&#8217;s no trouble. It&#8217;s not that
far &#8211; maybe a fifteen minute ride out of town.&#8221; Then, after taking my
hand and
helping me to my feet, she said those words that made my heart stop,
&#8220;My car is
just around the corner. It&#8217;s not far.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;But
. . . I CAN&#8221;T go with you like this!!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
smiled and began walking towards town with
me in tow, &#8220;Why not? You&#8217;ve made it this far haven&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s just a
quick
walk. No one will notice.&#8221; Before I could protest we were walking along
on the
sidewalk in front of the shops!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then I heard someone else call out, &#8220;HEY,
KATIE! NICE DAY ISN&#8217;T IT?&#8221; I turned back over my shoulder and saw
another
teenage girl about my age waving at me with a huge grin on her face. I
didn&#8217;t
know who she was either. She just waved and then walked on.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
we reached her car that was parked in front
of a store on main street, a car passed us by and then another. I was
petrified
with fear. I just knew I was going to get into trouble! Mrs. Hoffman
struggled
with her keys to unlock her car door. As I looked around, people were
everywhere
&#8211; across the street, in the shops, sitting on benches that lined the
street
here and there, yet no one seemed to pay much attention to me. They all
seemed
preoccupied with their own business. I felt weird being totally naked
in the
middle of town! It was a rush really, in more ways than one. I had
fantasized
about being Lady Godiva, but at least she had a horse. Here I was on
foot in
plain view of everybody!! Oh I wish she would Hurry up!!!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Finally
she got the door open and said, &#8220;Hop
in.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She
didn&#8217;t have to tell me that twice. I
immediately opened the passenger door and hopped into her car. She
tried making
polite conversation about the weather and made small talk as we headed
back
down the dirt road. She made a bunch of turns and took several dirt
roads
before straightening out and heading in one direction. No wonder I was
lost, I
thought. There must a dozen dirt roads around this town. I was ever so
thankful
that she didn&#8217;t ask me why I was naked. I really didn&#8217;t have a clue
what I
would have said to try and explain my state of undress. I think she
knew I was
mortified as it was. Most of the ride was made in silence, though
several times
I caught her looking at me and smiling. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
Grandma&#8217;s farm came into view I going to ask
Ms. Hoffman to stop and let me out before reaching the gate. I just
knew that
if Granny saw me getting out of Ms. Hoffman&#8217;s car things would be worse
for me.
Fortunately, once again, this kind and gentle lady must have sensed by
predicament and stopped the car on her own a good distance from
Granny&#8217;s house.
&#8220;I think it best that you make your way from here, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
Ma&#8217;am,&#8217; I sighed with great relief.
&#8220;Thanks for understanding.&#8221; I then got out of the car as she watched my
every
move. Did you know it&#8217;s hard to get off of leather seats in a lady-like
fashion
when you&#8217;re naked? Your skin sticks to the leather seats. I&#8217;m sure I
showed her
a lot more than what was appropriate. Still she said nothing &#8211; just
smiled at
me and waved good-bye. &#8220;See you later,&#8221; she said as she sped out of
sight.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
wondered what she meant by that. I stood there
watching her dust cloud settle for a few moments as I tried to collect
myself.
Then I reluctantly headed toward Granny&#8217;s house. She was sitting on the
porch
in her rocking chair sewing on something as I approached. &#8220;&#8221;Bout time
you got
back. Where you been?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
that&#8217;s a long story. About Old Smokey . .
. it seems that . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Seems
you LOST him, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; she
interrupted before I could finish explaining.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
sort of . . . you see . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Looks
like you lost your clothes too. What in
the world have you been doing?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s
not what you think, Grandma. It&#8217;s like
this, I . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Never
mind, I hate long stories. Best go and
unsaddle your horse and put him away.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;WHAT?&#8221;
I exclaimed as I saw Granny pointing
behind me. I turned around and to my surprise there was that old nag of
a horse
standing in the pasture still wearing his saddle picking at the grass.
&#8220;But . .
. How did he get . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;He
wandered home several hours ago. Looks to me
like you had an interesting day, little lady. Now you best get to
tending to
him. Brush him good before putting him up, you hear?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Yes,
Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I replied as politely as I could. I
was glad that she too didn&#8217;t press me on what happened to my clothes. I
caught
that stupid horse and gave him an earful for leaving me stranded in the
fields
like he did. I may be crazy but I was sure he understood what he had
done to
me. He was as sly as a fox, that one. After putting the saddle away I
went into
the house to finally get into some clothes. I had had enough of this
nudity
thing. I had my crazy adventure and I wanted to be a normal person
again.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Upon
reaching my room I couldn&#8217;t find my
suitcase. I had been using it to store all my stuff in as I was too
lazy to
unpack and put everything away in the chest of drawers. I looked under
the bed,
in the small closet &#8211; everywhere and I couldn&#8217;t find it. I figured
Granny must
have moved it so I went through the house and still was unable to find
it
anywhere.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny,
have you seen my suitcase? It&#8217;s
missing.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Suitcase?

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;The
one I brought with me from home. It was
right next to my bed when I left this morning.&#8221;</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I

think you are mistaken.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny!
I had all my clothes in it. I need my
suitcase. Now, please try and remember.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;ALL</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">
your clothes? Honey, you&#8217;ve been wearing that same T-shirt and pair of
shorts
since you&#8217;ve been here. I&#8217;ve never seen you in anything else. If you
had a
suitcase full of clothes why haven&#8217;t you been wearing different outfits
instead
of the same thing every day? Your memory must be going. It happens to
me all
the time.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh

playing games. I need my suitcase!&#8221;</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
don&#8217;t care for your tone young lady. First,
you lost my horse, then you lost the clothes that you left with this
morning
and now you lost your suitcase and you&#8217;re blaming ME for it? If you
can&#8217;t take
better care of your things that&#8217;s not my problem.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny,
I NEED CLOTHES! I can&#8217;t go around like
this? Everything I had with me was in that suitcase!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
and you think I&#8217;m made of money that I can
just drop everything and buy you a whole new wardrobe? Fat chance. If
you
really had a suitcase, it will turn up or you&#8217;ll remember where you put
it. If
you didn&#8217;t have one, then this will teach you to take better care of
the things
you do have. You came home naked after being out all day so it must not
bother
you too much, dearie.&#8221;</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
just sighed. I was exasperated with that old
woman. I couldn&#8217;t get too mad at her though as she was old and most
likely a
bit demented. I was sure that my suitcase was indeed around the farm
someplace.
I mean, as far as I knew Granny never left the farm so even if she
accidentally
misplaced it I was sure I could find it if I looked hard enough. </span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
looked and looked for the rest of the
afternoon but I never could find it. I even checked the chicken coop
and in the
barn! I looked under blankets, in trash cans, and even looked UNDER the
house.
Nothing!</span>

you can&#8217;t have company!! I haven&#8217;t

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
you worry too much. It will turn up sooner
or later &#8211; that is if you really HAD a suitcase. Besides I&#8217;ve made you
something I want you to wear tonight so you best get cleaned up, oh,
and do
something with your hair.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny
then disappeared down the hall to her
room. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">This
whole day had been unbelievable and it
wasn&#8217;t over yet. At least Granny made had me something. I guess that&#8217;s
what she
had been sewing on when I came home earlier. I headed down the hall and
started
pouring water into a basin in the bathroom and went about cleaning up.
As I
looked in the mirror I realized that she was right about my hair. It
was a
tangled mess. It took some time but I managed to brush it enough that
it looked
presentable. It was the best I could do under the circumstances. It
will be a
relief to finally get some clothes on, I thought.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">When
I returned to the front room Granny was
dressed in her Sunday best. She was wearing a beautiful frock and even
had a
nice broach pinned to her chest. I had never seen her dressed so nice.
&#8220;This
must be some pretty special company,&#8221; I said, &#8220;for you to be getting
all
dressed up like that.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
it&#8217;s not every night you get invited out
to dinner.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;YOU&#8217;RE
DRIVING us out to dinner somewhere?!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;No,
I think someone else is picking us up. They
should be here any minute. In fact, they&#8217;re running a little late. I
expected
them to be here by now. I don&#8217;t drive, you know and I don&#8217;t often get
out these
days. Now come over here so I can have you put on what I made for you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Gee,
Grandma, thanks for going to all that
trouble. You&#8217;re a life saver.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny
had me stand in the middle of the room as
she reached into a small box lined with tissue paper a pulled out a
hat. It was
a straw hat with a large royal blue ribbon running around it with two
long
streams hanging down the back. Stuffed into the ribbon hatband were
small fresh
flowers and some ornamental baby&#8217;s breath.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Do
you like it?&#8221; she asked holding it out
proudly so I could see it.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
looked very old-fashioned to me. It was
something I wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead in but I didn&#8217;t want to hurt her
feelings.
&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s lovely. You don&#8217;t see many women wearing hats these days.
Women
don&#8217;t wear hats in the city much. Are these things still in fashion out
here in
your town?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
yes. It&#8217;s quite common for important
occasions like Easter Sunday and Founder&#8217;s day and such &#8211; especially
since Kate
Middleton, that English Duchess Lady wears hats. Try it on and let me
adjust it
for you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
took the hat and put it gently on my head as
Granny applied some finishing touches. &#8220;Now hold still, dearie, as I&#8217;m
going to
put in a hat pin to hold it in place and keep it from blowing away.&#8221; I
felt her
fiddling with it as she stood behind me for a few minutes. &#8220;There,
how&#8217;s that
feel?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It
feels fine.&#8221; I replied. Granny then held up
a mirror for me to see how I looked. Much to my surprise I really
looked great.
Despite my earlier misgivings, the hat&#8217;s design and the color of the
ribbon
really set off my complexion. I actually liked how it looked on me.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Some
people are just made for hats, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It
looks marvelous, Granny, thank you! Now I
had better hurry and get the rest of my things on before your company
arrives.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
. . . did you finally locate your suitcase,
dearie?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;What?
No, I mean the rest of the things you
made for me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re
already wearing what I made for you -
the hat. I worked on it all afternoon.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny!
I have to have something to wear. Did
you already forget? I told you I don&#8217;t have anything else to wear. All
my
clothes were in my suitcase, remember?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Just
then there was a knock on the door. My
heart stopped yet again as Granny hollered, &#8220;COME IN. It&#8217;s open!&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Before
I could dash for cover in walked a man
who, after noticing me, broke into a broad smile and just stood there
gawking
at me. Maddie came in next followed by her daughter Danny. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Come
in, come in,&#8221; Granny said invitingly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see you.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Ms.
Maddie looked at me a bit apprehensively and
said apologetically, &#8220;Oh, are we too early? I thought we were supposed
to be
here at 7 o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;You&#8217;re
right on time,&#8221; Granny said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all
ready to go. Do you like the hat I made for Katie?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;It&#8217;s
adorable,&#8221; the man quickly replied, &#8220;best
hat I&#8217;ve seen yet. In fact, I can&#8217;t stop looking at it.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I&#8217;ll
bet that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s looking at, I thought
to myself.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
goodness me, I&#8217;ve forgotten my manners.
Charles, this is my granddaughter Katie. She&#8217;s spending the summer with
me.
Katie, Charles is Maddie&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
thirty-something year old man walked up to
me and extended his hand to shake mine. &#8220;Pleased to me you, Katie.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;My
name is ANNA,&#8221; I rudely snapped back. &#8220;Why
does everyone insist on calling me KATIE?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now,
now,&#8221; Granny said admonishingly, &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have none of that. Katie&#8217;s just a bit upset. Seems she misplaced her
suitcase
today with all of her clothes. That&#8217;s just like a kid, you know - can&#8217;t
seem to
take care of her things. Still, I can&#8217;t let that ruin a special night
like
tonight. I am so looking forward to dinner. Come along, everybody. We
don&#8217;t
want to be late.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Perhaps
Katie might like to stay home,&#8221; Danny said
rushing to my defense. &#8220;You guys can go and enjoy your dinner and I&#8217;ll
be glad
to stay here and keep Anna, I mean Katie, company. I&#8217;ll even help her
look for
her suitcase.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
heaven&#8217;s no! I&#8217;ve been looking forward to
introducing Katie to our hosts. Like I said before, I don&#8217;t often get
asked out
and I have never had the opportunity to show off my granddaughter.
She&#8217;s
coming. Everything will be fine. No one will mind if a little girl is a
bit
underdressed.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Well,
if you&#8217;re sure it will be alright,&#8221;
Maddie said a bit hesitantly.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Sure,
I&#8217;m sure. Now let&#8217;s get going.&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
looked at Ms. Maddie hoping she would think of
something to get me out of this but she just gave me that &#8220;oh well&#8221;
look as if
she was resigned as to not cause a scene. I could tell she didn&#8217;t want
to upset
my Grandmother and was willing to bow to her wishes. It was as if she
knew what
Granny was doing was wrong but she didn&#8217;t want to cross her for some
reason. At
least that&#8217;s how it seemed to me. It was all so surreal. Behind that
pleasant
exterior, Granny had that way about her that made people just give in
to her.
Perhaps it was just because people knew she was a bit crazy and
doddery. I knew
then it was hopeless to resist further. I was screwed and I knew it.
Ms. Maddie
knew it too. I saw the look of empathy on her face but there was
nothing she
could do. She wasn&#8217;t going to interfere. For whatever reason if SHE was
willing
to accept my crazy grandmother&#8217;s idea that this was proper, than I
wasn&#8217;t going
to persuade Granny any differently. The look in her husband&#8217;s eyes, for
obvious
reasons, confirmed that he was okay with this too. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">We
all walked out to their minivan. Maddie and
her husband sat up front while Danny, Granny and I sat in the bench
seat in the
back and just like that we were off. Gawd, did I feel like a fool
wearing a hat
and being otherwise completely naked!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
looked over at Danny and she just stifled a
giggle. I could tell she thought it was hilarious. Ha, ha &#8211; big joke I
thought
to myself. She wouldn&#8217;t think it was so funny if she was the one
sitting in
that van naked!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">It
wasn&#8217;t long and we were driving down the
center of town. The place was practically deserted now. I couldn&#8217;t help
but
recall that only a short while ago I was actually walking down that
very sidewalk
completely in the nude! Little did I know that I&#8217;d be back again
dressed in the
same way so soon! It sent chills up my spine.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I looked at that sidewalk and recalled the
people that saw me and called me Katie, something was nagging at me in
the back
of my mind. Something that said things weren&#8217;t right somehow but I
couldn&#8217;t put
my finger on it. Something that made me feel that there was something
else
besides a little old lady that was hopelessly confused. I shook my head
as I
concluded that it must all be just my imagination. After all, I had
quite a day
so far. Maybe I was just so overwhelmed I wasn&#8217;t thinking straight.
Still . . .</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was jolted back to reality when we pulled into
a driveway at a house just outside of town. There were several cars
parked on
the grass as well as two in the driveway. &#8220;This can&#8217;t be good,&#8221; I
thought to
myself. There must be a bunch of people here other than the owners of
this
place. I took a deep breath as Charles shut off the motor and everyone
began to
get out of the vehicle.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Through
the open side door of the van I could
hear the sounds of people enjoying themselves emanating from inside the
house
confirming my worst fears that this was more than just a small dinner
among
neighbors which did little to help my self-confidence. To top it all
off, it
was still fairly light outside as it was summer and that meant I had to
exit
the car in daylight, without the cover of darkness. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Come
along, dearie. I can&#8217;t wait to introduce
you to my friends.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Granny,
I&#8217;m not sure that . . .&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Oh
you look fine. You clean up pretty good for
a little kid,&#8221; she said with a wink almost half-jokingly as she reached
in to
take hold of my hand. I curtly brushed it aside and got out on my own.
I wasn&#8217;t
a little kid and I definitely wasn&#8217;t going to be treated like one.
Granny
looking pleased with herself, took a huge, deep breath and exclaimed,
&#8220;Oh my,
something smells good. I wonder what we are having for dinner. Let&#8217;s
get
inside, shall we?&#8221; She then started quickly walking towards the door
followed
by Charles and his daughter Danny. I was happy to stall a bit until
they
reached the door before making my move so I could use them for cover. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Ms.
Maddie, who had politely waited for me until
I was ready, put her arm around my shoulder and gave me an empathetic
smile.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be okay. Everyone knows that your grandmother has a little
problem with
her memory and judgment. She doesn&#8217;t mean any harm. She basically has a
heart
of gold and she&#8217;s really such a good person otherwise. We all just
accept her
for what she is. You won&#8217;t get into any trouble. We all understand.
Trust me.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">That
was easy for her to say, I thought. She
wasn&#8217;t about to attend a dinner party wearing only a stupid hat!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
I reached the door with the others, Granny
rang the doorbell. I was a nervous wreck standing there wondering what
was
about to happen. The door opened and a very smartly dressed woman in
her
mid-thirties greeted us. &#8220;Hello! I&#8217;m sooooo glad you all could come. I
don&#8217;t
know why we don&#8217;t do this more often? Please, come in. Make yourselves
at
home.&#8221; Our host nodded toward each guest as they entered the house,
&#8220;Evening,
Charles . . . Hello Danny, aren&#8217;t you looking nice this evening. It&#8217;s
good to
see you in a pretty dress for a change.&#8221; Then her eyes grew large when
she
spotted me and she broke out into an awkward and obviously forced
smile. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
. . . this young lady, Ruth?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Why,
this is my granddaughter, Katie,&#8221; she said
proudly as she pushed me forward so our host could get a better view.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t
she just the cutest thing?&#8221; </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
woman gave a surprised expression as she
looked me over, obviously taken aback by my lack of clothes. She seemed
a bit
uneasy &#8211; nervous perhaps - that my Grandmother had dragged a naked
teenager to
her dinner party. She looked at me for a moment as if she wasn&#8217;t quite
sure
what to say as she stuttered a few times trying to get the words out,
then she
exclaimed with obviously feigned pleasure, &#8220;Ruth, she&#8217;s ADORABLE. I can
see why
you brag on her so much. Katie, I&#8217;m so glad to finally meet you.&#8221; The
uneasiness
of Miss Amy at my nudity was apparent in her voice despite what she had
actually said and that gave me gave concern that Ms. Maddie&#8217;s
reassurance that
everything will be alright wasn&#8217;t really so. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny,
unfazed, by the woman&#8217;s discomfort, continued
happily, &#8220;Katie, this is Miss Amy. She teaches at our high school. She
does a
fantastic job too. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll like her a lot. If you&#8217;re having any
trouble
with math, she&#8217;s the person to ask. I recommended her for the job when
she
first came to town, you know. One of the best decisions I ever made, I
think.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Miss
Amy, still obviously not sure what to make
of it all, reluctantly resumed the role of the perfect hostess, &#8220;Please
. . .
come in. Let me introduce my guests here this evening.&#8221; Miss Amy then
escorted
me into the middle of the front room that was filled with 8 or 9 people
&#8211; a few
younger couples and several older men and women all milling about
engaged in
conversation. Each was also dressed to the hilt in fancy clothes. Miss
Amy put
her arm around behind me, took a deep breath and called out, &#8220;Everyone
. . .
Could I have everyone&#8217;s attention, please. This is Ruth&#8217;s
Granddaughter,
Katie.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">You
could have heard a pin drop as everyone
turned and one by one noticed that a naked teenager was standing in the
room!
All conversation ceased and only the sound of a large grandfather clock
ticking
away the seconds could be heard filling the room with an ominous sense
of
dread. No one spoke. They only stared, their gaze fixed on my body. I
could
have just died! As I looked around the room, their expressions weren&#8217;t
of
shock, anger or even indignation &#8211; their facial expressions were just
blank &#8211;
providing no clues as to what they were thinking. Being the center of
attention
in front of a group of strangers I almost pissed on the floor and my
legs grew
so weak I thought I was going to collapse. I glanced over at Ms. Maddie
and it
was almost as if she was saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; such was the look on her
face.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Granny,
not to be one to take a back seat
continued to keep things moving. &#8220;Fred,&#8221; she said turning to an older
gentleman
standing by the fireplace, &#8220;how do you like Katie&#8217;s hat? I made it
myself this
afternoon.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
man cleared his throat and replied, &#8220;Is that
so? It&#8217;s quite stylish I think. It looks good on her, it compliments
her . . .
that is to say it goes nicely with her . . . eyes.&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;I
thought so too,&#8221; Granny said sweetly. She
then took me around the room and made personal introductions to
everyone. I
felt like a slab of meat on sale at the grocers and everyone wanted a
piece of
me. At least now that everyone had seen me they became a bit more at
ease as
they talked with Granny and a few even asked me a question or two. The
mood was
still tense, but the shock was over for most of them and, like Maddie
had
indicated earlier, they seemed to accept the eccentricities of my
Grandmother.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Still,
I was completely naked except for my
stupid hat among a room of not only clothed people but fancy-dressed
clothed
people at that, which made me feel even more out of place. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Okay,
everyone, &#8220;Dinner is ready. If you all
would make your way to the dining room,&#8221; Miss Amy announced. At last, I
thought, things will finally get moving so I could get out of this
place. It
could have been worse. I suppose. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
the guests made their way down the small
corridor and into the dining room, I waited until last letting the
adults go
first, out of politeness of course. My mother would have insisted on
proper etiquette
at dinner parties. My mother &#8211; HA! She would have a stroke if she could
see me
now - her prim and proper daughter NAKED at a private, fancy dinner
party!! Somehow
that thought was pretty amusing to me. I secretly had always wanted to
rebel
against the tight control she exercised over me. I smiled a bit at that
thought. &#8220;Take THAT mommy dearest.&#8221; At least I&#8217;d could always look back
on this
awkward moment later on and take pleasure in the fact that I got away
with
something that she&#8217;d croak over! Maybe this wasn&#8217;t so bad after all.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
was feeling pretty good at that point as I
rounded the hallway and entered the dining room &#8211; that is until I saw
two
teenage boys sitting at the table! I stopped in mid stride and looked
around
the room. Everyone else was getting seated and the only empty chair I
spotted
was at the smaller table where the boys were sitting. Granny must have
noticed
my hesitation and apparently felt the need to introduce these two
forgotten
souls.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Boys,
this is my Granddaughter, Katie. &#8220;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Both
teens just giggled as they looked at me. One
of them mocked me by asking, &#8220;Did you forget something, Girlie?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now
boys, there&#8217;ll be none of that. Mind your
manners as you&#8217;re a guest in this house,&#8221; some man said curtly. I took
it that
he must have been their father as they straightened up and got very
quiet.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
spotted Danny sitting with her family and had
been hoping to sit with her but there wasn&#8217;t room. In fact the ONLY
chair was
at the small table with the boys. &#8220;Have a seat so we can say the
blessing,&#8221;
Granny said as she pointed at the empty chair. Having no choice, I
reluctantly
did as she had suggested while giving the boys a stern look that I was
hoping
conveyed to them that I wasn&#8217;t going to tolerate any foolishness. It
was bad
enough having adults see me naked but two teenage boys close to my age
was
overwhelming. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">All
through the blessing I avoided looking at
them instead glancing down at the table. I told myself that I HAD to
act like I
was confident otherwise they&#8217;d sense my weakness and pick on me the
rest of the
night. Act confident? Yeah right. My stomach was turning summersaults
and my
throat was as dry as a desert. My naked boobs were not two feet from
their
faces at this small table!!! To make matters worse I was as wet as I&#8217;d
have
ever been in my life! I should have been sitting on a towel not bare
skinned on
a vinyl folding chair!</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">As
the food was passed around the boys kept
quietly snickering amongst themselves and elbowing each other in their
sides as
if they were sharing some secret joke. There was a joke alright, and I
was it! I
looked up across the table as one of the boys held out the plate with
rolls for
me to take one and a light went off in my head. It recognized that boy!
He was
the troublemaker at the lake the other day that insisted that he saw
me. HA! I
had seen that boy naked!! Suddenly I wasn&#8217;t so scared anymore. The
playing
field was suddenly level. As I held his gaze while holding onto the
plate that
he had in his hand he too must have made the connection and got this
nervous
look about him. &#8220;GOTCHA, you little twerp&#8221; I whispered softly, just
loud enough
for him to hear. I know he heard me too because he lowered his eyes as
he let
go of the plate. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
kept staring at him almost making a game out
of it imagining in my head what his little Willie looked like. Oh this
was
fun!! I thought to myself. I&#8217;m the one sitting across the table with a
boy who
likes to skinny-dip! A little voice in my head kept singing a taunting
melody,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you naked . . . I&#8217;ve seen you naked!&#8221; It was juvenile I
know, but it
kept me from feeling the stress of sitting in a room full of people
wearing
just a silly hat. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Though
the thoughts in my head may have lowered
my anxiety; they were also making me more and more aroused. I wasn&#8217;t
frightened
any more &#8211; I was downright horny! I could feel my nipples hardening and
sticking further out and my areolas were getting quite puffy. I had to
be
careful as I was sure people would notice and that would not be a good
thing! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">His
friend kept snickering as he looked at me
while he ate so I felt I had to do something. So, in a rather loud
voice &#8211;
louder than the murmuring of conversations going on at the main table
among the
adults, I said, &#8220;So boys, did you have fun swimming at the lake
yesterday?&#8221;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">A
look of terror came over both of them which
filled my heart with glee. I owned them now! It was quite clear that
they knew
I was about to tell the whole room that they were swimming naked. One
of the
boys shook his head almost as if he was pleading with me not to say
anything
more while the other looked as if all the color had run out of his
face. Suddenly
I became aware of the sexual nature of my situation. I could tease and
taunt
these boys with my body frustrating them to no end as there wasn&#8217;t a
thing they
could do about it. They couldn&#8217;t tease me anymore either because I held
the
&#8220;Ace.&#8221; I could spill the beans about the gang of boys that liked to run
around
without clothes. To seal the deal and cement my control over these two,
I
leaned forward and whispered softly, &#8220;I wonder what your mother would
think if
she found out what you like to do at the lake.&#8221; Both just looked
terrified but
they said nothing. </span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">I
then messed with them good. If I HAD to be
attending this party in just a hat I might as well have a little fun. I
sat up
and reached over the table to pick up the salt and then put it back
making sure
that my breasts dangled temptingly in front of their eyes. As I sat
down I saw
the boy that I called, The Troublemaker, swallow hard while the other
just
loosened the collar on his shirt. I had never realized how much fun it
could be
teasing boys! I crossed my legs under the table and &#8220;accidentally&#8221; but
very
seductively, brushed the leg of one of the boys with my foot, rubbing
his calf
a little while looking at him in the eye. I thought the poor fellow was
going
to faint! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
boys stopped eating, and for the most part,
all they could do was stare at my breasts! They were like a magnet to
them that
held their eyes firm. I wondered if either of them was sporting a boner
yet.
Before, when they ogled my body it made me self-conscious. Now I was
relishing
the attention. Just to make sure of their discomfort, I spotted a bowl
of peas
at the adult table and decided that I wanted some of them. I slowly got
up
lingering long enough for them to get a good view of my pelvis and then
I
carefully turned around so that my butt was only inches away from one
of them
as I bent over. I excused myself to the woman at the adult table and
asked her
to pass the bowl of peas. I just knew the boys were looking at my vulva
from
the back and I was eating it up!! I didn&#8217;t know what had come over me,
really.
Was I enjoying the attention like I first thought or was it the power
that I
felt over these two that I was relishing? In either case I was
thoroughly
enjoying myself! </span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After
taking the bowl and turning around to face
my table again it was better than I had hoped. BOTH of them had their
eyes
glued to my labia. They weren&#8217;t looking at my eyes and they certainly
weren&#8217;t
looking at their plates. They were looking at my sex! For the first
time in my
life I thought, &#8220;Damn, it&#8217;s good to be a woman!&#8221;</span>
