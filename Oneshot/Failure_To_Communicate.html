<p><br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Description : </span><br>
A bit of humor and fluff. When Peter learns that his best friend,
Kristin, broke his younger brother Tommy's heart, he takes matters into
his own hands. Peter forces Kristin to undress and tells her that he
won't give her back her clothes unless she agrees to go on a date with
Tommy. Left alone, naked and shivering, Kristin wonders how embarrassed
Peter will be when he finds out what <em>really</em> happened between Kristin and Tommy ... <br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Cast of Characters </span><br> Peter, 17 <br> Kristin, 16 <br> Tommy, 14 <br> </p><p></p><p> "Kristin, please, don't make this harder than it needs to be. Just take off your clothes. Everything will be all right." <br> <br> The words might have been intended to be soothing. They were anything but. <br> <br>
Kristin could only stare in disbelief at her best friend ... or, at
least, the boy she had always thought of as her best friend. Now she
was looking at him as if she had never seen him before. <br> <br> "Peter, what is this about? Why did you bring me here?" <br> <br>
The pretty, auburn-haired 16-year-old girl backed up a few steps, which
was about as far as she could go in the tiny abandoned shed, in the
middle of nowhere, that Kristin and Peter were standing in. <br> <br> "I will explain that," promised Peter. "But for now, just do as I say. Strip." <br> <br> Kristin wrapped her arms around herself, shivering – whether from the cold or the fear, she wasn't sure. <br> <br> "What are you going to do to me?" she asked, in a small voice. <br> <br> It was only then that Peter realized what Kristin was afraid of. <br> <br> <em>Of course</em>,
he thought, grimacing. There was only one place that a girl's mind
would go under these circumstances. He mentally kicked himself for
being so wrapped up in his own indignation that he never thought of how
this would look. <br> <br> "I'm not going to hurt you." Peter took a
few steps back, as far as the interior of the small shed would allow
him. He held up his hands disarmingly. "I won't touch you, I promise." <br> <br>
"So is this just to see me naked, then?" Kristin glared at him in
disgust. "Cripes, Peter, why can't you just peek at girls in the shower
like most boys do?" <br> <br> "No." Peter shook his head. "This isn't about getting some cheap thrill." <br> <br> "Then what is it about?" <br> <br> "I just want to talk. That's all." <br> <br>
"Can't we talk with my clothes on?" Kristin sighed in frustration.
"Peter, if this isn't about seeing me naked ... Just tell me why you want
me to strip." <br> <br> "Because I don't have anything to tie you up with." <br> <br> " ... Oh, of course!" exclaimed Kristin, slapping her forehead. "How silly of me! Now it all makes perfect sense!" <br> <br> "You know, Kristin, sarcasm does not become you." <br> <br> "And being naked would, I suppose." <br> <br> "Well, actually, I always kind of thought ..." <br> <br> Kristin reddened as Peter's eyes slid down her body. <br> <br> "Peter, for crying out loud, I'm not even naked yet." <br> <br> "So I've noticed. Look, Kristin, I brought you here because I needed to talk to you about something important." <br> <br> "Fine. Talk, then." <br> <br>
"It's not that simple. After we're done talking, I'm going to leave you
alone in here for a while, to think about what I said. And I need to
make sure that you don't try to run off. Since I can't tie you up ...
Well, I figure that you won't be in a real hurry to go anywhere if
you're naked." <br> <br> "What do you have to talk to me about that is so important?" <br> <br> "I'll get to that. But first, get undressed." <br> <br> " ... What if I just refuse, Peter? What would you do about it?" <br> <br> Peter sighed. <br> <br> "I was afraid you'd ask me that." <br> <br> He took a deep breath. <br> <br>
"Kristin," said Peter, taking one deliberate step toward her, and then
another, "if you refuse to undress yourself, then I'm going to have to
take matters into my own hands. Literally." <br> <br> For a moment, the words just hung there, and Kristin could do nothing but stare at her friend, aghast. <br> <br> "You'd really do that to me?" Kristin's voice was barely above a whisper. <br> <br> Peter looked at the floor. <br> <br> "I don't know," he admitted. "I'm hoping that you won't make us find out." <br> <br> With some effort, he looked Kristin in the eyes. <br> <br> "The only thing I know for sure is that it will go a lot easier on you if you do it yourself, Kristin." <br> <br>
Kristin was silent for a long moment. Then, finally accepting that
Peter was serious, she slowly reached for her blouse and began to
unbutton it. <br> <br> "Good," said Peter with relief. "Look, Kristin,
I want to get this over with as quickly as possible, and I'm thinking
that you'd like that, too." <br> <br> "I can't believe you're doing
this," said Kristin. She finished unbuttoning her blouse and
reluctantly pulled it open, revealing her full, firm breasts, encased
in a silk bra. <br> <br> "Come on, Kristin, it's not <em>that</em> bad," said Peter. "I've seen you naked before, remember? That time in our old treehouse." <br> <br> "That was when we were <em>five!"</em> exclaimed Kristin. She pulled the blouse off her shoulders, along with her dark blue blazer. <br> <br> Peter's eyes travelled admiringly from Kristin's chest down her tight stomach, as she unzipped her skirt. Kristin hesitated. <br> <br> "Isn't this enough?" she whined. <br> <br> "Take off the skirt, Kristin." <br> <br> Kristin bit her lip, and then pushed down her skirt ... with great reluctance ... and Peter soon saw why. <br> <br> "Kristin," said Peter, openly gaping at her, "do you <em>often</em> wear pink and yellow panties with little teddy bears on them?" <br> <br> Kristin scowled. <br> <br> "Well, it's not a garment that I normally display to the public," she retorted through clenched teeth. <br> <br>
Kristin discarded her skirt, trying to ignore Peter's gaze on her long,
slim legs. She stiffened for a moment, and then pulled off her shoes
and socks – delaying the inevitable by a matter of seconds. <br> <br> "Peter, please," said Kristin. "Don't make me do this." <br> <br> "Everything off, Kristin," came the expected reply. <br> <br>
Tears formed in Kristin's eyes as she unhooked her bra and slowly
pulled it off, baring her large breasts and pert nipples to Peter's
sight. As embarrassing as it was to be seen in the kiddie panties, it
was nothing compared to how mortified she felt upon removing them. <br> <br> "There, I'm naked," said Kristin redundantly, tossing her panties on the small pile of her discarded clothing. <br> <br>
She certainly was. Peter had always thought of his friend as pretty,
but he hadn't grasped until now just how beautiful she really was. Nor
did he ever think he would see her beauty in full, like this. <br> <br> "Wow," was all Peter could think to say, his eyes drinking in all of Kristin's lovely peaches-and-cream skin ... and he did mean <em>all</em> of it. <br> <br> ... Well, <em>almost</em> all of it. <br> <br>
Kristin froze as Peter began approaching her. Her only movement now was
her long, light auburn hair slightly swaying in the breeze creaking
through the walls of the shed. <br> <br> Peter walked around her – a
bit of a squeeze in the small shed, but he managed it – and peeked at
the creamy skin of her tight, perfectly formed rear. <em>Now</em> he had seen all of her skin. <br> <br> "Sorry," said Peter, half-smiling, half-sheepish. "Just couldn't resist." <br> <br>
Kristin was in agony. She could not recall ever feeling so humiliated
in her life. At that moment, she wanted nothing more than for the
ground to open up and swallow her whole. <br> <br> "Wow," said Peter
again, licking his lips as he continued taking in the sight of
Kristin's naked body. "You, uh ... You definitely didn't look like this
in the treehouse." <br> <br> "Thank you, I think," said Kristin sullenly. <br> <br> Peter held his breath. <br> <br> <em>Tommy is the one who likes Kristin, not me,</em> he reminded himself. <em>Kristin
is my best friend. She's practically my sister ... My extremely,
incredibly, amazingly sexy sister, yes, but my sister, nevertheless.</em> <br> <br>
But Peter could not help staring at his best friend's beauty, laid bare
to his sight. After a long moment, though, Kristin snapped him out of
his reverie. <br> <br> "Peter, I can't believe you did this to me." Kristin wiped a tear from her cheek. "I thought we were friends." <br> <br> "We <em>are</em> friends," said Peter. He paused. "At least, we <em>were</em> friends, and I hope that after this, we will be again. But for now, for right now ... You are not my friend, Kristin." <br> <br> Peter steeled himself. <br> <br> "What you are, right now, Kristin, is the girl who broke my little brother's heart." <br> <br> "I broke your – When did I do that?" Kristin looked bewildered. <br> <br> "Did you really think I wouldn't find out?" demanded Peter. "Tommy told me that you wouldn't go out with him." <br> <br> "He – He told you that?" Kristin was stunned. "But, Peter, Tommy – " <br> <br>
"Save it, Kristin," said Peter curtly. "You know, I am getting really
tired of listening to you make stupid excuses for not dating somebody."
<br> <br> "I don't do that." <br> <br> "Oh, no? What about the time you refused to go out with a guy because he had the same color hair as you?" <br> <br> "I was afraid people would think I was dating my brother." <br> <br> "And the time you stopped dating a guy because he was too happy all the time?" <br> <br> "Peter, I don't know if you've ever tried to have a conversation with somebody who never stops smiling. <em>Ever.</em> I advise you not to try." <br> <br> "You broke up with a guy because he owned a cat." <br> <br> "He talked to it, Peter. And by that, I mean he talked to it like it was his mother. He wanted to know if the cat <em>approved</em> of me dating him." <br> <br> "One guy, because of the way he spelled his name." <br> <br> "His name was Mike, and he spelled it M-Y-K-E. Which wasn't so bad, but he insisted on spelling <em>my</em> name K-R-Y-S-T-Y-N." <br> <br> "What about the time you broke up with a guy because he had thin lips?" <br> <br> "Peter, it was like making out with an envelope." <br> <br> "That one guy, because he kept saying 'supposably' instead of 'supposedly.'" <br> <br> "Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a bad sitcom." <br> <br> <em>"Kristin."</em> Peter shook his head in frustration. "Look, I know that Tommy is a little young for you – " <br> <br> "That has nothing to do with – " <br> <br> " – and he's not a jock, or popular, or anything – " <br> <br> "I don't care about – " <br> <br> " – and, to be honest, you can be a little shallow sometimes – " <br> <br> "Hey!" <br> <br> "Kristin, I can't believe you wouldn't even give Tommy a chance!" Peter struggled to refrain from yelling. <br> <br> Kristin stared at Peter. <br> <br> "Let me get this straight," said Kristin angrily. "Tommy actually came to you and told you that I refused to go out with him?" <br> <br>
"No." Peter looked away. "He didn't come to me. I saw that he was upset
about something, and I asked him what was wrong. He didn't want to tell
me. I had to pry it out of him." <br> <br> "Peter, what exactly did Tommy tell you that I did?" <br> <br> "He didn't tell me much of anything, really. The poor guy seemed so embarrassed, he couldn't talk about it much ... " <br> <br> * * * * * <br> <br> <em>"Hey, Tommy." Peter walked into the kitchen, tossing his book bag onto a chair.</em> <br> <br> <em>"Hi, Pete," said Tommy in a dull voice, not looking up from the book he was reading.</em> <br> <br> <em>"You okay?" asked Peter.</em> <br> <br> <em>"Fine." Tommy turned a page in his book, very slowly.</em> <br> <br> <em>"Something bothering you?" asked Peter, sitting down next to his brother.</em> <br> <br> <em>"I don't want to talk about it," said Tommy.</em> <br> <br> <em>"C'mon, little brother, you know you can always talk to me," pressed Peter. "What's the matter?"</em> <br> <br> <em>Tommy sighed.</em> <br> <br> <em>"It's Kristin," he finally said.</em> <br> <br> <em>"What about Kristin?"</em> <br> <br> <em>"She won't go out with me," said Tommy gloomily.</em> <br> <br> <em>"What?" Peter asked in surprise. "You mean, you finally asked her for a date – and she turned you down?"</em> <br> <br> <em>Tommy shook his head.</em> <br> <br> <em>"Pete, I really don't want to talk about it," he said, sounding embarrassed. He pulled his book up to cover his face.</em> <br> <br> <em>"Tommy, come on, I want to help."</em> <br> <br> <em>"You can't," said Tommy flatly. "Nobody can."</em> <br> <br> <em>"But – "</em> <br> <br> <em>"Pete, there's nothing you can do. There's nothing anyone can do. Kristin won't go out with me. That's all there is to it."</em> <br> <br> <em>"Tommy, at least tell me what happened," persisted Peter.</em> <br> <br> <em>"I don't want to talk about it," Tommy repeated, getting up from the table. "Just drop it, Pete, okay?"</em> <br> <br> <em>Tommy put his book in his school bag.</em> <br> <br> <em>"I'm going to the library," he said. "I need to study. Tell Mom I'll be home around seven."</em> <br> <br> <em>"Look, Tommy, I'll talk to Kristin," said Peter. "Maybe I can – "</em> <br> <br> <em>"No!"
said Tommy heatedly. "Don't talk to her, Peter. Don't say anything
about this to her, or to anyone else. I told you, there's nothing you
can do, and I don't want to talk about it anymore. Just drop it, Pete."</em> <br> <br> <em>Tommy walked out of the kitchen, leaving Peter to silently contemplate what he had just heard.</em> <br> <br> * * * * * <br> <br> "Is that all he said?" asked Kristin. <br> <br> "Pretty much," grumbled Peter. "He was too embarrassed to say any more." <br> <br> "Well, it's too bad that he didn't," said Kristin. "Because there's something you should know about – " <br> <br>
"Stop." Peter put up his hands. "Kristin, whatever it was that happened
between you and Tommy, he was obviously humiliated enough by it that he
didn't want me to know. So, out of respect for his feelings, I don't
want to know." <br> <br> "But, Peter – " <br> <br> "It's between you and Tommy," continued Peter, "and I want to respect his privacy. And yours, too, Kristin." <br> <br>
Kristin thought it was pretty gutsy of Peter to say he wanted to
respect her privacy after he stripped her naked and ogled every inch of
her body. <br> <br> "Peter," she said, through gritted teeth, "You say
that Tommy told you not to talk to me about this, not to say or do
anything. He told you to drop it ... Is <em>this</em> your idea of dropping it?" <br> <br>
Kristin held out her arms, giving Peter a full, unobstructed view of
her naked body. It was a view that Peter certainly didn't mind, but he
wouldn't let it distract him. <br> <br> "You're my best friend,
Kristin, and I love you, but I wasn't going to let you get away with
breaking my brother's heart," said Peter pointedly. <br> <br> "But, Peter, I couldn't have – Look, Peter, I think I know why Tommy told you to drop it. You see, Tommy – " <br> <br> "It's obvious why he told me to drop it, Kristin. He was humiliated by whatever it was you did to him." <br> <br> "I didn't do anything to him!" insisted Kristin. <br> <br> "Yeah, right!" said Peter disdainfully. "What was it, Kristin? Did you laugh in his face? Did you make fun of him?" <br> <br>
"I would never do that! Peter, I love your brother! Tommy is the
sweetest boy I know! And I love spending time with him! I just didn't –
" <br> <br> "You don't have to tell me what you did, Kristin." Peter
sighed. "I know that you're not seeing anybody right now, so that can't
be an issue." <br> <br> "No, I'm not, but – " <br> <br> "So it must be Tommy, then. What's wrong with him?" <br> <br> "Nothing! I just – " <br> <br> "You wouldn't even give him ... Enough!" <br> <br> Peter bent down and gathered up Kristin's clothing. <br> <br> "Wh-What are you doing?" asked Kristin nervously. <br> <br> "I'm going to put your clothes in my car," replied Peter. <br> <br> "Peter, you can't leave me here like this!" exclaimed Kristin, horrified. <br> <br> "I'm not going to leave you here, Kristin," promised Peter. "I'm just going to give you some time to think things over." <br> <br> "But, Peter – " <br> <br> "Hush." <br> <br>
Peter opened the door to the shed. Kristin wrapped her arms around
herself, shivering at the blast of cold air that swept in from outside.
<br> <br> "I'll be right back, Kristin. Don't go anywhere." <br> <br> "Don't worry," muttered Kristin. <br> <br> Peter closed the door to the shed. For a few minutes, Kristin could only stand and shiver, until Peter returned. <br> <br> "What are you going to do now?" asked Kristin anxiously. <br> <br> Peter took another deep breath. This was the moment. <br> <br> "Kristin ... You are not getting your clothes back until you agree to go on a date with Tommy." <br> <br> Kristin was speechless. <br> <br> "You actually think that <em>this</em> is going to make me want to go out with your brother?" she said incredulously. <br> <br> Peter reddened. <br> <br>
"Kristin, don't hold this against Tommy," he pleaded. "He had nothing
to do with it. I'm doing it all on my own. He doesn't even know about
it. In fact, I'm pretty sure he'd have a fit if he did." <br> <br> "I'm guessing he would." Kristin nodded. "Because there's something that you clearly don't – " <br> <br> "I'm sorry that it came to this, Kristin, I really am," said Peter. "But Tommy loves you ... He <em>really</em>
loves you, Kristin. And if this is the only way I could get you to give
him a chance ... I want my brother to be happy, and whether you believe
it or not, Kristin, I want you to be happy, too." <br> <br> "Peter, I don't – " <br> <br>
"You just stay here and think things over," said Peter. He stepped out
the doorway, and began pulling the door closed. "When I come back, I
hope that you will be willing to be a little more reasonable about
giving Tommy a chance." <br> <br> "Peter, can't I have <em>something</em> to wear?" asked Kristin desperately. "Please, Peter, it's cold in here!" <br> <br> Kristin wasn't sure whether her plea was more for warmth, or just to cover herself up. <br> <br> "You're not getting anywhere near your clothes until we've settled this," said Peter firmly. <br> <br>
"Couldn't I just have my underwear back?" Kristin shivered. "Come on,
Peter, do you really think I'd go running down the street in my bra and
panties?" <br> <br> "A bra and panties don't cover any more than a bikini," Peter pointed out. <br> <br> "I wouldn't go running down the street in a bikini, either!" said Kristin. "Especially one with <em>pink and yellow teddy bears</em> on it!" <br> <br> "I can't take that chance, Kristin. I'm sorry." <br> <br> Peter pulled the door closed. <br> <br> "Please, Kristin, just think about it," said Peter through the door. <br> <br>
A moment later, Kristin heard Peter's footsteps as he walked away from
the shed. Kristin could do nothing but stand there, naked, and quiver
from both the cold and the embarrassment. <br> <br> Kristin wasn't
sure how long Peter intended to leave her in the shed, but she chose to
take his advice and think about her situation. Not that she had much
else to do. <br> <br> After a while, Kristin inexplicably began to
giggle. She knew that she should be furious about everything that had
happened, but despite herself, she couldn't help laughing at the
absurdity of it all. Now, she really did feel like she was living in a
bad sitcom. <br> <br> If she was to be honest, Kristin actually felt a
little flattered. She wasn't blind ... Kristin had always known that her
best friend's brother had a crush on her. But she hadn't realized until
now just <em>how</em> lovesick he really was. She had also known Tommy was shy, but never realized just how painfully shy he really was ... <br> <br>
She thought about Peter, about how much he obviously loved his little
brother, and how that love was obviously making him oblivious to the
failure of communication – several failures of communication, really –
along the line. Poor Peter was going to be so embarrassed when he found
out the truth ... <br> <br> Most of all, Kristin thought over and over about what Peter had said. <br> <br> <em>"Tommy told me that you wouldn't go out with him."</em> <br> <br> "Oh, Tommy," murmured Kristin, shaking her head in amusement. "You could have at least <strong><em>ASKED</em></strong>."</p>
